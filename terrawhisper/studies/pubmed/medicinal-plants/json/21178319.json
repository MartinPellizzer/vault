The present study was performed to investigate the effect of Aloe vera oral administration on open wounds in type 2 diabetic rats. Full thickness open wounds (1.5 \u00d7 1.5 cm) were created under general anesthesia on the backs of the rats. These rats were divided into two group, a control group (Group C) and an Aloe vera oral administration group (Group A). Each wound area was measured on days 1, 2, 4 and 8 postwounding. The stages of wound granulation tissues were evaluated histopathologically. The expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by immunohistochemically. The wounds were significantly contracted in Group A on days 2, 4 and 8 postwounding. Histological results revealed that the inflammatory cell infiltration, angiogenesis, extracellular matrix deposition and epithelialization were promoted in Group A, respectively. The immunohistochemical results revealed that both TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF protein-positive cells increased in Group A on day 4 postwounding. We concluded that Aloe vera oral administration accelerated wound healing in type 2 diabetic rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The United Graduate School of Veterinary Sciences, Gifu University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atiba", "ForeName": "Ayman", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ueno", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uzuka", "ForeName": "Yuji", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Vet Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9105360", "ISSNLinking": "0916-7250"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21178319", "10.1292/jvms.10-0438", "JST.JSTAGE/jvms/10-0438"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
