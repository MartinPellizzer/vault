This herb is renowned for its ability to clear heat and detoxify the body, alleviate cough, and provide relief to the throat. However, the active ingredients and the potential mechanism of action remain ambiguity. The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the efficacy of H. plantaginea in treating pneumonia, identify its active ingredients and unveil the pharmacological mechanism in the treatment of pneumonia. In vivo experiments demonstrate the plant's anti-pneumonia properties, while mass spectrometry analysis identifies 62 chemicals, with 14 absorbed into the bloodstream. Network pharmacology and Venn analysis reveal 195 targets of 52 active ingredients, with 49 gene targets common to H. plantaginea and pneumonia. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analysis highlight the key targets and pathways such as AKT, EGFR, IL-17. Western blotting confirms downregulation of these pathways, indicating the anti-inflammatory effects of H. plantaginea in treating acute lung injury. Our findings showed that the treatment of ALI with the H. plantaginea exerts its anti-inflammatory effects through multiple components, targets, and pathways. This study established a solid experimental foundation for investigating the various components, targets, and pathways involved in the treatment of pneumonia using H. plantaginea. It offers valuable insights from multiple perspectives and can serve as a reference for the clinical application of this plant in pneumonia treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
