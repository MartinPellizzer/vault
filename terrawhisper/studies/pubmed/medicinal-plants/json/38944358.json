The origin of the genus, its toxicology, and the use of classical therapies in modern medicine were also discussed. It provides references for historical evidence, resource development, and medical research on the genus.", "ology: Data about the genus L. were gathered via Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Connected Papers, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), electronic ancient books and local chronicles. The WFO Plant List (wfoplantlist.org) and Flora of China (www.iplant.cn) confirmed L.'s Latin name, and the species information. The program ChemBioDraw Ultra 14.0 was used to create the molecular structures of the compounds that were displayed in the text.", "Currently, at least 740 constituents have been isolated and identified from L. These include 9 groups of chemicals, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids. They have been shown to have over 20 biological properties in vivo and in vitro, such as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects.", "Based on pharmacological investigations, chemical components, and traditional folk applications, L. is considered a medicinal plant having a variety of pharmacological actions. However, although the pharmacological activity of the L. genus has been preliminary demonstrated, most have only been assessed using simple in vitro cell lines or animal disease models. In order to fully elucidate the pharmacological activity and mechanisms of L., future studies should be conducted in a more comprehensive clinical manner."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
