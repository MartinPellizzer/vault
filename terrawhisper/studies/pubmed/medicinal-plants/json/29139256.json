As the medicinal value of P. umbellatus and A. mellea is increasingly wide concerned, the market quantity demanded of them is gradually increased and the demand outstrips the supply. The symbiotic A. mellea and P. umbellatus are both the medicinal and edible fungi with diverse activities, including hypoglycemic action, improve immunity and antitumor and so on. The growth of the sclerotia forming from the mycelium of P. umbellatus is related to the infection of the symbiotic A. mellea and their secondary products. In this study, by comparing the chemical constituents of the mycelium and sclerotia of P. umbellatus and A. mellea, we found that they all produced steroids and nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The sclerotia of P. umbellatus and A. mellea also produced triterpenes secondary metabolites. In addition, the mycelium and infected sclerotia of P. umbellatus mainly produced different steroids, and the sclerotia produced some other special secondary metabolites, such as long-chain fatty acids, ceramides, phenol and so on. By analyzing above all kinds of differences, speculated that these may be caused by the infection of the symbiotic A. mellea which mainly produced sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and other secondary metabolites. The contents and types of compounds of P. umbellatus and A. mellea are closely related to their symbiosis and reproduction, therefore, many symbiosis mechanisms should be found by utilizing more molecular biology technology to elucidate this complex symbiotic infection and provide scientific basis for improving the yield and quality of P. umbellatus and A. mellea."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510006, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jing-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chang-Jiang-Sheng", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Mengyang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Jingmen 448124, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jun-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Armillaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mycelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyporus"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29139256", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170512.009"]}}]}
