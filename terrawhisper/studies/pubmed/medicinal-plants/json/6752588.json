Publications without supportive experimental data have not been included. It is evident from the data presented in the tables that most of the investigators have failed to include the valuable information on the time and place of collection and proper botanical authentication, if conducted, in their publications. The plants evaluated at the Institute do contain this information and their herbaria sheets are available at CDRI. The plants, with part used, type of extract, isolated compound/chromatographic fraction, dose, route and schedule of administration with animal used, and percentage activity are given in tables. The plants are classified according to their activity profile and presented accordingly. Plants for which the hormonal profile or toxicity data have been reported are dealt with under each type of activity. Most of the investigators did not develop the active plants, probably because of inconsistent results in repeat tests or lack of facilities. Major attention has been devoted to identifying plants with interceptive properties. The schedules used are more or less uniform and acceptable. On the basis of preliminary toxicity data, extracts/compounds from \"Aristolochia indica,\" \"Artemisia scoparia,\" \"Hibiscus rosa sinensis,\" \"Laccardia lacca,\" and \"Plumbago zeylanica\" exclude themselves from consideration for follow-up. Wherever done, the hormonal profiles revealed estrogenic activity in active extracts/fractions/compounds from \"Artabotrys odoratissimus,\" \"Datura quercifolia,\" \"Daucus carota,\" \"Embelia ribes,\" \"Hibiscus rosa sinensis,\" \"Pueraria tuberosa\" and \"Tabernaemontana heyneana.\" Thus they are not ideal for follow-up. Some more plants can be excluded initially because of low activity or equivocal reports on activity. The remaining plants, in order of priority, for follow-up should be \"Ensete superbum,\" \"Achyranthes aspera,\" \"Lygodium flexosum,\" \"Sapindus trifoliatus,\" \"Polygonum hydropiper,\" and \"Abrus precatorius.\" The next priority could be given to plants with weak estrogenicity. The CDRI has observed 100% anti-implantation activity by 4 plants in hamsters. These should be the potential plants for development since they appear to interfere with progesterone synthesis or utilization."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["011408", "00114158"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Health", "Health Services", "Literature Review", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6752588", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "29"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "6", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Research on plants for fertility regulation in India.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "191", "EndPage": "226", "MedlinePgn": "191-226"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamboj", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dhawan", "ForeName": "B N", "Initials": "BN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermatocidal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Semen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocidal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}], "NumberOfReferences": "130"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6752588", "10.1016/0378-8741(82)90004-6", "0378-8741(82)90004-6"]}}]}
