For comparison Bryophyllum daigremontiana (CAM). Saccharum officinarum (C4) and Capsicum frutescens (C3) were treated in the same way. PEP-Co capacity of Aleurites was in the range of 12-, that of Capsicum approx. 26 nmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1), without significant influence of the light period or CO2-treatment. In contrast, the activity of the enzyme from Saccharum was, depending on the duration of light, 160- respectively 96 times higher than that of the tung-oil tree. In Bryophyllum a rather low activity in the morning was increased during the day to approx. 230 nmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1) in plants grown in the greenhouse and to approx. 115 nmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1) in those from the growth chamber. Malate was hardly detectable in extracts of Aleurites, whereas it was high in Bryophyllum, depending on the light period. The ratio of average PEP-Co to Rub-Co capacity was high for the CAM-plant (20:1), somewhat lower for sugar cane (10:1), but almost at equality for Aleurites (0.9:1) and chilli (0.8:1). For the NADP+ malic enzyme, low capacity (20 to 28 nmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1)) was found for Aleurites and for Capsicum, whereas it was 10 to 17 times higher in Saccharum. In Bryophyllum, the activity was up to 80 nmol x min(-1) x mg protein, dependent on light period. MDH capacity was extremely high in all plants investigated. Highest rates (10-20 micromol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1)), were obtained for Bryophyllum, followed by sugar cane and Capsicum with 5-8 micromol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1). Again, the lowest capacity was found in extracts of Aleurites with approx. 1.3 to 1.6 micromol x min(-1) x m protein(-1). Thus, in Aleurites montana no indication for C4- or Crassulacean acid metabolism was obtained. Therefore, the earlier observed very efficient uptake of CO2 cannot be explained by a high expression of the PEP-Co protein, known to occur in CAM- and C4-plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl f\u00fcr Zellphysiologie, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Biologie, Universit\u00e4t Bielefeld, Bundesrepublik Deutschland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grotjohann", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmid", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.37", "NameOfSubstance": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10928549", "10.1515/znc-2000-5-613"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
