To address this threat, attempts are being made by researchers to identify the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) of bacteria. It is believed that unique combinations could be found among the VOCs produced by each microorganism. The current study aimed to identify and compare the VOCs of antibiotic-resistant and standard strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. A polymer of divinylbenzene /carboxen /polydimethylsiloxane was applied for absorption of volatile compounds in headspace bacterial samples in form of a solid phase micro-extraction fiber holder. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique was used for identification of volatile compounds. The analysis of the VOCs indicated that some VOCs appeared only in standard strains while others were common only among resistant strains. Exclusive VOCs to a specific strain were also detected. This study demonstrated that resistant strains of bacteria produced VOCs that were different from those of the standard strains. In addition, VOCs released by bacteria after passing the logarithmic growth phase showed no significant differences. The identification of VOCs can be a precise way to differentiate bacterial species, also it can be said that the VOCs produced by different pathogenic microorganisms can be the suitable biomarkers for their detection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Infections Research Center, Research Institute for Children Health, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karami", "ForeName": "Najmeh", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezadoost", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Protein Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzajani", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Infections Research Center, Research Institute for Children Health, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aliahmadi", "ForeName": "Atousa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric Infections Research Center, Research Institute for Children Health, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Acinetobacter baumannii"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Microextraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30030949"]}}]}
