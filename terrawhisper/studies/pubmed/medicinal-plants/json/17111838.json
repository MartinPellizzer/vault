On the first day, after each fasting rat was intragastrically administered CsA (10 mg x kg(-1)), blood samples (0.2 - 0.25 mL) were collected from the tail vein at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h. From day 4 to day 8, each group began to undergo different pretreatments with intragastric administration of water, verapamil (Ver), low and high dose TMP, separately. On day 9, each group intragastrically co-administered CsA (10 mg x kg(-1)) and different pretreatment compounds mentioned above, then blood samples were collected according to the schedule of the first day. The whole blood concentration of CsA was determined by HPLC. Main pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and compared by statistic analysis.", "In the group of water pretreated and co-administrated with CsA, no significantly different pharmacokinetic parameters of CsA were found. After Ver pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, AUC(0-48 h) and C(max) were increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05); T(1/2) beta and CL were markedly prolonged and decreased (P < 0.05); T(max) and V were not apparently influenced. After low dose TMP pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, there was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters of CsA, in spite of the increasing trends of AUC(0-48 h) and C(max). After high dose TMP pretreatment and co-administration with CsA, AUC(0-48 h) and C(max) of CsA were increased significantly (P < 0.01), but there was no significant change in other parameters.", "It was indicated that the high dose of TMP could apparently increase the intragastric absorption extent of CsA, while almost had no effect on its elimination process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha 410011, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-lei", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Wen-xing", "Initials": "WX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83HN0GTJ6D", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclosporine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CJ0O37KU29", "NameOfSubstance": "Verapamil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V80F4IA5XG", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylpyrazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclosporine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Administration Routes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Verapamil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17111838"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
