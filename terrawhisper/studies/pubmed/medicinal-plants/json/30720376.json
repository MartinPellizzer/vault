This study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical activity and diet before and during pregnancy with the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).<b>Methods:</b> A case-control study was conducted on 173 women with GDM diagnosed during the pregnancy as the case group and 168 women with a negative test for GDM as controls. Weight and height were measured and BMI was calculated. Dietary intake and physical activity data during pregnancy were collected using 24-hour food recall questionnaire and international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ).<b>Results:</b> Body mass index and the intake of refined sugars, high fat dairy products, and fried foods were significantly higher and the intake of fruit and animal oil intake were significantly lower in the case group compared to the control group (All <i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.05). However, there was not any significant association between the level of physical activity, vegetable intake, and total energy intake with the risk of GDM.<b>Conclusions:</b> According to the results of this study, dietary intake before and during the pregnancy have a critical effect on the risk of GDM. Appropriate dietary planning for pregnant women can reduce the risk of GDM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lotfi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hasan", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallahzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Center, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmanian", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Mahdieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, School of Public Health, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lashkardoost", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Health and Environment, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doaei", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholamalizadeh", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shirvan Center of Higher Health Education, Imam Khomeini Hospital, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedi", "ForeName": "Andishe", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101136916", "ISSNLinking": "1476-4954"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes, Gestational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30720376", "10.1080/14767058.2019.1579189"]}}]}
