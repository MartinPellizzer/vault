Thus, plant roots are constantly exposed to silicic acid. High silicon intake, enabled by root silicon transporters, correlates with increased tolerance to many biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the underlying protection mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that silicon interacts with the plant hormones, and specifically, that silicic acid intake increases cytokinin biosynthesis. The reaction of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and Arabidopsis plants, modified to absorb high versus low amounts of silicon, to dark-induced senescence was monitored, by quantifying expression levels of genes along the senescence pathway and measuring tissue cytokinin levels. In both species, detached leaves with high silicon content senesced more slowly than leaves that were not exposed to silicic acid. Expression levels of genes along the senescence pathway suggested increased cytokinin biosynthesis with silicon exposure. Mass spectrometry measurements of cytokinin suggested a positive correlation between silicon exposure and active cytokinin concentrations. Our results indicate a similar reaction to silicon treatment in distantly related plants, proposing a general function of silicon as a stress reliever, acting via increased cytokinin biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9983-167X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R H Smith Institute of Plant Sciences and Genetics in Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel."}], "LastName": "Markovich", "ForeName": "Oshry", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R H Smith Institute of Plant Sciences and Genetics in Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel."}], "LastName": "Steiner", "ForeName": "Evyatar", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Central Laboratories and Research Support, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Kou\u0159il", "ForeName": "\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n", "Initials": "\u0160"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Central Laboratories and Research Support, Faculty of Science, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Tarkowski", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant and Environmental Science, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel."}], "LastName": "Aharoni", "ForeName": "Asaph", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R H Smith Institute of Plant Sciences and Genetics in Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel."}], "LastName": "Elbaum", "ForeName": "Rivka", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "9309004", "ISSNLinking": "0140-7791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4152N8IUI", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sorghum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28102542", "10.1111/pce.12913"]}}]}
