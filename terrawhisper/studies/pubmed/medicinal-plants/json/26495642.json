The global potential suitability regions of Artemisia annua were analyzed by ArcGIS.", "Artemisia annua distributed in three longitude zones, including 90. 55 \u00b0W - 77. 14 \u00b0W, 2. 03 \u00b0E - 11. 75 \u00b0E and 98. 27 \u00b0E - 111. 05 \u00b0E,which were respectively in North America, Europe and Asia. The latitude range was mainly 29. 15 \u00b0N - 51. 36 \u00b0 N. 80% of Artemisia annua were in the regions which elevation range was 22. 00 - 491. 00 m, annual precipitation was 492. 30 ~ 1 366. 70 mm, annual average temperature was from 8. 10 to 17. 27 \u00b0C. The potential suitability regions of Artemisia annua with 95% ~ 100% climate similarity were mainly in 30 \u00b0S and 30 \u00b0N regions, centered around the equator axis. Conclusion: Latitude is closely related to the distribution of Artemisia annua, the key affecting climatic factors are annual precipitation, the wettest season precipitation, the warmest season precipitation and the highest temperature in the warmest month, the average temperature of the warmest season, as well as the average temperature of the wettest season. The potential suitability regions of Artemnisia annua are in eastern North America, western Europe and eastern Asia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Fan-lin", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Cai-xiang", "Initials": "CX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26495642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
