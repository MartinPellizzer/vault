A specific HPLC method was developed for evaluating the DPPH free radical scavenging activity of commercial polyherbal formulations using a LiChrospher 100 RP-18e column (250 mm x 4 mm, 5 microM). The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol and water (80:20, v/v) pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The DPPH peaks were monitored at 517 nm. The method was standardized using known antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), probucol and alpha-tocopherol. The 50% radical scavenging activity (IC50) determined by the HPLC method correlated well with that of colorimetry. This HPLC method was applied for the estimation of free radical scavenging activity of Silymarin and a few commercial hepatoprotective polyherbal formulations. While the colorimetric method failed to estimate the free radical scavenging activity of polyherbal formulations, HPLC method was free from interferences and was specific. The HPLC method is sensitive and can be used as a quality control tool for the rapid determination of free radical scavenging activity of variety of products including plant extracts, foods, drugs and polyherbal formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Uppal Road, Tarnaka, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chandrasekar", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madhusudhana", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramakrishna", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diwan", "ForeName": "Prakash V", "Initials": "PV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silymarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silymarin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16297590", "10.1016/j.jpba.2005.07.042", "S0731-7085(05)00509-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
