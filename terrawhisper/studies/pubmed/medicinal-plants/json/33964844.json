From the Black Sea, oils and extracts from plants in large numbers growing in Georgia. When studying the physicochemical characteristics of the products obtained and their compliance with standards, tests according to GOST 31460-2012 were used. \"Cosmetic creams\" and GOST 31679-2012. \"Liquid cosmetic products\", as well as a number of additional tests to assess their quality.

The results of the study were determined visually and according to the objective feelings of the volunteers. The data obtained make it possible to assess the improvement in the sensory properties of the skin. All of the above indicates the possibility of using the developed products in cosmetics and cosmeceutics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Institute of Pharmacochemistry I.
