As constituents with potential contact allergenic and toxic properties in crude Ginkgo extracts a group of alkylphenols (e.g., ginkgolic acids, ginkgol, bilobol) has been described. Thus, for reasons of drug safety a maximal concentration (< or = 5 ppm) of ginkgolic acids is requested by the Monograph of the Commission E of the former German Federal Health Agency (Bundesgesundheitsamt, BGA). During production of the standardized Ginkgo extract EGb 761, alkylphenols are largely eliminated as water insoluble compounds (decanter sludge) from the primary acetone extract. To further assess the adverse properties of alkylphenols, different fractions derived from the decanter sludge were evaluated for their embryotoxic effects in the hen's egg test (HET). A fraction enriched for ginkgolic acids (16%) and biflavones (6.7%) was found to induce death of 50% of the chick embryos (LD50) at a dose of 1.8 mg/egg (approximately/= 33 ppm). A similar strong lethal effect (LD50: 3.5 mg/egg; 64 ppm) was oberserved for a fraction which contained 58% ginkgolic acids but less than 0.02% biflavones. In contrast, an extreme low toxic potential (LD50: 250 mg/egg or 4540 ppm) was established for a fraction containing 16% biflavones and 1% ginkgolic acids. Thus, the present investigations confirm the high toxic potential of ginkgolic acids, although it can not be excluded that biflavones or some other constituents in the different fractions may amplify the adverse effect of these substances. Since no contribution of alkylphenols to the therapeutic efficacy of Ginkgo extracts has been confirmed and their elimination during the manufacturing process does not cause technical problems, these results further support the requirement for the completest possible removal of these compounds under toxicological considerations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baron-Ruppert", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luepke", "ForeName": "N P", "Initials": "NP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resorcinols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22910-60-7", "NameOfSubstance": "ginkgolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22910-86-7", "NameOfSubstance": "bilobol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Resorcinols"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11315756", "10.1078/0944-7113-00022", "S0944-7113(04)70021-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
