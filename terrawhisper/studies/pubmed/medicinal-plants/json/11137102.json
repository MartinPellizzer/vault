Health claims regarding the cholesterol lowering benefits of garlic are widespread. However, the clinical trial data are inconsistent. The effect of two doses of a commercial garlic preparation on plasma lipids were evaluated, compared to a placebo, in moderately hypercholesterolemic adults (baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)=157. 4+/-18.7, mean+/-S.D.). Fifty-one adults, aged 51.8+/-8.3 years participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment trial conducted in an outpatient research clinic. They were randomized to a placebo or a garlic botanical blend providing 500 or 1000 mg dehydrated garlic powder/day (three groups, 16-18 subjects per group). Plasma lipids were assessed every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. The study was designed with sufficient power to detect a 10% relative decline in LDL-C. The absolute mean changes in LDL-C over 12 weeks were 0.0+/-4.3, +1.4+/-4.8, and -10.1+/-6.8 mg/dl for the placebo, half-dose and full-dose, respectively. In the full-dose group, the LDL-C decrease of 6.1% was not significantly different from the other groups (P=0.5). No significant differences were observed for total- or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or triacylglycerol levels. In conclusion, the garlic powder preparation used in this study among moderately hypercholesterolemic adults did not significantly effect plasma lipids levels. There was no indication of a graded affect by garlic dose over the range of 0, 500 and 1000 mg/day. A small (<10%) effect on LDL-C levels or a threshold effect requiring larger doses are not eliminated by this study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention and the Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical School, 730 Welch Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1583, USA. cgardner@scrdp.stanford.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardner", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carlson", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Atherosclerosis", "NlmUniqueID": "0242543", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9150"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Failure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11137102", "10.1016/s0021-9150(00)00466-4", "S0021-9150(00)00466-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
