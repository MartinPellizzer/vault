The detoxification efficacy of these formulations in cells and DNA levels were derived by MTT and comet assays in toxic PBMCs (incubated with rice whisky or bathroom cleaner).", "The phytochemical constituents were detected at 23.48% phytol and 43.03% oleamide in T. laurifolia; 12.88% oleamide, 20.93% 9,12,15-octadecatrien, 25.52% squalene, 22.19% butylated hydroxy toluene and 15.36% vitamin E in C. disparifolium; and 30.41% phytol, 32.78% oleamide, and 12.20%, 9,12,15-octadecatrien-1-ol in R. serrata. The toxic cells treated with the plant formulas 1, 2 and 3 showed no IC50 values, but formulas 1 and 2 displayed higher efficacies than formula 3 did. The comet assay indicated that the experiments (the treatment on toxic cells with the plant formulas) induced significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage compared to the negative control due to poisoning occurring before administration of the plant formulas. The OTM of the controls was significantly (p < 0.05) longer than the experimental samples showing significantly reduce the toxicity of the created formulations.", "The formulas showed high detoxification efficacies and formulations 1 and 2 resulted in higher levels of detoxification than formulation 3, especially in immediate treatment after receiving toxic substances."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Boonthai", "ForeName": "Prasit", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Noikotr", "ForeName": "Kowit", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Saemram", "ForeName": "Naraphatra", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Law, Khon Kaen University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sudmoon", "ForeName": "Runglawan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environment and Resource Studies, Mahasarakham University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Tanee", "ForeName": "Tawatchai", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Khon Kaen University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Chaveerach", "ForeName": "Arunrat", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Patarapadungkit", "ForeName": "Natcha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science and Technology, Rajabhat Mahasarakham University,Thailand."}], "LastName": "Siripiyasing", "ForeName": "Pornnarong", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acanthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clerodendrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33557734", "10.2174/1389201022666210208145605", "CPB-EPUB-114027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
