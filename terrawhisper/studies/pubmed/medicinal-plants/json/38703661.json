However, some of these alkaloids possess intrinsic toxicity. Processing (Paozhi) is a pre-treatment step before the application of herbal medicines in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics, which has been employed for centuries to mitigate the toxicity of alkaloid-rich TCMs.", "To explore the toxicity phenotypes, chemical basis, mode of action, detoxification processing methods, and underlying mechanisms, we can gain crucial insights into the safe and rational use of these toxic alkaloid-rich herbs. Such insights have the great potential to offer new strategies for drug discovery and development, ultimately improving the quality of life for millions of people.", "Literatures published or early accessed until December 31, 2023, were retrieved from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. The following keywords, such as \"toxicity\", \"alkaloid\", \"detoxification\", \"processing\", \"traditional Chinese medicine\", \"medicinal plant\", and \"plant\", were used in combination or separately for screening.", "Toxicity of alkaloids in TCM includes hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and other forms of toxicity, primarily induced by pyrrolizidines, quinolizidines, isoquinolines, indoles, pyridines, terpenoids, and amines. Factors such as whether the toxic-alkaloid enriched part is limited or heat-sensitive, and whether toxic alkaloids are also therapeutic components, are critical for choosing appropriate detoxification processing methods. Mechanisms of alkaloid detoxification includes physical removal, chemical decomposition or transformation, as well as biological modifications.", "Through this exploration, we review toxic alkaloids and the mechanisms underlying their toxicity, discuss methods to reduce toxicity, and unravel the intricate mechanisms behind detoxification. These offers insights into the quality control of herbs containing toxic alkaloids, safe and rational use of alkaloid-rich TCMs in clinics, new strategies for drug discovery and development, and ultimately helping improve the quality of life for millions of people."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
