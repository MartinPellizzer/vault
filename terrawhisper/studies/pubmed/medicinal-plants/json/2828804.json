Such a material has been shown in other species and has been hypothesized to represent an endogenous ligand for the receptor on Na-K ATPase through which cardiac glycosides act. In rats consuming a normal rodent chow (1% calcium by weight) and drinking deionized water, endogenous binding of digoxin antibody in radioimmunoassay amounted to 23.1 +/- 4.6 fM digoxin equivalents/100 microliter of plasma (mean +/- SEM, n = 8). Since a hypothetical role for such an endogenous ligand is the regulation or renal sodium excretion by inhibition of renal Na-K ATPase, the effect of increased sodium intake on plasma levels of this digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF) was studied. Animals consuming the same chow, but drinking 0.5% NaCl solution in place of water for a 4 week period showed significantly greater DLIF in plasma which was measured at 109.2 +/- 20.3 fM digoxin equivalents/100 microliter of plasma (p less than 0.001). Because DLIF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension we also studied the effects of calcium intake on plasma levels of DLIF. In previous studies we have shown that rats allowed to drink 0.5% saline develop a moderate hypertension which can be reversed with calcium supplementation. In the present studies, 3 dietary calcium subgroups (0.01% Ca, 1.0% Ca and 4% Ca) were formed among animals drinking water or 0.5% saline for 4 weeks. No effect of low calcium intake on plasma DLIF was found either in water or saline drinkers. However, calcium supplementation produced a significant reduction in plasma DLIF in both water and saline drinking animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Cell Biology and Anatomy, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Lubbock 79430."}], "LastName": "Doris", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardenolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "digoxin-like factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Life Sci 1988;43(6):569"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardenolides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2828804", "10.1016/0024-3205(88)90651-0", "0024-3205(88)90651-0"]}}]}
