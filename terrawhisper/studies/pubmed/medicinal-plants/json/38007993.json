Toll-like receptors (TLR), as a key contributor of immune system in inflammation, has a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD and thus, can be a suitable target of therapeutic agents. Medicinal plants have long been considered as a source of bioactive agents for different diseases, including IBD.", "This review discusses current state of the art on the role of plant-derived compounds for the management of IBD with a focus on TLRs.", "Electronic database including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched up to January 2023 and all studies in which anticolitis effects of a phytochemical was assessed via modulation of TLRs were considered.", "Different categories of phytochemicals, including flavonoids, lignans, alkaloids, terpenes, saccharides, and saponins have demonstrated modulatory effects on TLR in different animal and cell models of bowel inflammation. Flavonoids were the most studied phytochemicals amongst others. Also, TLR4 was the most important type of TLRs which were modulated by phytochemicals. Other mechanisms such as inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway, nitric oxide synthesis pathway, cyclooxygenase-2, lipid peroxidation, as well as induction of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms were also reported for phytochemicals in various IBD models.", "Taken together, a growing body of pre-clinical evidence support the efficacy of herbal compounds for the treatment of IBD via modulation of TLRs. Future clinical studies are recommended to assess the safety and efficacy of these compounds in human."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
