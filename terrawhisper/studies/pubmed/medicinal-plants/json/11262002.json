The molecular species of each glycolipid were separated and characterized by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with on-line mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The molecular species of steryl glucoside were beta-sitosteryl and campesteryl glucosides, and those of the acylated steryl glucoside were their fatty acid esters. The dilinolenoyl species was predominant in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol in addition to small amounts of another five molecular species, whereas digalactosyldiacylglycerol consisted of seven molecular species varying in their degree of unsaturation. The glucocerebroside class contained at least seven molecular species, which were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioprocessing, Faculty of Agriculture, Gifu University, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu City, Gifu 501-1193, Japan. yamautir@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamauchi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aizawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inakuma", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycolipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11262002", "10.1021/jf001192k", "jf001192k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
