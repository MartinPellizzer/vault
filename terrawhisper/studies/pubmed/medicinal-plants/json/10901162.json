The methanolic extract from Artemisia asiatica among tested 42 tea plants, showed the highest inhibitory effect (48%) on acetylcholinesterase in vitro. The methanolic extract was further separated with n-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate of water, in order. The chloroform solubles, which were high in inhibitory effect of acetylcholinesterase, were repeatedly subjected to open column chromatography on silica gel. From the highest inhibitory fraction (78%) on acetylcholinesterase, the single compound was obtained by the Sep-Pak Cartridge (C18: reverse phase column). This compound was found to react positively on Dragendorff's reagent (potassium bismuth iodide), which typically reacted with the alkaloid. This compound was purified by HPLC (mu-bondapack C18 reverse phase column: 3.9 x 150 mm). The IC50 (the concentration of 50% enzyme inhibition) value of this compound was 23 micrograms/ml and the inhibitory pattern on acetylcholinesterase was mixed with competitive/non-competitive type. We examined the effects of this compound on toxicity induced by A beta (25-35) in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Pretreatment of the PC12 cells for 2 h with an alkaloid of Artemisia asiatica (1200 microg/ml) reduced the toxicity induced by A beta. This study demonstrated that an alkaloid of Artemisia asiatica, which was metabolized to small molecule in digestive tract and then could pass through the blood-brain barrier, appeared to be an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with a blocker of neurotoxicity induced by A beta in human brain causing Alzheimer's disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cells", "NlmUniqueID": "9610936", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8478"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formazans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "amyloid beta-protein (25-35)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "23305-68-2", "NameOfSubstance": "MTT formazan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4VX7YNB537", "NameOfSubstance": "Tacrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Exocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Formazans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tacrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazolium Salts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10901162", "S1016-8478(23)17472-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
