Administration of Biophytum sensitivum significantly enhanced the proliferation of splenocytes, thymocytes and bone marrow cells by stimulating the mitogenic potential of various mitogens such as Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Concanavalin A (Con A), Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and Poke Weed Mitogen (PWM). Natural killer (NK) cell activity was enhanced significantly by Biophytum sensitivum in both the normal (43.6% cell lysis on day 5) and the tumor bearing group (48.2% cell lysis on day 5), and it was found to be earlier than tumor bearing control animals (maximum of 13.4% cell lysis on day 9). Antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was also enhanced significantly in both Biophytum treated normal (35% cell lysis on day 7) as well as tumor bearing animals (40.2% cell lysis on day 7) compared to untreated control tumor bearing animals (maximum of 12.3% cell lysis on day 11). An early antibody dependent complement mediated cytotoxicity (ACC) was also observed in the Biophytum treated normal (22.6% cell lysis, on day 15) and tumor bearing animals (26.4% cell lysis, on day 15). Results of our present study suggest the immunomodulatory property of Biophytum sensitivum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Amala Cancer Research Centre, Thrissur, Kerala State, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guruvayoorappan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuttan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-36-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement System Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Complement System Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18075848", "10.1080/08923970701606163", "788422181"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
