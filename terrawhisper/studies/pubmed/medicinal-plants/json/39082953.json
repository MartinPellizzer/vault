Limited therapeutic efficiency and serious side effects greatly restrict the clinical performance of chemotherapeutic drugs. The development of smart nanomedicines has provided new research directions, to some extent. However, the involvement of complex carrier compositions inevitably brings biosafety concerns and greatly limits the \"bench-to-bed\" translation of most nanomedicines reported. In this study, a carrier-free self-assembled prodrug was fabricated by two triterpenes (glycyrrhetinic acid, GA and ginsenoside Rh2, Rh2) isolated from medicinal plants, licorice, and ginseng, for the targeted and highly effective treatment of OSCC. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) self-supplied molecule TK-GA<sub>2</sub> was synthesized with ROS-responsive thioketal linker and prodrug was prepared by a rapid-solvent-exchange method with TK-GA<sub>2</sub> and Rh2. After administration, oral tumor cells transported large amounts of prodrugs with glucose ligands competitively. Endogenous ROS in oral tumor cells then promoted the release of GA and Rh2. GA further evoked the generation of a large number of ROS to help self-boosted drug release and increase oxidative stress, synergistically causing tumor cell apoptosis with Rh2. Overall, this carrier-free triterpene-based prodrug might provide a preeminent opinion on the design of effective chemotherapeutics with low systemic toxicity against OSCC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0147-9781"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Peptide and Small Molecular Drugs, Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education of China, Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Peptide and Small Molecular Drugs, Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education of China, Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Guantong", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Jinhai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Zhuo-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Nanoscience and Technology, Beijing 100190, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhongxian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen DK-2100, Denmark."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fuxue", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Peptide and Small Molecular Drugs, Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education of China, Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Peijian", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Peptide and Small Molecular Drugs, Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education of China, Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuji", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7503-6310"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Peptide and Small Molecular Drugs, Engineering Research Center of Ministry of Education of China, Beijing Laboratory of Biomedical Materials, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Xinmiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7143-3370"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR 999077, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Yu-Xiong", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39082953", "10.1021/acsami.4c10175"]}}]}
