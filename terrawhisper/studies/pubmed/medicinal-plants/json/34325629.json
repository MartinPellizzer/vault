The prevalence of obesity has elevated over the years, and it has become a global health problem. The drugs presently used for managing obesity have several side effects, such as diarrhea, leakage of oily stools, etc. On the contrary, herbal plants and natural products are considered safe for use because they have lesser side effects. New compounds isolated from medicinal plants are screened and identified to determine their effectiveness and potential in preventing abnormal weight gain. In this review, the medicinal plants and natural materials are surveyed across the literature to cover those that have the potential for managing and controlling weight gain. Furthermore, their mechanism of action, active components, and experimental methodologies are also reviewed. These herbal products can be developed as formulations for therapeutic use in obesity. The herbal plants mentioned in the review are classified based on their mechanism of action, inhibition of pancreatic lipase, and appetite suppression activities. The ability to inhibit pancreatic lipase enzyme has been used to determine the effectiveness of herbal products for the prevention of abnormal weight gain because of its action on dietary fat and suppression of appetite. This review is an attempt to summarize the herbal plants and natural products that can be used to develop formulations effective in controlling weight gain and obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Noida, UP 201303, India."}], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "Harsha", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Noida, UP 201303, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Meenakshi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Noida, UP 201303, India."}], "LastName": "Walia", "ForeName": "Ramanpreet", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al-Balqa' Applied University, Salt, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Khataibeh", "ForeName": "Moayad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Noida, UP 201303, India."}], "LastName": "Sarwat", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34325629", "10.2174/1389200222666210729114456", "CDM-EPUB-116958"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
