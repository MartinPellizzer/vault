Nanotechnology has provided a promising approach for research and development of new larvicides. Larvicidal potential of a nanoemulsion of <i>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</i> essential oil reports against <i>Anopheles stephensi</i>.", "The nanoemulsion of was formulated in various ratios comprising of <i>C. zeylanicum</i> oil, tween 80, span 20 and water by stirrer. It was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). All components of <i>C. zeylanicum</i> essential oil were identified by GC-MS analysis. The larvicidal potential of the oil and its nanoformulation were evaluated against larvae of <i>An. stephensi</i>. The stability and durability of nanoemulsion was observed over a period of time.", "Sixty one components in the oil were identified, cinnamaldehyde (56.803%) was the main component. The LC<sub>90</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> values of <i>C. zeylanicum</i> essential oil were calculated as 49\u00a0ppm and 37\u00a0ppm, respectively. The nanoemulsion droplets were found spherical in shape. It was able to kill 100% of larvae in up to 3\u00a0days. It was stable after dilution and increased its larvicidal activity up to 32% compared with the essential oil.", "A novel larvicide based on nanotechnology introduced. This experiment clearly showed increasing larvicidal activity and residual effect of the nanoformulation in comparison with the bulk essential oil. It could be concluded that this nanoemulsion may be considered as safe larvicide and should be subject of more research in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411705.6", "0000 0001 0166 0922"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Control, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.412763.5", "0000 0004 0442 8645"], "Affiliation": "Urmia Health Center, Disease Control Unit, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Firooziyan", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.464653.6", "0000 0004 0459 3173"], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["grid.411705.6", "0000 0001 0166 0922"], "Affiliation": "Medical Biomaterials Research Center (MBRC), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amani", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411135.3", "0000 0004 0415 3047"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran."}], "LastName": "Osanloo", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411705.6", "0000 0001 0166 0922"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Control, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moosa-Kazemi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hasan", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411705.6", "0000 0001 0166 0922"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Control, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Basseri", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.412763.5", "0000 0004 0442 8645"], "Affiliation": "Medical Parasitology Department, School of Medicine, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hajipirloo", "ForeName": "Habib Mohammadzadeh", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.412763.5", "0000 0004 0442 8645"], "Affiliation": "Urmia Health Center, Disease Control Unit, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadaghianifar", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411705.6", "0000 0001 0166 0922"], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Vector Control, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sedaghat", "ForeName": "Mohammad Mehdi", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Health Sci Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101613643"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "WHO.
