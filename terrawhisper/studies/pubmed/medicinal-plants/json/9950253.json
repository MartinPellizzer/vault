Positive p53 stain was observed in 47 of 81 (58%) cases of oral SCC. p53 overexpression was found to be higher in patients without AQ chewing and smoking habits than in patients with these two habits (80% vs 52%, P=0.076). No significant correlation was found between p53 expression and the patients' age, sex, cancer location, clinical staging, primary tumor TNM status, or histological differentiation of SCC. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the prognosis for patients with p53-negative tumors was significantly better than that for patients with p53-positive tumors (P<0.05). A significant correlation was also observed between positive lymph node status and poor prognosis (P<0.05). These results suggest that p53 may serve as an adjuvant marker of poor survival in patients with oral SCCs in Taiwan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "B Y", "Initials": "BY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hahn", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "M Y", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "mortality", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "mortality", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Staging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prognosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9950253", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1999.tb01999.x"]}}]}
