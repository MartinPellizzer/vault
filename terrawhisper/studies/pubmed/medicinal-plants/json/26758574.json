This study aimed to determine the effect of herbal treatment on BP, endothelial function and anthropometric measures in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This clinical trial included 204 T2DM patients randomly assigned to four intervention groups receiving 3 g cinnamon, 3 g cardamom, 1 g saffron or 3 g ginger with three glasses of black tea, and one control group consuming only three glasses of tea without any herbals, for 8 weeks. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), systolic and diastolic BP and anthropometric measures were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks. No significant difference was found between various medicinal plants in terms of influencing BP, serum soluble (s)ICAM-1 concentrations and anthropometric measures. However, in within-group comparison saffron and ginger intakes significantly reduced sICAM-1 concentrations (340.9\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4 vs 339.69\u2009\u00b1\u200914.4 ng/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.01, and 391.78\u2009\u00b1\u200916.0 vs 390.97\u2009\u00b1\u200915.8 ng/ml, p\u2009=\u20090.009, respectively) and ginger intake affected systolic BP (143.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 vs 142.07\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u2009mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.02). Although administration of these herbal medicines as supplementary remedies could affect BP and sICAM-1 concentrations, there was no significant difference between the plants in terms of influencing anthropometric measures, BP and endothelial function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Security Research Center ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Community Nutrition , School of Nutrition and Food Science ;"}], "LastName": "Azimi", "ForeName": "Paria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Security Research Center ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Community Nutrition , School of Nutrition and Food Science ;"}], "LastName": "Ghiasvand", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Health , Isfahan University of Medical Science , Isfahan , Iran ;"}], "LastName": "Feizi", "ForeName": "Awat", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Security Research Center ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Community Nutrition , School of Nutrition and Food Science ;"}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Security Research Center ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Community Nutrition , School of Nutrition and Food Science ;"}], "LastName": "Bahreynian", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Food Security Research Center ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Community Nutrition , School of Nutrition and Food Science ;"}], "LastName": "Hariri", "ForeName": "Mitra", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Populations and Social Health Research Program, Menzies Health Institute Queensland and School of Medicine , Griffith University , Australia."}], "LastName": "Khosravi-Boroujeni", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Blood Press", "NlmUniqueID": "9301454", "ISSNLinking": "0803-7051"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure Determination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crocus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Elettaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26758574", "10.3109/08037051.2015.1111020"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
