They consist of an interactive network with PTPN11 and FN1, which involved in IL-35-related JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Besides, urinary LAIR1 was significantly correlated with JSLE-LN clinical parameters such as SLEDAI-2K, %CD19+ B, and %CD3+ T cells. Through bioinformatics analysis of co-immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry results, including GO, KEGG, and STRING, five genes interacted with Lair1 were upregulated by IL-35, but only Myh10 was downregulated. Therefore, we presumed an interactive network among these DEPs, JAK/STAT, and IL-35. Moreover, the downregulated phosphorylated (p)-STAT3, p-p38 MAPK, and p-ERK, and the upregulated p-JAK2/p-STAT1/4 in IL-35 overexpressed mesangial cells, and RNA-sequencing results validated the potential regulatory mechanisms of IL-35 in alleviating JSLE-LN disease. Moreover, the relieved histopathological features of nephritis including urine protein and leukocyte scores, a decreased %CD90<sup>+</sup> \u03b1SMA<sup>+</sup> mesangial cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, the inactivated JAK/STAT signals and the significant upregulated Tregs in spleen, thymus and peripheral blood were validated in Tregs and IL-35 overexpression plasmid-treated lupus mice.", "Our study provided a reference proteomic map of urinary biomarkers for JSLE-LN and elucidated evidence that IL-35 may regulate the interactive network of LAIR1-PTPN11-JAK-STAT-FN1 to affect JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling pathways to alleviate inflammation in JSLE-LN. This finding may provide a further prospective mechanism for JSLE-LN clinical treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Authors.
