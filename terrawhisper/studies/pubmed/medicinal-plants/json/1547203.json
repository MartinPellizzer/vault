The amounts of freeze-dried extracts recovered were 74, 89 and 97 g/kg hull for the varieties Brunette, Statissa and Minica respectively. Chicks (3 weeks old) were fed on a maize-soya-bean control diet or the same control diet substituted with either 30 g proanthocyanidin extracts/kg or 300 g proanthocyanidin-rich hulls/kg. Chicks were tube-fed diets twice daily for 4 d. Nutrient digestibilities were calculated from amounts present in diets and freeze-dried excreta with the aid of titanium dioxide as a marker. Enzyme activities were measured in digesta removed from the jejunum. Extracts of proanthocyanidins depressed the digestibility of protein by 34%, starch by 3% and had no effect on the digestibility of lipid. Proanthocyanidin-rich hulls depressed the digestibility of protein by 62%, starch by 6% and lipid by 4%. Digestive enzyme activities were depressed to the same extent by extracts and hulls, trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) by 55 and 62%, alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) by 75 and 78% and lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) by 31 and 32% for proanthocyanidin-extract and proanthocyanidin-rich-hull diets respectively. The susceptibility of substrates as well as enzymes to the effects of proanthocyanidins is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Alimentacion Animal, Ciudad Universitaria, Madrid, Spain."}], "LastName": "Yuste", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Longstaff", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McCorquodale", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18206-61-6", "NameOfSubstance": "proanthocyanidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proanthocyanidins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Amylases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1547203", "10.1079/bjn19920008", "S0007114592000096"]}}]}
