Many <i>Viola</i> species are used as medicinal herbs across Asia and are often consumed by humans in teas for the treatment of diseases, including ulcers and asthma. Previous studies reported the isolation of cyclotides from <i>Viola</i> species in many countries in the hope of discovering novel compounds with anti-cancer activities; however, <i>Viola</i> species from Vietnam have not been investigated to date. Here, the discovery of cyclotides from three <i>Viola</i> species (<i>V. arcuata</i>, <i>V. tonkinensis</i>, and <i>V. austrosinensis</i>) collected in the northern mountainous region of Vietnam is reported. Ten cyclotides were isolated from these three <i>Viola</i> species: four are novel and six were previously reported to be expressed in other plants. The structures of three of the new bracelet cyclotides are similar to that of cycloviolacin O2. Because cycloviolacin O2 has previously been shown to have potent activity against a wide range of cancer cell lines including HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) and PC-3 (human prostate cancer cells), the cancer cytotoxicity of the cyclotides isolated from <i>V. arcuata</i> was assessed. All tested cyclotides were cytotoxic against cancer cells, albeit to varying degrees. The sequences discovered in this study significantly expand the understanding of cyclotide diversity, especially in comparison with other cyclotides found in plants from the Asian region."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Dang", "ForeName": "Tien T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9346-2487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Lai Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6937-2660"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yen-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Linh T T", "Initials": "LTT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9988-6152"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kaas", "ForeName": "Quentin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6870-6040"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences and Food Technology, RMIT University, Victoria 3001, Australia."}], "LastName": "Huynh", "ForeName": "Tien", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0007-6796"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Innovations in Peptide and Protein Science, Institute for Molecular Bioscience, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia."}], "LastName": "Craik", "ForeName": "David J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IHB9R8ET7W", "NameOfSubstance": "cycloviolacin O2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclotides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Viola"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32437150", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b01218"]}}]}
