Recent studies have shown that plant-derived molecules may be used in targeting different signaling pathways for cancer drug discovery. The present paper gives an insight into the anticancer potential of fenugreek and lists the existing studies that have been carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the use of fenugreek in cancer treatment and prevention. It also aims at opening up new perspectives in the development of new drugs of natural origins in the future clinical trials. This review article will discuss; (1) the chemical constituents and bioactive compounds of fenugreek; (2) effects on oxidative stress and inflammation; (3) effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion; (4) toxicity of fenugreek; and 5) future directions in cancer drug development. All of the experimental studies discussed in this paper suggest that multiple signaling pathways (hallmarks) are involved in the anticancer activities of fenugreek, but their efficacy is still unclear, which requires further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
