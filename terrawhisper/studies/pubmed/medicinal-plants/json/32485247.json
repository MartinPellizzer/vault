The biomolecular functionalization not only stabilizes the ferrite nanoparticles from agglomeration but also provides an environment for the biogenic reduction of Pd<sup>2+</sup> ions. This protocol is a promising breakthrough for the synthesis of a quasi-heterogeneous catalyst, a bridge between heterogeneous and homogeneous medium. The structure, morphology and physicochemical properties of the material were characterized utilizing various analytical techniques like FT-IR, FE-SEM, TEM, VSM, EDX-elemental mapping, ICP, EDX and XPS. The catalyst showed excellent reactivity in C-C and C-N cross coupling reactions via Suzuki and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions respectively. An array of different biphenyls and aryl amines were then procured by reactions of various aryl halides with phenylboronic acid or secondary amines over the catalyst affording good to excellent yields. The catalyst was easily recoverable using an external magnet and thereafter recycled for several trials with insignificant palladium leaching or loss in catalytic performance. To investigate the cardiovascular protective activities of catalyst, the MTT assay was done on Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAEC), Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC), and Human Pulmonary Artery Endothelial Cells (HPAEC) cell lines. Nanocatalyst-treated cell cutlers significantly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) decreased the caspase-3 activity, and DNA fragmentation. It raised the cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential in the high concentration of Mitoxantrone-treated HAEC, HCAEC, and HPAEC cells. According to the above findings, nanocatalyst can be administrated as a cardiovascular protective drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases after approving in the clinical trial studies in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
