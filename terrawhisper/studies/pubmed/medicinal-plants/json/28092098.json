In the present study, the authors have reviewed all important literature about the ethnopharmacological investigations on medicinal plants used in the last decade in Iran. All provinces of Iran were categorized according to a phytogeographical division. Information was collected through bibliographic investigations from scientific journals and books. Afterward, the data were analyzed through the construction of specific ecological regions of the country. Fifty-five references reporting medicinal plants in five ecological zones were retrieved. The Irano-Turanian subregion has produced the greatest number of publications in this field among others (47%). Results illustrate that the most reported botanical families were Lamiaceae and Asteraceae (28.57% and 27.73%, respectively). Among various illnesses reported for these plants, gastrointestinal (30.15%), respiratory problems (14.28%), diabetes (11.11%), and cold/flu (11.11%) were the most cited. The most frequently cited medicinal uses were attributed to decoction and infusion preparations. Iran has a rich history of knowledge about phytotherapy and has also a diverse geographical regions, and a plant flora that is a good candidate for drug discovery. Documentation of indigenous knowledge about herbal medicine used by Iranian tribes is vital for the future development of herbal drugs. Ethnopharmacological studies of Iranian folk medicine with quantitative analytical techniques are warranted to find drug candidates, and also to preserve the precious knowledge of the Iranian folk medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Traditional Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akaberi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agricultural and Natural Resources, Department of Production and Utilization of Medicinal Plants, Higher Educational Complex of Saravan, Saravan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sobhkhizi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8656-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Traditional Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Emami", "ForeName": "Seyed Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cultural Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28092098", "10.1002/jcp.25803"]}}]}
