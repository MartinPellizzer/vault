Our previous studies have demonstrated that beta-elemene exhibits strong inhibitory activity in ovarian cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of beta-elemene on prostate cancer cells as well as other types of tumour cells and to determine whether the effect of beta-elemene on prostate cancer cell death was mediated through the induction of apoptosis.", "The MTT assay was used to evaluate the ability of beta-elemene to inhibit cellular proliferation in cancer cells. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by annexin V binding, TUNEL and ELISA-based assays. Caspase activity was measured using a caspases assay kit. The protein levels of Bcl-2, caspases, cytochrome c and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were analysed by Western blotting.", "Here, we showed that beta-elemene had an antiproliferative effect on androgen-insensitive prostate carcinoma DU145 and PC-3 cells. Treatment with beta-elemene also inhibited the growth of brain, breast, cervical, colon and lung carcinoma cells. The effect of beta-elemene on cancer cells was dose dependent, with IC50 values ranging from 47 to 95 microg/ml (230-465 microm). TUNEL assay and flow cytometric analysis using annxin V/propidium iodide staining revealed that the percentage of apoptotic prostate cancer cells was increased by beta-elemene in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, beta-elemene exposure resulted in a decreased Bcl-2 protein level, increased cytochrome c release, and activated PARP and caspase-3, -7, -9, and -10 in prostate cancer cells.", "Overall, these findings suggest that beta-elemene exerts broad-spectrum antitumour activity against many types of solid carcinoma and supports a proposal of beta-elemene as a new potentially therapeutic drug for castration-resistant prostate cancer and other solid tumours."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA. liquenti@niaid.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qingdi Quentin", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Gangduo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Furong", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banda", "ForeName": "Malathi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reed", "ForeName": "Eddie", "Initials": "E"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P20RR016440-010003", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P20RR016440-020003", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "P20RR016440-040003", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Annexin A5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-elemene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.2.30", "NameOfSubstance": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Annexin A5"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Situ Nick-End Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20663036", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.2010.01135.x", "JPHP1135"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
