Twenty-four were managed with CA (Centellicum\u00ae: 3 capsules/day: 675 mg/day) in association with SM, and 26 subjects were managed with Pycnogenol\u00ae (150 mg/day) + CA (Centellicum\u00ae at the same dosage as in group 2) and SM.", "Subjects in the 3 groups were comparable, including the distribution of plaques. The occurrence of any previous catheterizations was also comparable. Safety and tolerability were optimal, no subjects had to stop supplementation. The percentage of subjects with improved symptoms evaluated with a Visual Analogue Scale line was significantly higher with both supplements in comparison with SM (P<0.05). The combined management with Pycnogenol\u00ae and Centellicum\u00ae was superior to the other 2 managements (P<0.05). Erectile function assessed by the Index of Erectile Fuction questionnaire (IIEF) was significantly higher with the combination Pycnogenol\u00ae+Centellicum (P<0.05). The number of plaques and microplaques, the average total sectional area of the plaques in each subject and the grey scale median were all better improved with the combination. Both supplementations were superior to SM at 12 weeks (P<0.05). Oxidative stress resulted significantly better (P<0.05) with the combination. All blood tests were normal at inclusion and at 12 weeks. The minimal, penile curvature at baseline was reduced in both the supplement groups at 12 weeks more than in the SM group (P<0.05).", "In conclusion Centellicum and Pycnogenol\u00ae appear to improve penile fibrosis reducing the keloidal aspects of penile plaques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ledda", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cornelli", "ForeName": "Umberto", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy - cardres@abol.it."}], "LastName": "Belcaro", "ForeName": "Gianni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Dugall", "ForeName": "Mark", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Feragalli", "ForeName": "Beatrice", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cotellese", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Irvine3 Labs and IAPSS (International Agency For Pharma Standard Supplements), University of Chieti-Pescara, Pescara, Italy."}], "LastName": "Corsi", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Observational Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Panminerva Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0421110", "ISSNLinking": "0031-0808"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50JZ5Z98QY", "NameOfSubstance": "pycnogenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catheterization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Elasticity Imaging Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erectile Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Penile Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Penis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Registries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Visual Analog Scale"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32199407", "10.23736/S0031-0808.18.03572-3", "S0031-0808.18.03572-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
