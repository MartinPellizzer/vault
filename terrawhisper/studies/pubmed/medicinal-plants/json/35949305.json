Mice were pretreated once daily for 3 days as follows: (1) the control group was pretreated with oral administration (o.p.) of saline solution, followed by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of saline solution. The other groups were pretreated (o.p.) with (2) saline solution (cisplatin group), (3) <i>N-</i>acetylcysteine (positive control), with (4) 50, or (5) 200 mg/kg body weight of <i>A. cearensis</i> extract, followed by injection of 5 mg/kg body weight (IP) of cisplatin. The ovaries were harvested and destined for histological (follicular morphology), immunohistochemistry (apoptosis and cell proliferation), and fluorescence (reactive oxygen species [ROS], glutathione concentrations [GSH], and active mitochondria) analyses. Furthermore, immunoexpression of p-PTEN and p-Akt was evaluated to elucidate a potential mechanism by which <i>A. cearensis</i> extract could prevent cisplatin-induced ovarian damage.", "After HPLC analysis, protocatechuic acid was detected in the extract. The pretreatment with <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine or <i>A. cearensis</i> extract maintained the percentage of normal follicles and cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis and ROS concentrations, and increased GSH concentrations and mitochondrial activity compared with cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, pretreatment with <i>A. cearensis</i> extract regulated p-PTEN and p-Akt immunoexpression after cisplatin exposure.", "Pretreatment with <i>A. cearensis</i> extract prevented cisplatin-induced ovarian damage through its anti-oxidant actions and by modulating the expression of phosphorylated PTEN and Akt proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gouveia", "ForeName": "Bruna B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barberino", "ForeName": "Ric\u00e1ssio S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Menezes", "ForeName": "Van\u00fazia G", "Initials": "VG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Monte", "ForeName": "Alane P O", "Initials": "APO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Regina Lucia S", "Initials": "RLS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Pharmacology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Palheta", "ForeName": "Raimundo C", "Initials": "RC", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Drug, Medicament and Food Analysis, Department of Pharmacy, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Rolim", "ForeName": "Larissa A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Drug, Medicament and Food Analysis, Department of Pharmacy, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "Emanuella C V", "Initials": "ECV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Studies and Research of Medicinal Plants, Department of Pharmacy, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Raimundo G", "Initials": "RG", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Studies and Research of Medicinal Plants, Department of Pharmacy, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "Jackson Roberto G S", "Initials": "JRGS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nucleus of Biotechnology Applied to Ovarian Follicle Development, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of S\u00e3o Francisco Valley, Petrolina, Pernambuco, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Matos", "ForeName": "Maria Helena T", "Initials": "MHT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Basic Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101517966", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3866"}, "CoiStatement": "None of the authors has any conflicts of interest to declare."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Silveira ZS, Mac\u00eado NS, Bezerra SR, Siyadatpanah A, Coutinho HDM, Seifi Z, et al.
