The degradation of total nitrogen in nylon bags of the feeds was measured between 0 and 48 h in the rumen of 2 cows (theoretical degradability: 70.0% for soybean meal and 94.7% for field pea). Electrophoresis of proteins of feeds and in situ residues, in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) showed that both species have the same type of proteins (7S and 11S) which were degraded in a similar manner in the rumen. The 7S fraction was degraded rapidly whereas the 11S fraction was more resistant. The electrophoretic profiles showed that protein components were less degraded after enzymatic than in situ degradation. In the supernatant after enzymatic hydrolysis, protein and peptides were found in large concentrations and alpha-amino nitrogen and ammonia in low concentrations. It was difficult to simulate the in vitro activity of enzyme complexes in the rumen and the results must be confirmed by direct measurement of the rumen liquid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRA-Theix, Station de Recherches sur la Nutrition des Herbivores, Unit\u00e9 Valeur Alimentaire, Saint-Gen\u00e8s-Champanelle, France."}], "LastName": "Aufr\u00e8re", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Graviou", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michalet-Doreau", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Nutr Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "8913069", "ISSNLinking": "0926-5287"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Endopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptomyces griseus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7802940", "10.1051/rnd:19940509"]}}]}
