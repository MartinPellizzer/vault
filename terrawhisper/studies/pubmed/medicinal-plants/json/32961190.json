This has encouraged us to design and synthesis of a novel Au NPs immobilized pectin modified magnetic nanoparticles (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Pectin/Au). It was meticulously characterized using advanced analytical techniques like FT-IR, FESEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, VSM, XRD and ICP-OES. We investigated the chemical applications of the material in the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes using N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O as the reducing agent in the EtOH/H<sub>2</sub>O solvent without any promoters or ligands. Due to strong paramagnetism, the catalyst was easily recovered and reused in 11\u00a0cycles without considerable leaching or loss in reactivity. The green protocol involves several advantages like mild conditions, easy workup, high yields, and reusability of the catalyst. Furthermore, the desired nanocomposite was employed in biological studies like anti-oxidant assay by DPPH radical scavenging test. Subsequently, on exhibiting a good IC<sub>50</sub> value in the DPPH assay, we extended the bio-application of the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Pectin/Au in the anticancer study of adenocarcinoma cells of human lungs using three cancer cell lines, PC-14, LC-2/ad and HLC-1 and a normal cell line HUVEC. The best result was accomplished in PC-14 cell lines with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> values."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
