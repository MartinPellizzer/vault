Lupin protein was consumed at levels of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 g/(kg.d) and egg protein at 0.3, 0.45 and 0.6 g/(kg.d). Each period started with 1 d of consuming a protein-free diet; the next 6 d were used as adaptation and the last 4 d for balance. The levels of protein intake were randomly assigned by a modified Latin square. Energy intake was individually adjusted. Mean apparent N digestibility values of lupin protein were 78.8, 76.1 and 70.2% for the levels of 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 g protein(kg.d), respectively, and 83.8, 78.3 and 67.1% for egg protein consumed at levels of 0.6, 0.45 and 0.3 g protein/(kg.d), respectively. The N balance results obtained when subjects consumed lupin were 16.4, 0.2 and -15.1 mg N/(kg.d) for protein intakes of 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 g/(kg.d), respectively. Those obtained for egg consumption were 12.6, -3.6 and -17.1 mg N/(kg.d) for protein intakes of 0.6, 0.45 and 0.3 g/(kg.d), respectively. The linear regressions of intake and absorbed N to retained N for lupin were: N retained = -43.41 + 0.50 N intake and N retained = -36.30 + 0.53 N absorbed. The corresponding regressions for egg were: N retained = -45.0 + 0.65 N intake and N retained = -30.65 + 0.58 N absorbed. The net protein utilization of lupin was 77% that of egg protein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Nutrici\u00f3n y Tecnolog\u00eda de los Alimentos, Universidad de Chile, Santiago."}], "LastName": "Ega\u00f1a", "ForeName": "J I", "Initials": "JI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uauy", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cassorla", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barrera", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ya\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Egg Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Egg Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1453217", "10.1093/jn/122.12.2341"]}}]}
