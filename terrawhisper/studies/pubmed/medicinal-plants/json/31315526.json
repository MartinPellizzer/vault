Under oxygen saturation, sickle hemoglobin form polymers, leading to rigid erythrocytes. The transition of the blood vessels is altered and initiated by the adhesion of erythrocytes, neutrophils and endothelial cells. Sickle Hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization is a major cause in red blood cells (RBC), promoting sickling and destruction of RBCs. Isoquercitrin, a medicinal bioactive compound found in various medicinal plants, has multiple health benefits. The present study examines the potential of isoquercitrin as an anti-sickle agent, showing a significant decrease in the rate of polymerization as well as sickling of RBCs. Isoquercitrin-induced graded alteration in absorbance and fluorescence of HbS, confirmed their interaction. A negative value of \u0394<i>G</i>\u00b0 strongly suggests that it is a spontaneous exothermic reaction induced by entropy. Negative \u0394<i>H</i>\u00b0 and positive \u0394<i>S</i>\u00b0 predicted that hydrogen and hydrophobic binding forces interfered with a hydrophobic microenvironment of \u03b26Val leading to polymerization inhibition of HbS. HbS-Isoquercitrin complex exhibits helical structural changes leading to destabilization of the HbS polymer as confirmed by CD spectroscopy. MST and DSC results indicate greater changes in thermophoretic mobility and thermal stability of sickle hemoglobin in the presence of isoquercitrin, respectively. These findings were also supported by molecular simulation studies using DOCK6 and GROMACS. Hence, we can conclude that isoquercitrin interacts with HbS through hydrogen bonding, which leads to polymerization inhibition. Consequently, isoquercitrin could potentially be used as a medication for the treatment of sickle cell disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
