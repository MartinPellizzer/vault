Twenty weanling male Wistar rats were divided into two groups fed standard (STD) or high-fat diet (HFD) containing 10 and 31.6\u00a0% of total calories from fat, respectively, for 1\u00a0month. Serum lipid spectrum, apolipoproteins, glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels were assessed. The level of trace elements was estimated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. High-fat feeding significantly increased epidydimal (EDAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT), as well as total adipose tissue mass by 34, 103, and 59\u00a0%, respectively. Serum leptin levels in HFD animals were twofold higher than those in the control rats. No significant difference in serum lipid spectrum, apolipoproteins, glucose, adiponectin, and insulin was detected between the groups. HFD significantly altered tissue trace element content. In particular, HFD-fed animals were characterized by significantly lower levels of Cu, I, Mn, Se, and Zn in the liver; Cr, V, Co, Cu, Fe, and I content of EDAT; Co, Cu, I, Cr, V, Fe, and Zn concentration in RPAT samples. At the same time, only serum Cu was significantly depressed in HFD-fed animals as compared to the control ones. Hair Co, Mn, Si, and V levels were significantly increased in comparison to the control values, whereas Se and I content was decreased. HFD feeding induced excessive adiposity and altered tissue trace element content in rats without insulin resistance, adiponectin deficiency, and proatherogenic state. Hypothetically, trace element disbalance may precede obesity-associated metabolic disturbances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioelementology (Russian Satellite Centre of Trace Element - Institute for UNESCO), Orenburg State University, Pobedy Ave. 13, Orenburg, 460352, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Applied Bioelementology, Yaroslavl State University, Sovetskaya St., 14, Yaroslavl, 150000, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Tinkov", "ForeName": "Alexey A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Gatiatulina", "ForeName": "Eugenia R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Popova", "ForeName": "Elizaveta V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathologic Anatomy, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Polyakova", "ForeName": "Valentina S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Fundamental Medicine, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Lomonosovsky Prospekt, 31-5, Moscow, 117192, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalnaya", "ForeName": "Anastasia A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Research Laboratory, Bashkir State Medical University, Zaki Validi St., 64/2, Ufa, 450057, Russia."}], "LastName": "Agletdinov", "ForeName": "Eduard F", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioelementology (Russian Satellite Centre of Trace Element - Institute for UNESCO), Orenburg State University, Pobedy Ave. 13, Orenburg, 460352, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nikonorov", "ForeName": "Alexandr A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioelementology (Russian Satellite Centre of Trace Element - Institute for UNESCO), Orenburg State University, Pobedy Ave. 13, Orenburg, 460352, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Applied Bioelementology, Yaroslavl State University, Sovetskaya St., 14, Yaroslavl, 150000, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Grina St., 7, Moscow, 117216, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalny", "ForeName": "Anatoly V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epididymis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27311579", "10.1007/s12011-016-0777-1", "10.1007/s12011-016-0777-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
