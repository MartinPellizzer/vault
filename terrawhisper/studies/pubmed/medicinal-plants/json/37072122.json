The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the nephroprotective effects of crocin and nano-crocin against ZEA-induced toxicity in HEK293 cell line via modulation of oxidative stress and special formulation to make nano-crocin.", "Nano-crocin physicochemical properties, such as size, load, appearance, and drug release profile were determined. Also, the viability of intoxicated HEK293 cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase lipid Peroxidation (LPO), and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured.", "The best nano-crocin formulation with superior entrapment effectiveness (54.66 \u00b1 6.02), more significant drug loading (1.89 \u00b1 0.01), better zeta potential (-23.4 \u00b1 2.844), and smaller particle size (140.3 \u00b1 18.0\u00a0nm) was chosen. This study showed that treatment with crocin and nano-crocin in ZEA-induced cells, significantly decreased LDH and LPO levels and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) activities, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels compared to the control group. Moreover, nano-crocin had a more curative effect against oxidative stress than crocin.", "Niosomal structure of crocin, when administered with the special formulation, may be more beneficial in reducing ZEA-induced in vitro toxicity than conventional crocin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghafari", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghian", "ForeName": "Zohre", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oftadeh Harsin", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodabandelo", "ForeName": "Sodabe", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4564-3603"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["48430"], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5W827M159J", "NameOfSubstance": "Zearalenone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "877GWI46C2", "NameOfSubstance": "crocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HEK293 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Zearalenone"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37072122", "10.1177/09603271231169911"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
