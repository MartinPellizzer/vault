Aster\u00a0incisus extract (AIE) is the extract of a common plant that is mostly found in Asia. It has traditionally been used for medicinal purposes in South Korea. In this study, we evaluated the potential anticancer effects of a methanolic extract of Aster\u00a0incisus in a normal human cell line (HaCaT keratinocytes) and in 4\u00a0different types of human cancer cell lines (A549, lung cancer; Hep3B, liver cancer; MDA\u2011MB\u2011231, breast cancer; and AGS, gastric cancer). The HaCaT, A549, Hep3B, MDA\u2011MB\u2011231 and AGS cells were treated with various concentrations of AIE and following treatment, cell survival was evaluated. Additional analyses, such as WST-1 assay, western blot analysis, DAPI staining, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining and wound healing assay were performed to elucidate the mechanisms and pathways involved in the cell death induced by AIE. Treatment with AIE induced morphological changes and considerably reduced the viability of the both normal and cancer cell lines. Further analysis of the AGS gastric cancer cells revealed that AIE led to the induction of apoptosis and a high accumulation of cells in the G1 cell phase following treatment with AIE in a dose-dependent manner. The results also revealed that AIE successfully suppressed the migration of the AIE-treated AGS cells. The results of western blot analysis indicated that AIE increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, particularly Bid, Bad, Bak, cytochrome\u00a0c, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), cleaved caspase\u20113, -8 and -9 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Additionally, AIE decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that AIE induces apoptosis through the activation of the caspase\u2011dependent pathway mediated by the mitochondrial pathway and by arresting the cell cycle in AGS cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ngabire", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seong", "ForeName": "Yeong-Ae", "Initials": "YA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Maheshkumar Prakash", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Niyonizigiye", "ForeName": "Irvine", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Marine Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Yong Bae", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pukyong National University, Busan 45813, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gun-Do", "Initials": "GD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Int J Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9306042", "ISSNLinking": "1019-6439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aster Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Korean Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30226597", "10.3892/ijo.2018.4547"]}}]}
