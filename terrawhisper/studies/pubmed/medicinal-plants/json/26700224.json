Wistar rats were intraperitoneally treated with 37.5\u00a0mg/kg of EH and 10\u00a0mg/kg of EA for 9\u00a0days. Effects of EH and EA on antioxidant [glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutases (SOD)] and Phase II [NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs)] enzyme activities, as well as protein and mRNA expressions of those, were investigated. Polyphenolic content of EH was determined by LC-MS/MS analysis. EH and EA injection to rats resulted in a significant increase of NQO1 (3.6-fold and 4.7-fold), GPx (1.45-fold), and SOD (1.34-fold and 1.27-fold) enzyme activities, whereas total GST (46% and 57%) and its isoforms,and GST mu (57% and 72%), and GST theta (60% and 68%) activities were significantly decreased. Western-blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed that NQO1 and GPx protein and mRNA expressions were increased significantly (P < 0.0001), whereas GST mu and GST theta were significantly decreased (P < 0.0001)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Middle East Technical University, Department of Biological Sciences and Joint Graduate Program in Biochemistry, Ankara, Turkey, and Selcuk University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biochemistry , Konya , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karakurt", "ForeName": "Serdar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pamukkale University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology , Denizli , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Semiz", "ForeName": "Asli", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pamukkale University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology , Denizli , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Celik", "ForeName": "Gurbet", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Ankara University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Botany , Ankara , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Gencler-Ozkan", "ForeName": "Ayse Mine", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Pamukkale University, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Biology , Denizli , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Sen", "ForeName": "Alaattin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Middle East Technical University, Department of Biological Sciences and Joint Graduate Program in Biochemistry , Ankara , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Adali", "ForeName": "Orhan", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NQO1 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epilobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26700224", "10.1080/01635581.2016.1115092"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
