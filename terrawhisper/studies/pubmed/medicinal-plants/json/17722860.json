Due to severe problems associated with the continuous use of acaricides on animals, integrated tick management is recommended. Increasing public health concern over the tick-borne diseases demands the strategic control of ticks on animals that transmit diseases to human beings. Immunological control of tick vector of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) on cattle and other wild reservoir hosts is one of the possible alternative strategy for reducing the transmission of KFD to man. Chemical-vaccine synergies have been demonstrated and a combination of chemical and vaccine for tick and tick-borne disease control has been identified as a sustainable option. Studies have suggested the possibility of vaccine strategies directed towards both tick control and transmission of pathogens. Besides tick vaccine, use of endosymbionts, which are essential for the survival of arthropod hosts, for the control of tick vectors will be one of the targeted areas of research in near future. India with huge natural resources of herbs and other medicinal plants, the possibilities of developing herbal acaricides is discussed. The future of research directed towards target identification is exciting because of new and emerging technologies for gene discovery and vaccine formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Entomology Laboratory, Division of Parasitology, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar, India. sghoshp@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azhahianambi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Borne Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101212761", "ISSNLinking": "0972-9062"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaccines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Reservoirs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Tick Infestations"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Tick-Borne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ticks"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vaccines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "47"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17722860"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
