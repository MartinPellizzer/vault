Essential oils containing eugenol were extracted from buds of <i>Eugenia caryophyllata</i> commonly named clove using hydrodistillation. Afterwards, the analysis of the essential oils using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) shows that eugenol is the major constituent with 70.14% of it. The alkene group in eugenol was epoxidised using <i>m</i>-chloroperbenzoic acid leading to the synthesis of epoxide eugenol. The epoxide ring was cleaved to vanillyl glycol by mixed the epoxide eugenol with aluminum chloride hydrate in an ethanolic medium. A Density Functional Theory (DFT) study was investigated to understand the reactivity of the epoxide eugenol with the aluminum chloride hydrate. The results obtained from DFT based reactivity descriptors were in good agreement with the experiment results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9734-8024"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Abdou", "ForeName": "Achraf", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0435-1644"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Maaghloud", "ForeName": "Fatima Ezzahra", "Initials": "FE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7084-815X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Elmakssoudi", "ForeName": "Abdelhakim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0459-6935"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Aboulmouhajir", "ForeName": "Aziz", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-1477"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Jamal Eddine", "ForeName": "Jamal", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0929-7595"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Organic Synthesis, Extraction and Valorization, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Dakir", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3T8H1794QW", "NameOfSubstance": "Eugenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3CYT62D3GA", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Eugenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Syzygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36226769", "10.1080/14786419.2022.2132242"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
