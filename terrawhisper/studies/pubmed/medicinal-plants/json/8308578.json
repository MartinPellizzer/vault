The present study investigated the effect of tannins extracted from 'Mississippi Silver' cowpeas and black tea when incorporated into nutritionally balanced diets. Condensed tannins were incorporated into the diet of weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats at 0.0, 0.0057, 0.0171 and 0.057 g/100 g diet for 28 d. Ingestion of tannin from cowpeas or tea did not change significantly growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, apparent protein digestibility, nitrogen excretion, relative liver weight, or nitrogen concentration of liver. During d 11-18, apparent calcium absorption was lower in rats fed the medium and high levels of cowpea tannin and in those fed all levels of tea tannin compared with the control group. By wk 4, no differences were observed in apparent calcium absorption among treatment groups. Apparent magnesium absorption was not affected by dietary treatment, nor was femur content of calcium or magnesium. We conclude that at the levels of condensed tannins fed, a short-term reduction of apparent calcium absorption occurred; however, by wk 4 calcium absorption was comparable to that of the control group. The acute change that occurred in apparent calcium absorption did not influence bone calcium content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37901-1701."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bailey", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Collins", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8308578", "10.1093/jn/124.2.283"]}}]}
