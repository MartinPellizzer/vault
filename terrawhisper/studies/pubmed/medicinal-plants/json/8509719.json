The catabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL; d 1.019-1.063 g/ml) was studied in vivo and in vitro in the isolated perfused liver of rats fed either a casein or a bean diet. The clearance of LDL was significantly increased by 100% from 0.38 +/- 0.04 to 0.63 +/- 0.04 ml/h x 100 g body wt in vivo in the bean-fed rat. Similarly, the clearance of homologous and heterologous (human) LDL was also increased by 100% in the isolated perfused liver of bean-fed animals. Spleen, kidney, and hepatic cholesterogenesis was increased by 150% in these animals. Bile salt synthesis was increased from 1.54 +/- 0.02 to 2.84 +/- 0.09 nmol/min x g liver wt (P < 0.02) and biliary cholesterol output by 200% from 0.81 +/- 0.03 to 2.18 +/- 0.04 nmol/min x g (P < 0.02) in the isolated perfused liver of rats fed a bean diet. These results explained the depletion of hepatic cholesterol and were consistent with the LDL turnover studies, suggesting that apoB/E receptor activity was increased in these animals. ApoB and triglyceride secretion in the d < 1.060 g/ml lipoprotein fraction of liver perfusates remained normal in the bean-fed rats. In contrast, total sinusoidal cholesterol output isolated in the d < 1.060 g/ml fraction significantly decreased by 100% after 90 min of perfusion. Cholesterol output in the d > 1.060 g/ml lipoprotein fraction was unmodified by the bean diet. These data demonstrate that key metabolic pathways of hepatic cholesterol are modified in the bean-fed rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Gastroenterolog\u00eda, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Santiago."}], "LastName": "Marzolo", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amigo", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nervi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Lipid Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376606", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins E"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8509719", "S0022-2275(20)39701-7"]}}]}
