Extracts of the seven plants exhibiting significant inhibition of platelet function were reanalysed in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to remove polyphenolic tannins that precipitate proteins. Two of these extracts no longer exhibited inhibition of platelet activity after removal of tannins. However, extracts of Crataegus monogyna, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Eremophila freelingii, Eremophila longifolia, and Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa still potently inhibited ADP induced human platelet [14C]5-HT release in vitro, with levels ranging from 62 to 95% inhibition. I. pes-caprae, and C. monogyna also caused significant inhibition of ADP induced platelet aggregation. All of these plants have been previously used as traditional headache treatments, except for C. monogyna which is used primarily for protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Further studies elucidating the compounds that are responsible for these anti-platelet effects are needed to determine their exact mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genomics Research Centre and School of Health Science, Griffith University, PMB 50, GCMC, Gold Coast, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rogers", "ForeName": "K L", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grice", "ForeName": "I D", "Initials": "ID"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Griffiths", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9317982", "ISSNLinking": "0928-0987"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Headache"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Migraine Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10664475", "10.1016/s0928-0987(99)00074-3", "S0928098799000743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
