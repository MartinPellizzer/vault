Xanthoxyline (30 to 300 microM) inhibited contractions of the rat uterus, guinea-pig ileum, and urinary bladder induced by several agonists in a non-competitive, non-selective, concentration-related manner, with the IC50's ranging between 47 and 190 microM. Twitches evoked by electrical-stimulation of strips of guinea-pig longitudinal ileum, urinary bladder, dog ureter, and rat left atrium were also inhibited dose-dependently by cumulative additions of xanthoxyline (IC50's between 50 and 480 microM). Xanthoxyline was found to be a potent inhibitor of spontaneous contractions of the circular smooth muscle layer of the dog ureter, yielding an IC50 of 54 microM. Repeated washing of all preparations completely reversed the inhibitory effects of xanthoxyline. Therefore, it appears that xanthoxyline induces a direct and non-selective inhibition of contractions triggered by agonists or electrical stimulation of smooth and cardiac muscle preparations. The elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which xanthoxyline induced muscle relaxation requires further investigations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology (CCB), Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miguel", "ForeName": "O G", "Initials": "OG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rae", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z8RSY5TZPA", "NameOfSubstance": "xanthoxyline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetophenones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2356240", "10.1055/s-2006-960878"]}}]}
