Growth regulators at lower range (0.1-1.0 mg L(-1)) stimulated direct regeneration of shoots. Kinetin was superior to BAP and kinetin-IAA combination was more suitable than kinetin alone. About 15 shoots were yielded per explant after 30 days of culture in the medium containing kinetin and IAA both at 0.1mg L(-1). The cluster of proliferated shoots elongated and rooted simultaneously under the same treatment following another subculture, thus shortening the total time schedule of micropropagation. Shoot tips of regenerated shoots were continuously used to regenerate new shoots with periodic transfer to fresh medium resulting in a steady supply of normal, healthy plants without any deviation in the production rate during a continuous one year culture. Micropropagated plants were successfully established in soil with high survivality (80%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Bose Institute, Calcutta, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharyya", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11906118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
