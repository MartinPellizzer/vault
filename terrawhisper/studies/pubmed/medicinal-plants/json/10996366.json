The plants were vegetatively propagated and grown under three irradiances: full sunlight, partial (30% full sunlight), and deep shade (10% full sunlight) for 12-18 months. After 1 year of growth, five plants from each treatment were harvested to determine total above- and below ground dry mass. Four plants from the full sunlight and the partial shade treatments were harvested after 18 months to assess the soluble carbohydrate, organic acid and aloin concentrations of the clear parenchyma gel and the yellow leaf exudate, separately. Plants grown under full sunlight produced more numerous and larger axillary shoots, resulting in twice the total dry mass than those grown under partial shade. The dry mass of the plants grown under deep shade was 8.6% that of plants grown under full sunlight. Partial shade increased the number and length of leaves produced on the primary shoot, but leaf dry mass was still reduced to 66% of that in full sunlight. In contrast, partial and deep shade reduced root dry mass to 28 and 13%, respectively, of that under full sunlight, indicating that carbon allocation to roots was restricted under low light conditions. When plants were sampled 6 months later, there were only minor treatment effects on the concentration of soluble carbohydrates and aloin in the leaf exudate and gel. Soluble carbohydrate concentrations were greater in the gel than in the exudate, with glucose the most abundant soluble carbohydrate. Aloin was present only in the leaf exudate and higher irradiance did not induce a higher concentration. Limitation in light availability primarily affected total dry mass production and allocation, without substantial effects on either primary or secondary carbon metabolites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Ecofisiologia.
