Thus, searching for effective anti-ADV agents seems to be an urgent requirement. Many studies have shown that components derived from medicinal plants have antiviral activity. Therefore, the present study was aimed to evaluate in vitro anti-ADV activity and also antioxidant potential and total phenolic compounds of black tea (Camellia sinensis) crude extract. MethodsIn this study, the hydroalchoholic extract of black tea was prepared and its anti-ADV activity was evaluated on HEp2 cell line using MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] assay. The 50\u2006% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 50\u2006% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of the extract were determined using regression analysis. Its inhibitory effect on adsorption and/or post-adsorption stages of the virus replication cycle was evaluated. To determine antioxidant activity, total phenol content, and flavonoids content of the extract, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, Folin-Ciocalteu method, and aluminum chloride colorimetric method were used, respectively. ResultsThe CC50 and the IC50 of the extract were 165.95\u00b112.7 and 6.62\u00b11.4\u2006\u00b5g/mL, respectively, with the selectivity index (SI) of 25.06. This extract inhibited ADV replication in post-adsorption stage. The IC50 of DPPH radical was 8\u00b11.41\u2006\u03bcg/mL, compared with butylated hydroxytoluene, with IC50 of 25.41\u00b11.89\u2006\u03bcg/mL. The total phenol and flavonoid contents of the extract were 341.8\u00b14.41\u2006mg gallic acid equivalent per gram and 21.1\u00b12.11\u2006mg/g, respectively. ConclusionsHaving SI value of 25.06 with inhibitory effect on ADV replication, particularly during the post-adsorption period, black tea extract could be considered as a potential anti-ADV agent. The antiviral activity of this extract could be attributed to its phenolic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moradi", "ForeName": "Mohammad-Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alidadi", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adenoviridae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazolium Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27567600", "10.1515/jcim-2016-0050", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2016-0050/jcim-2016-0050.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
