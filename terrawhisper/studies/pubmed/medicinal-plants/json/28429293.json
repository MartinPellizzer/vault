FPCa-loaded spanlastics were prepared by thin film hydration (TFH) technique according to a full factorial design to investigate the influence of formulation variables on the drug entrapment efficiency (%EE), particle size (PS), deformability index (DI), and the % drug released after 24\u00a0h through the cellulose membrane (Q24h) using Design-Expert\u00ae software. The optimized formula (composed of Span 60 and Tween 60 as an edge activator at weight ratio of 8: 2 in presence of Transcutol P as a cosolvent in the hydration media) exhibited the highest %EE (49.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.60%), PS of 536.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.14\u00a0nm, DI of 5.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0g, and Q24h of 61.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.70%; it was also characterized for morphology and physical stability. In vitro release study of FPCa-loaded spanlastic gel and conventional FPCa gel through a synthetic membrane and hairless rat skin were evaluated. The skin permeation study revealed that spanlastic gel exhibited both consistent and prolonged action. Finally, the % inhibition of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema of spanlastic gel was three times higher than the conventional FPCa gel after 24\u00a0h. In conclusion, spanlastic-based gel could be a great approach for improving topical delivery of fenoprofen calcium, providing both prolonged and enhanced anti-inflammatory activity in the treatment of arthritis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, The Applied Research Center of Medicinal Plants \"ARCMP\", National Organization for Drug Control and Research \"NODCAR\", El-Mansouria Road, El-Haram, Giza, Egypt. dodi23121@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Farghaly", "ForeName": "Dalia Ali", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Kasr El-Aini St, Cairo, 11562, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Aboelwafa", "ForeName": "Ahmed A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, National Organization for Drug Control and Research \"NODCAR\", 51 Wezaret El-Zeraa St., Agouza, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hamza", "ForeName": "Manal Y", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Kasr El-Aini St, Cairo, 11562, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Magdy I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "AAPS PharmSciTech", "NlmUniqueID": "100960111", "ISSNLinking": "1530-9932"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RA33EAC7KY", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenoprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Liberation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Elasticity"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fenoprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28429293", "10.1208/s12249-017-0771-8", "10.1208/s12249-017-0771-8"]}}]}
