Subsequent enzymatic conversion of LTA (4) yields LTB (4) and the cysteinyl-LTs C (4), D (4) and E (4). LTs have prominent functions in pathophysiology and are connected to numerous disorders including bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, inflammatory bowel and skin diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Pharmacological and genetic interruption of the 5-LO pathway or blockade of LT receptors, serving as means for intervention with LTs, may be of therapeutic value for certain related disorders. Natural or plant-derived substances were among the first 5-LO inhibitors identified in the early 1980 s. To date, a huge number of diverse plant-derived compounds have been reported to interfere with 5-LO product synthesis. However, many investigations have addressed the efficacy of a given compound solely in cellular test systems and analysis of direct interference with 5-LO has been neglected. In the first part of this review, the biology and molecular pharmacology of the 5-LO pathway is summarized in order to understand its overall regulation and complexity as well as to comprehend the possible points of attack of compounds that eventually lead to inhibition of 5-LO product formation in intact cells. In the second part, natural compounds that interfere with 5-LO product formation are compiled and grouped into structural classes, and the underlying molecular mechanisms and structure-activity relationships are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analytics, Pharmaceutical Institute, Eberhard-Karls-University Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany. oliver.werz@uni-tuebingen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Werz", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukotrienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Leukotrienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}], "NumberOfReferences": "227"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17939102", "10.1055/s-2007-990242"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
