The material was found as an efficient sorbent for the enrichment of atorvastatin in human blood plasma. After the extraction of the sample of plasma by ultrasound-assisted dispersive solid phase extraction, high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet was used to determine the quantitatively pre-concentrated interest analyte. The conditions for optimum extraction were achieved by the optimization of the volume of eluent, dosage of the sorbent, and time of sonication. Solution pH of 7.0, 250 \u03bcL of ethanol, 45\u00a0mg of the sorbent, and 10\u00a0min of sonication time were the conditions for extracting the atorvastatin maximum recovery of higher than 97.0%. By using desirability function for the optimization of the process, the present method showed a response that was linear ranging from 0.2 to 800\u00a0ng/mL with regression coefficient of 0.999 in the plasma of human blood with a satisfactory detection limit of 0.05\u00a0ng/mL, while the precision of interday for the current method was found to be\u00a0<5%. It can be concluded that dispersive solid phase extraction method is effective for the extraction of atorvastatin from human plasma samples (97.4-102%) due to its easy operation, simplicity, repeatability, and reliability."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8316-6991"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrani", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9323-3505"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Yasouj University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaedi", "ForeName": "Mehrorang", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3759-8192"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asfaram", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2907-2596"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansoorkhani", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad Khoshnood", "Initials": "MJK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2776-9517"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Department of Chemical Engineering, ETSEIB, Diagonal 647, Barcelona, Spain."}], "LastName": "Javadian", "ForeName": "Hamedreza", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metal-Organic Frameworks"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A0JWA85V8F", "NameOfSubstance": "Atorvastatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LMI26O6933", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Atorvastatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal-Organic Frameworks"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonic Waves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Patel M, Kothari C, Critical review of statins: a bio-analytical perspective for therapeutic drug monitoring.
