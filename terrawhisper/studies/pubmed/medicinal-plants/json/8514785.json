Cytosolic ribosomes synthesize the small subunits as precursors, which enter the chloroplast, undergo proteolytic processing, and assemble with large subunits. Large subunits, synthesized in the chloroplast, first form a complex with the chloroplast chaperonin 60 (Cpn60(14)). In the presence of ATP, large subunits dissociate from Cpn60(14) and assemble into Rubisco. We now describe partial characterization of a new species, Z, containing radiotracer-labeled, newly synthesized pea Rubisco large subunits. Rubisco assembly occurs in low salt in the presence of small subunits and ATP. As with Rubisco assembly, the formation of Z is ATP-dependent and is inhibited by high chloride. Once formed, Z is stable except in high chloride. Z does not appear to interact directly with small subunits. However, after Z formation, Rubisco assembly occurs in an ATP-independent reaction that requires KCl and small subunits. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Z is a large subunit containing structure that can contribute large subunits to Rubisco under appropriate conditions. Z shares some physical characteristics with reported cyanobacterial L8 core particles. However, formation of Rubisco from Z in the absence of ATP and the presence of small subunits appears to require conditions that otherwise destabilize Z."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180-3590."}], "LastName": "Hubbs", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8514785", "S0021-9258(19)38680-6"]}}]}
