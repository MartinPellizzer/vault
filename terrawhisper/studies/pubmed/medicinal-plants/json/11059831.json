Liver fibrosis was induced by bile duct ligation and scission (BDL/S) in rats. In BDL/S rats, activity levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminse (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), concentration of total bilirubin in serum, and hydroxyproline content of the liver were significantly increased. The ST treatment (either 100 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 4 weeks) in BDL/S rats reduced the serum AST, ALT and ALP activity levels significantly (p< 0.01). Similarly, when compared to the control group, the concentration of hydroxyproline in the livers of the BDL/S rats treated with 100mg or 200mg ST treated rats decreased by 40% and 33% respectively, when compared to the BDL/S control group (p<0.01). The morphological characteristics of fibrotic liver that were observed in the BDL/S control group, improved in the ST treated BDL/S group. In the fibrotic liver of BDL/S rats treated with ST, a marked reduction in the numbers of alpha smooth muscle cell actin positive stellate cells was observed. These results indicate that doses of either 100 or 200 mg/kg/day of methanol extract from S. tetrandra, had an antifibrotic effect in rats with liver fibrosis induced by bile duct ligation and scission."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Resources Research Center, College of Pharmacy Wonkwang University, Iksan, Cheonbuk, S-Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nan", "ForeName": "J X", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bile Ducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11059831", "10.1007/BF02976580"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
