The study involved 84 patients in the safety case reports of P. corylifolia. The adverse events were mainly liver damage (55.95%) and light toxic contact dermatitis (38.10%), sugguesting that P. corylifolia may lead to liver damage and photo toxicity. However, reproductive toxicity and renal damage were only reported in animal studies, but not in clinical reports. Because of its complicated ingredients, the toxic components and mechanisms of P. corylifolia have not been clear at present. Therefore, the authors proposed to strictly apply P. corylifolia in clinic, use it rationally and combine it with other medications. Besides, efforts shall be made to strength the guidance for doctors, the safety monitoring of P. corylifolia and relevant preparations, and actively carry out safety-related basic and clinical studies, so as to give a better guidance to safe medication, full exert the efficacy and avoid the medication risk."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Wen-Yang", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Center for Food and Drug Evaluation, Inspection and Monitorin, Chengdu 610017, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ju-Kai", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dongfang Hospital Affiliated to Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100078, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Gui-Bo", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xue-Min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Psoralea"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29271140", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170919.011"]}}]}
