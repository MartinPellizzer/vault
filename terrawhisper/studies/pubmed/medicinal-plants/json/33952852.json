This present review aims to achieve a comprehensive and up-to-date investigation in the phytochemistry and pharmacology of R. laevigata. According to these findings in the literature, approximately 123 chemical ingredients covering triterpenoids, flavonoids, tannis, lignans and polysaccharides, have been characterized from various parts of this species. Among these isolates, 77 triterpenoids have been isolated and thus regarded as the primary and characteristic substance. Based on the chemical structures, most of the obtained triterpenoids can be classified into polyhydroxy triterpenoids and readily divided into four categories: ursane-type, oleanane-type, lupinane-type, as well as seco-triterpenoids. The crude extracts and the purified compounds have demonstrated various pharmacological effects in vitro and in vivo, such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulatory effect, anti-inflammatory effect, liver protection, kidney protection, cardiovascular protection, neuroprotective effect and improvement of diabetic cataract. Noticeably, these pharmacological results of R. laevigata provide evidences for its traditional uses. In addition, these different chemical ingredients existing in the title plant may have synergistic effects. In conclusion, the chemical profiles, including ingredients and structures, together with the modern pharmacological properties have been adequately summarized. These evidences have revealed this plant to be a valuable source for therapeutic foodstuff and more attention should be paid to a better utilization of this plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mathematical Engineering Academy of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bai-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mathematical Engineering Academy of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mathematical Engineering Academy of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jie-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "58"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33952852", "10.1248/cpb.c20-00743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
