Meyer, and shown to be a macrophage Fc receptor expression-enhancing polysaccharide. The primary structure of GL-4IIb2 was elucidated by composition. 1H NMR, methylation, and oligosaccharide analyses. GL-4IIb2 consisted of 15 different monosaccharides which included rarely observed sugars, such as 2-O-methylfucose, 2-O-methylxylose, apiose, 3-C-carboxy-5-deoxy-L-xylose (aceric acid, AceA), 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid (Kdo), and 3-deoxy-D-lyxo-2-heptulosaric acid (Dha). Methylation analysis indicated that GL-4IIb2 comprised 34 different glycosyl linkages, such as 3,4-linked Fuc, 3- and 2,3,4-linked Rha, and 2-linked GlcA, which are characteristic of rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II). Sequential degradation using partial acid hydrolysis indicated that GL-4IIb2 contained alpha-Rhap-(1-->5)-Kdo and Araf-(1-->5) Dha structural elements, an AceA-containing oligosaccharide, and uronic acid-rich oligosaccharide chains in addition to an alpha-(1 -->4)-galacturono-oligosaccharide chain. FABMS and methylation analyses suggested that the AceA-containing oligosaccharide was a nonasaccharide in which terminal Rha was additionally attached to position 3 of 2-linked Arap of the octasaccharide chain observed in sycamore RG-II. Component sugar and methylation analyses assumed that the uronic acid-rich oligosaccharides possessed a similar structural feature as those in sycamore RG-II. GL-4IIb2 had a larger molecular mass (11,000) than sycamore RG-II (approximately 5000)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oriental Medicine Research Center, Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Fc"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "rhamnogalacturonan II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "89NA02M4RX", "NameOfSubstance": "Pectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Fc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9202408", "10.1016/s0008-6215(97)00055-4", "S0008621597000554"]}}]}
