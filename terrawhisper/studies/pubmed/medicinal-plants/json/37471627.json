Scrophularia amplexicaulis (Scr) is one of the most important medicinal plants in Iran that has anti-cancer activity. The aim of this study was to investigate a novel approach to enhance therapeutic efficacy of Dox (as a chemotherapeutic agent) by co-administration of Scr (as a bioactive herbal compound) in gastric cancer treatment. In the present study, effects of Dox, Scr, and their combinations (Scr-Dox) were evaluated on viability and proliferation of two gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and MKN28). Moreover, morphological changes, invasion, migration, colony formation, and apoptosis rate in the treated cancer cells were evaluated. Expression of BAX, BCL2, SAMC, SURVIVIN, CASP9, P53, MMP9, and MMP2 in the treated cancer cells and untreated controls were evaluated by Real-Time PCR method. Treatments of cancer cells by Scr, Dox, and Scr-Dox significantly decreased proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation of gastric cancer cells. Treatments of cancer cells by Scr, Dox, and Scr-Dox significantly increased apoptosis rate as well as decreased cells mobility through modification of apoptosis- and metastasis-related genes expression. However, anti-cancer activity of Scr-Dox combination was significantly more than Scr and Dox treatments alone. In general, we demonstrated that Scr-Dox combination therapy exerts more profound anti-cancer effects on AGS and MKN28 cell lines than Scr and Dox monotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Bonab Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bonab, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safavi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8230-3715"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Bonab Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bonab, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soltanzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Bonab Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bonab, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hojjati Bonab", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "100885357", "ISSNLinking": "1520-4081"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scrophularia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Van Cutsem E, Sagaert X, Topal B, Haustermans K, Prenen H.
