Plants of this genus are found predominantly in the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific, with some species being widely distributed and others endemic to a region. Almost half of the species of the Alphitonia genus have been reported for their customary (traditional and contemporary) medicinal uses. This includes for the treatment of skin conditions, headache, stomachache, inflammation, and body pain such as joint pain and childbirth.", "The aim of this review is to provide the first comprehensive account on the customary uses including ethnomedicinal uses, and phytochemistry and biological activities of the Alphitonia genus, and to identify gaps in current knowledge and scope for future research of plants of this genus.", "Information relevant to the genus Alphitonia was collected by searching the scientific databases (SciFinder, Google Scholar, ACS publications, PubMed, Wiley Online Library and International Plant name Index). Species names were validated using the World Flora Online database (www.worldfloraonline.org).", "Eight plants from the Alphitonia genus have been reported to be used as customary medicines, i.e. A. excelsa, A. ferruginea, A. franguloides, A. incana, A. neocaledonica, A. petriei, A. philippinensis and A. zizyphoides. A. excelsa, A. petriei, A. philippinensis and A. zizyphoides, have been shown to have biological activities that align with their customary uses, including antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Only five Alphitonia species reported for their medicinal customary uses have been explored for their phytochemistry, i.e. A. excelsa, A. neocaledonica, A. petriei, A. philippinensis and A. zizyphoides. Compounds identified from these plants include those that are well known for their medicinal importance. A. macrocarpa, A. whitei and A. xerocarpus have also been examined for their phytochemistry and have been found to have the same or similar bioactive compounds to those found in customarily used Alphitonia species. No biological activities or phytochemistry studies have been reported for the known customarily used medicinal plants A. ferruginea, A. franguloides and A. incana.", "This review highlights the customary uses, biological activities and phytochemistry of plants of the Alphitonia Reissek ex Endl. genus and highlights the significance of the knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples. Of the plants that have been researched for their biological activities and phytochemistry, there is good correlation with these properties and their customary medicinal uses. However, over half of the plants of the Alphitonia genus, including those that are already reported in the public domain for their customary medicinal uses, have had none or limited biological activities or phytochemistry studies conducted. While only eight species of the Alphitonia genus have been reported as customary medicines, other Alphitonia species also possess medicinally important compounds, and it is possible that they are customary medicines but their uses have not been shared publicly by the Indigenous knowledge custodians. There is clearly much scope for further investigation of this genus with regards to their ethnomedicinal uses and therapeutic potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
