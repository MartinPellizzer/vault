The two sequences differ at 26% of the amino acid positions. Homology was found with a large family of intracellular pathogenesis-related proteins, food allergens and tree pollen allergens from both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species. There is about 30% sequence difference with proteins from species belonging to the same plant order (Apiales: parsley and celery), 60% with those from four other dicotyledonous plant orders and about 70% from that of the monocotyledonous asparagus. More thorough evolutionary analyses of sequences lead to the conclusion that the general biological function of members of this protein family may be closely related to the ability to cleave intracellular RNA and that they have an important role in cell metabolism. As the three-dimensional structure of one of the members of this protein family has been determined recently [Gajhede et al., Nature Struct Biol 3 (1996) 1040-1045], it may be possible to assign active-site residues in the enzyme molecule and make hypotheses about its mode of action. Structural features in addition to the cellular site of biosynthesis indicate that this family of ribonucleases is very different from previously investigated ones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Moiseyev", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fedoreyeva", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhuravlev", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yasnetskaya", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jekel", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beintema", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "SWISSPROT", "AccessionNumberList": ["P80889", "P80890"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEBS Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "0155157", "ISSNLinking": "0014-5793"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pathogenesis-related proteins, plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribonucleases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ribonucleases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9166900", "10.1016/s0014-5793(97)00337-2", "S0014-5793(97)00337-2"]}}]}
