Lignans and neolignans, including tetrahydrofurofuran, tetrahydrofuran, and aryltetralin, are present in the Flos Magnoliae species. A wide range of pharmacological activity of Flos Magnoliae has been reported in medicine. Fargesin has been isolated from Magnolia fargesii and is a lignan-class phytochemical. Fargesin has numerous pharmacological activities in medicine, including its effectiveness on lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, myocardial apoptosis, etc. In the present work, we have summarized the detailed scientific information of fargesin concerning its medicinal properties and pharmacological activities. Numerous biological and chemical aspects of fargesin are discussed here, including the detailed pharmacological activities and analytical aspects of fargesin. In this review, we have also compiled analytical data on fargesin based on available scientific literature. Ethnopharmacological information on fargesin was gathered by a literature survey on Pubmed, Science Direct, Google, and Scopus using the terms fargesin, Flos Magnoliae, phytochemical, and herbal medicine. The present review paper compiled the scientific data on fargesin in medicine for its pharmacological activities and analytical aspects in a very concise manner with proper citations. The present work signified the biological importance of fargesin in medicine due to its significant impact on bone disorders, lung injury, colon cancer, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders, ischemia, sars-cov-2, allergy, lipid and glucose metabolism, melanin synthesis, and different classes of enzymes. Furthermore, fargesin also has anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, antiprotozoal, antimycobacterial, and antifeedant activity. However, analytical methods used for the separation, identification and isolation of fargesin in different biological and non-biological samples were also covered in the present review. The present work revealed the pharmacological activities and analytical aspects of fargesin in medicine and other allied health sectors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8138-6379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Recent Adv Inflamm Allergy Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101776469", "ISSNLinking": "2772-2708"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38726781", "10.2174/0127722708286664240429093913", "RAIAD-EPUB-140283"]}}]}
