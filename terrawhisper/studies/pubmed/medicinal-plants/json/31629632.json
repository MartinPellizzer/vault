All the synthetic compounds were screened for in vitro glucose consumption activity in HepG2 cell lines. The results showed that most of the tested compounds exhibited potent hypoglycemic activity, and the most potent compound 20b exhibited its potency by 3.23-fold of berberine, 1.39-fold of metformin and 1.20-fold of rosiglitazone, respectively.
