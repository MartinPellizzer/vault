Different plants and plant-derived preparations (infusions, encapsulated, etc.) have been used as immunoregulators, several of them with scientific support. Nevertheless, due to the composition complexity of such plant-derived preparations, the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in their beneficial effects remain, in some cases, unclear. In this review article, the most reported plants used in traditional medicine to enhance immunoregulatory capacity are presented, and their effect on the innate immune response is discussed and correlated with their respective phytochemical profile. Understanding how the plant phytochemical profile relates to the observed impact on the innate and adaptative immune response is fundamental to designing plant-derived co-treatments to lessen the symptoms and favor the recovery of COVID-19 patients. In this regard, we propose a prospective guideline for using plants and plant-derived preparations as co-treatments for COVID-19 (and similar viral infections), which could be helpful in the context of the worldwide effort to end the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, The Institute for Obesity Research, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Vargas-Cortez", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9478-2570"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, The Institute for Obesity Research, Zapopan, M\u00e9xico."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences, Zapopan, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Jacobo-Vel\u00e1zquez", "ForeName": "Daniel A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, The Institute for Obesity Research, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences, Monterrey, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Benavides", "ForeName": "Jorge", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36067145", "10.1089/jmf.2022.0038"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
