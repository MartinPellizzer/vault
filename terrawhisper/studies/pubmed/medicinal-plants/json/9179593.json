To investigate this potential, extracts were tested on their capacity to react with diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in a homogeneous medium, and to inhibit Fe2+/ascorbate-induced membrane lipid peroxidation, as estimated by the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Although methanol extracts reduce DPPH radicals more efficiently than ethyl ether extracts, suggesting a potent radical scavenger activity, the ethyl ether extracts were found to be most active in inhibiting lipid peroxidation in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes. In addition, both extracts present peroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activities. Peroxyl radicals were generated by the water soluble 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) azoinitiator, and the scavenging activities of the extracts were measured by the inhibition of cis-parinaric acid (PnA) fluorescence decay in SR. Superoxide radicals were generated either by an enzymatic or a non-enzymatic system, and the scavenger ability was evaluated by the inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. Methanolic extracts are more potent as scavengers of peroxyl and superoxide radicals than the ethyl ether extracts. Apparently, there is a relationship between antioxidant potency and the total phenolic groups content in each extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Bioqu\u00edmica, Faculdade de Farm\u00e1cia, Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dinis", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cunha", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3170-83-0", "NameOfSubstance": "perhydroxyl radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7381JDR72F", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "755BO701MA", "NameOfSubstance": "Bepridil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bepridil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9179593", "10.3109/10715769709084484"]}}]}
