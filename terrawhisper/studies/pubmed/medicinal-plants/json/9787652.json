Phylogenetic comparisons of these strains, known as T1, T3, T5, T6 and T7, and related sequences showed that these strains are indeed strains of PStV. Further, PStV strains appear to be related to each other according to their geographic origin. That is, the Thai strains are more closely related to each other than they are to strains from the USA or Indonesia, despite the variety of symptoms caused by these strains and the overlap of symptom types between the strains from different locations. Like other PStV strains, PStV-Thai can be considered strains of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) but can be distinguished from bean-infecting strains of BCMV and blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (B1CMV) through sequence and host range. No evidence was found that PStV-Thai strains, unlike PStV-Ib, are recombinants of PStV and B1CMV, although the T3 strain may be a recombinant of different PStV sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of viruses of the BCMV group suggest that acquisition of the ability to infect peanut may have occurred only once."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Queensland Department of Primary Industries, Gehrmann Laboratories, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Brisbane, Australia."}], "LastName": "Higgins", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cassidy", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teycheney", "ForeName": "P Y", "Initials": "PY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wongkaew", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dietzgen", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["Y11771", "Y11772", "Y11773", "Y11774", "Y11776"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Potyvirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9787652", "10.1007/s007050050407"]}}]}
