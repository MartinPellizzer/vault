There were approximately 300 children aged 6-26 months in each group and each child was followed for 3 to 6 months. A comparison of the two groups showed: a) that the DSM group mothers were more likely to continue breastfeeding; b) there was no evidence to associate DSM with an increased incidence of episodes of diarrhoea, fever or vomiting; c) the utilisation of health institutions was very similar in the two groups; and d) there was no significant difference in the mothers' assessment of the proportion of children with a \"poor' appetite in either group. This trial met with considerable methodological problems and the results should therefore be interpreted cautiously. There is a great need for more and better designed trials to assess the possible adverse effects of DSM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zumrawi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vaughan", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waterlow", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kirkwood", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7802871", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5771"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Appetite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breast Feeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sudan"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vomiting"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6895739", "10.1093/ije/10.4.303"]}}]}
