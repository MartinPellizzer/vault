The species analyzed were beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), T\u00f3rtola and Coscorr\u00f3n varieties; lentils (Lens esculenta), Laird variety; and chick peas (Cicer arietinum), California-INIA variety. The legumes were soaked in a solution of Na2 EDTA at 0.03% for 16 h and cooked for a predetermined period for each species. They were dried in a tray drier with cross currents of air flowing at a speed of 10 m/min until the residual moisture content was 8%. The water activity in the resulting products ranged from 0.574 to 0.587, thus completely assuring no microbial activity. No important changes were observed in the legumes protein, fat, or fibre contents after processing. The soaking solution was effective in reducing the phytic acid content from 2.99 to 1.64 mg/100 g in the T\u00f3rtola beans, which had the highest acid value prior processing. In all the species the heat treatment reduced the activity of the trypsin inhibitors by at least 50%. Cooking and drying significantly increased protein digestibility in all the legumes studied, with chick peas showing the most dramatic increase: form 54.7% pre-processing to 94.9% post-processing. With regard to Net Protein Ratio (NPR), chick peas had a value of 4.03, followed by T\u00f3rtola beans (3.29), Coscorr\u00f3n (3.09) and lentils (2.61). The NPR value for the casein diet was 4.20."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Agroindustria y Tecnolog\u00eda de los Alimentos, Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias y Forestales, Universidad de Chile, Santiago."}], "LastName": "Est\u00e9vez", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Castillo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Figuerola", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Y\u00e1\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 1984;21(1):41-93", "ArticleIdList": ["6091995"]}, {"Citation": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 1980;13(4):297-335", "ArticleIdList": ["7002470"]}, {"Citation": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr. 1984;21(3):263-87", "ArticleIdList": ["6391824"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1978 Jul-Aug;26(4):784-8", "ArticleIdList": ["353115"]}, {"Citation": "Adv Food Res. 1982;28:93-166", "ArticleIdList": ["6187187"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1656424", "10.1007/BF02196387"]}}]}
