For the extraction of 18 beta-GA from urine two Sep-Pak C18 extractions, hydrolysis with Helix pomatia and three liquid-liquid extractions were performed, using 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (18 alpha-GA) as internal standard. Both 18 beta-GA and internal standard were converted into their pentafluorobenzyl-ester/trimethylsilyl-ether derivatives and detected by flame ionization detection using a WCOT-fused-silica capillary column. Good quality control data were obtained in precision and accuracy tests. The detection limit of the gas chromatographic method was 10 micrograms/l with a urine volume of 10 ml. A detection limit of 3 micrograms/l was obtained by performing GC-MS. The GC method was used to monitor the urinary excretion of 18 beta-GA after licorice consumption by two healthy volunteers and a patient suspected of licorice abuse. Furthermore, it was shown that this GC assay enables to detect other metabolites related to licorice consumption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guillaume", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van der Molen", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kerstens", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dullaart", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wolthers", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9714109", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "P540XA09DR", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helix, Snails"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10510787", "10.1016/s0378-4347(99)00239-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
