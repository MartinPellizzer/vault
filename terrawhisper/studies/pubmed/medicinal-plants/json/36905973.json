Gagnep. The furano-terpenoid was found to be hepatotoxic, but the exact mechanisms remain unknown. The present study demonstrated that administration of CLB at 50\u00a0mg/kg induced hepatotoxicity, DNA damage and up-regulation of PARP-1 in vivo. Exposure to CLB (10\u00a0\u03bcM) induced GSH depletion, over-production of ROS, DNA damage, up-regulation of PARP-1 and cell death in cultured mouse primary hepatocytes in vitro. Co-treatment of mouse primary hepatocytes with ketoconazole (10\u00a0\u03bcM) or glutathione ethyl ester (200\u00a0\u03bcM) attenuated the GSH depletion, over-production of ROS, DNA damage, up-regulation of PARP-1, and cell death induced by CLB, while co-exposure to L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 1000\u00a0\u03bcM) intensified such adverse effects resulting from CLB exposure. These results suggest that the metabolic activation of CLB by CYP3A resulted in the depletion of GSH and increase of ROS formation. The resultant over-production of ROS subsequently disrupted the DNA integrity and up-regulated the expression of PARP-1 in response to DNA damage, and ROS-induced DNA damage was involved in the hepatotoxicity of CLB."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
