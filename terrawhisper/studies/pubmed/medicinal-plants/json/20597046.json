Herbal drugs of these plants have long been used in traditional medicine, and some species are currently used in food and pharmaceutical industries. In the present work, the genetic diversity and affinities of several Satureja species were studied based on Selectively Amplified Microsatellite Polymorphic Loci (SAMPL) using five primer combinations. A total of 515 polymorphic DNA fragments were amplified, with a mean of 103 bands per assay. Among the species the maximum distance was observed between S. hortensis and S. Isophylla, while the maximum degree of similarity was obtained between S. rechingeri and S. khuzistanica. Cluster analysis was performed for all SAMPL data using the neighbor-joining method. All species for which multiple accessions were sampled were monophyletic with maximum bootstrap support. The investigated species were clustered in three main groups. In general, the relationships among Satureja species revealed by the cluster analysis were somewhat congruent with their geographical distributions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Drug Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, GC, Evin, Tehran, Iran. j_hadian@sbu.ac.ir"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hadian", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tabatabaei", "ForeName": "Mohammad Fakhr", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naghavi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jamzad", "ForeName": "Ziba", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Friedt", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Satureja"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20597046", "10.1055/s-0030-1250063"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
