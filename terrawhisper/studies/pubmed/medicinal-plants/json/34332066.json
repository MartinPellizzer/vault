Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Cinnamomum cassia (L.) Presl, Salvia japonica Thunb., and Rosa rugosa Thunb. are used in local and traditional medicine to treat inflammation-related diseases. While the constituents and bioactivities of EOs of the above four Chinese herbals have been reported previously, but their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities have not been systematically evaluated.", "The purpose of this study was to research the chemical constituents, anti-inflammatory activities, and antioxidant activities of EOs of four Chinese herbal medicines.", "Fresh plant materials were collected both in August 2018. The compositions of EOs were determined by the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. TPA (12-O-tetradecylphophenol-13-acetate)-induced mouse ear model was evaluated the anti-inflammatory activities of EOs. The reduction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and RelA protein of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) in the signal pathway (P65) were measured. The antioxidant activities of EOs from four plants were determined by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method.", "A total of 217 compounds were separated and identified from four EOs, mainly including trans-cinnamylaldehyde (68.75%), citronellal (38.16%), linalool (1.02-33.73%), geraniol (19.39%) and citronellol (17.18%). All four EOs reduced the damage of the ear tissue and had certain anti-inflammatory effects, and the EOs of C. citratus (CyCEOs) and S. japonica (SJEOs) had the best anti-inflammatory activities among others, even better than ibuprofen. The four EOs exhibited different DPPH radical-scavenging activities (IC<sub>50</sub>, 0.101-1.017%), where most of them were much lower than that of EOs of C. citratus (CiCEOs) (IC<sub>50</sub>, 0.101%) and EOs of R. rugosa (RREOs) (IC<sub>50</sub>, 0.142%).", "The main components determine diverse propertise of these four EOs, our results suggested that four EOs presented anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect via reducing the expression of TNF-a, IL-6, COX-2, and NF-\u03baB p65, which may provide a new approach for development of new anti-inflammatory drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
