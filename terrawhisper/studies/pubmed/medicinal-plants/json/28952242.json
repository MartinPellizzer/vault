The complexity of systems triggered the formation of consecutive monoculture problems was one major cause. This paper elaborated the physiological and ecological mechanisms of consecutive monoculture problem formation based on the interaction relationship among multiple factors presented in the rhizosphere soil of consecutive monoculture plants. At same time, in this paper the multiple interactions among cultivated medicinal plants, autotoxic allelochemicals and rhizosphere microbial were proposed to be most important causes that derived the formation of consecutive monoculture problem. The paper also highlighted the advantage of 'omics' technologies integrating plant functional genomics and metabolomics as well as microbial macro-omics in understanding the multiple factor interaction under a particular ecological environment. Additionally, taking R. glutinosa as an example, the paper reviewed the molecular mechanism for the formation of R. glutinosa consecutive monoculture problem from the perspective of the accumulation of allelopathic autotoxins, the rhizosphere microecology catastrophe and theresponding of consecutive monoculture plants. Simultaneously, the roles of mutilple 'omics' technologies in comprehending these formation mechanism were described in detail. This paper provides finally a new insight to solve systematically the mechanism of consecutive monoculture problem formation on molecular level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Ministry of Education, Fujian Agriculture and Forest University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fa-Jie", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bao", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng-Qing", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Bioengineering, Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Yun-He", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xin-Jian", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Ministry of Education, Fujian Agriculture and Forest University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yi", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pheromones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pheromones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28952242", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170103.002"]}}]}
