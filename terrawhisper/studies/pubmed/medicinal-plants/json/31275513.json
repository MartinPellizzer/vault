The following electrolytes were prepared: Lactate Ringer solution with additions of 0.1%, 0.5% or 1% of Sodium Fluoride and the extracts of different plants: Artemisia, Syzygium aromaticum (Clove) and Celtis australis. Corrosion resistance was studied using anodic potentiodynamic polarisation and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. At the end of the experiment, microscopic images of wires were performed. ANOVA test with the comparison of Bonferroni and Tukey tests were performed to elucidate comparisons among all groups.", "The higher sodium fluoride concentration is related to negative corrosion potential for both NiTi and CuNiTi orthodontic wire. Hydrosols are associated to positive values of corrosion potential. CuNiTi has a lower corrosion resistance than NiTi.", "The prescription of toothpastes containing sodium fluoride should be reduced especially for patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. Eugenol may be considered as alternative of sodium fluoride for orthodontic patients for its anti-microbial and anti-corrosive effects. <b>Key words:</b>Corrosion behaviour, Sodium Fluoride, Nickel-Tatanium, orthodontic wires, corrosion inhibitors, aromatical plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orthodontist, private practice, PhD student, Physiopathology molecular genetics and biotechnologies laboratory, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Fatene", "ForeName": "Nassiba", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD student, LIMAT-Thermostructural Materials and Polymers Team, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Faculty of science Ben M'sik, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Said", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant professor, Physiopathology molecular genetics and biotechnologies laboratory, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Elkhalfi", "ForeName": "Bouchra", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, Ben Msik Analysis Center, Faculty of Sciences Ben Msik, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Hassan II University, Casablanca, MMorocco."}], "LastName": "Berrada", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, Physiopathology molecular genetics and biotechnologies laboratory, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Mounaji", "ForeName": "Khadija", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor, director of Physiopathology Molecular Genetics and Biotechnologies laboratory, Faculty of Sciences Ain Chock, Center of Health & Biotechnology, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Soukri", "ForeName": "Abdelaziz", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Exp Dent", "NlmUniqueID": "101603132", "ISSNLinking": "1989-5488"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest statement:Authors declare that they have any conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kassab EJ, Gomes JP.
