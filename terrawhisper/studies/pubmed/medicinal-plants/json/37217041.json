However, the camptothecin content in this herb is low, and is far from meeting the increasing clinical demand. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of camptothecin biosynthesis provides an effective strategy for improvement of camptothecin yield. Previous studies have demonstrated several transcription factors that are related to camptothecin biosynthesis, while the functions of HD-ZIP members in O. pumila have not been investigated yet. In this study, 32 OpHD-ZIP transcription factor members were genome-wide identified. Phylogenetic tree showed that these OpHD-ZIP proteins are divided into four subfamilies. Based on the transcriptome data, nine OpHD-ZIP genes were shown to be predominantly expressed in O. pumila roots, which were in line with the camptothecin biosynthetic genes. Co-expression analysis showed that OpHD-ZIP7 and OpHD-ZIP20 were potentially related to the modulation of camptothecin biosynthesis. Dual-luciferase reporter assays (Dual-LUC) showed that both OpHD-ZIP7 and OpHD-ZIP20 could activate the expression of camptothecin biosynthetic genes OpIO and OpTDC. In conclusion, this study offered the promising data for exploring the roles of OpHD-ZIP transcription factors in regulating camptothecin biosynthesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
