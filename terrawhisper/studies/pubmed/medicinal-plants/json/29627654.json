The most of new synthesized compounds displayed moderate to potent antiproliferative activity against test cancer cell lines. Among the derivatives, compound 4 displayed potent inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged from 0.018 to 5.33\u202f\u03bcM against all tested cancer cell lines including drug resistant HCT-8/T. Furthermore, this compound showed low cytotoxicity on normal human cell lines (LO2). The in vitro tubulin polymerization assay showed that compound 4 inhibited tubulin assembly in a concentration-dependent manner with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 7.1\u202f\u03bcM, when compared to standard colchicine (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f9.0\u202f\u03bcM). Further biological evaluations revealed that compound 4 was able to arrest the cell cycle in G2/M phase. Molecular docking study demonstrated the interaction of compound 4 at the colchicine binding site of tubulin. All the results indicated that compound 4 is a promising inhibitor of tubulin polymerization for the treatment of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
