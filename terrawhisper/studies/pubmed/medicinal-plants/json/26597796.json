Usually, the extraction process of natural products involves various techniques targeting separation of a specific class of compounds from a highly complex matrix. Aiding the process entails the use of well-defined and selective molecular extractants with distinctly configured structural attributes. Calixarenes conceivably belong to that class of molecules. They have been studied intensely over the years in an effort to develop new and highly selective receptors for biomolecules. These macrocycles, which display remarkable structural architectures and properties, could help usher a new approach in the efficient separation of specific classes of compounds from complex matrices in natural products. A simple and rapid such extraction method is presented herein, based on host-guest interaction(s) between a calixarene synthetic receptor, 4-tert-butyl-calix[6]arene, and natural biomolecular targets (amino acids and peptides) from Helleborus purpurascens and Viscum album. Advanced physicochemical methods (including GC-MS and chip-based nanoESI-MS analysis) suggest that the molecular structure and specifically the calixarene cavity size are closely linked to the nature of compounds separated. Incorporation of biomolecules and modification of the macrocyclic architecture during separation were probed and confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The collective results project calixarene as a promising molecular extractant candidate, facilitating the selective separation of amino acids and peptides from natural products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter INCEMC Timisoara, 1 Plautius Andronescu, 300224, Timisoara, Romania."}], "LastName": "Segneanu", "ForeName": "Adina-Elena", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter INCEMC Timisoara, 1 Plautius Andronescu, 300224, Timisoara, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Politehnica Timisoara, 2 Piata Victorie, 30006, Timisoara, Romania."}], "LastName": "Damian", "ForeName": "Daniel", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Politehnica Timisoara, 2 Piata Victorie, 30006, Timisoara, Romania."}], "LastName": "Hulka", "ForeName": "Iosif", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter INCEMC Timisoara, 1 Plautius Andronescu, 300224, Timisoara, Romania."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Politehnica Timisoara, 2 Piata Victorie, 30006, Timisoara, Romania."}], "LastName": "Grozescu", "ForeName": "Ioan", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Research and Development for Electrochemistry and Condensed Matter INCEMC Timisoara, 1 Plautius Andronescu, 300224, Timisoara, Romania. salif@auth.gr."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124, Thessalon\u00edki, Greece. salif@auth.gr."}], "LastName": "Salifoglou", "ForeName": "Athanasios", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Amino Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "9200312", "ISSNLinking": "0939-4451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "130036-26-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Calixarenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calixarenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26597796", "10.1007/s00726-015-2132-9", "10.1007/s00726-015-2132-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
