Natural active substances play a significant role in the sustainable pests and pathogenic microbes management. In recent years, natural products- (NPs), antimicrobial peptides- (AMPs), medicinal plant- and plant essential oils (EOs)-related online resources have greatly facilitated the development of pests and pathogenic microbes control agents in an efficient and economical manner. However, a comprehensive comparison, analysis and summary of these existing web resources are still lacking. Here, we surveyed these databases of NPs, AMPs, medicinal plants and plant EOs with insecticidal, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal activity, and we compared their functionality, data volume, data sources and applicability. We comprehensively discussed the limitation of these web resources. This study provides a toolbox for bench scientists working in the pesticide, botany, biomedical and pharmaceutical engineering fields. The aim of the review is to hope that these web resources will facilitate the discovery and development of potential active ingredients of pests and pathogenic microbes control agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
