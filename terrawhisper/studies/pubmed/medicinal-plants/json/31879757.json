Merr has been established, based on analysis of high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint combined with the similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis (DA) and the quantitative analysis multi-components by single marker (QAMS) method. Eleven peaks of the common model were obtained and analyzed using SA, HCA, PCA and DA analysis. These methods indicated a similar conclusion that 31 batches of D. styracifolium samples were categorized into two clusters basically coincident with their geographical regions of origin. Four peaks were identified as schaftoside, isoorientin, isoschaftoside and isovitexin. Schaftoside was selected as the internal standard, and the relative correction factors between schaftoside and the other three flavonoids were calculated using the QAMS method. The accuracy of the QAMS method was verified by comparing with the results calculated by the external standard method. No significant difference between the two methods was found. In conclusion, the established methods were scientifically applied in the quality evaluation of D. styracifolium."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.
