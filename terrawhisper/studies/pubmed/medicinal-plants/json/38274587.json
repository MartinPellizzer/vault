However, most synthetic antimicrobial agents have been linked with adverse side effects and high costs, furthering the need to explore more options. <i>Syzygium cumini</i>, <i>Moringa oleifera</i>, and <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> are three medicinal plants used in traditional medicine systems for various infectious diseases. They contain various phytochemicals that exhibit antimicrobial activities against various bacteria, fungi, and parasites. The mechanisms of their antimicrobial action may involve the disruption of microbial cell walls and membranes, the inhibition of microbial enzyme and biofilm formation, the modulation of microbial gene expression and quorum sensing, and the induction of microbial cell death. Therefore, the present study evaluated the potentials of aqueous and ethanol extracts of <i>S. cumini</i>, <i>M. oleifera</i>, and <i>T. cordifolia</i> in managing infections as measured by their inhibitory effects on species. Materials and method <i>Syzygium cumini</i>,\u00a0<i>M. oleifera</i>, and <i>T. cordifolia</i> were obtained and authenticated, and their aqueous and ethanol extracts were prepared. The antibacterial properties of the aqueous and ethanol extracts were examined. In addition to broth microdilution and biofilm development experiments, we also employed disk diffusion and agar-well diffusion techniques. The inocula of various species, including <i>krusei</i>,\u00a0<i>parapsilosis</i>, <i>utilis</i>, <i>albicans</i>, and <i>glabrata</i>, were prepared for these assays. The synergistic effect of plant extracts with fluconazole was also evaluated. Results <i>Syzygium cumini</i>,\u00a0<i>M. oleifera</i>, and <i>T. cordifolia</i> emerge as promising sources for the development of effective and sustainable antimicrobial interventions. Interestingly, the aqueous and ethanol extracts were effective against the selected species. Also, the synergistic combination of\u00a0plant extracts with fluconazole was observed to triple the potency of the extracts. Furthermore, the potency of the plant extract as an antifungal and synergistic agent\u00a0was ranked as <i>S. cumini</i> > <i>M. oleifera</i> > <i>T. cordifolia</i>. Conclusively, the plant extracts are effective in the management of opportunistic fungal infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Adelakun et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences, Southeast Iowa Regional Medical Center, West Burlington, USA."}], "LastName": "Adelakun", "ForeName": "Adedayo O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, USA."}], "LastName": "Awosika", "ForeName": "Ayoola", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anatomical Sciences, Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine, Monroe, USA."}], "LastName": "Adabanya", "ForeName": "Uzochukwu", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell Biology and Anatomy, Louisiana State University, Health Science Center, New Orleans, USA."}], "LastName": "Omole", "ForeName": "Adekunle E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology Akure, Akure, NGA."}], "LastName": "Olopoda", "ForeName": "Akinyode I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Laboratory Technology, New Land Polytechnic, Ilorin, NGA."}], "LastName": "Bello", "ForeName": "Emmanuel T", "Initials": "ET"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Immunosuppressed patients with clinically diagnosed invasive fungal infections: The fungal species distribution, antifungal sensitivity, and associated risk factors in a tertiary hospital of Anhui Province.
