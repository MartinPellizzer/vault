Zhumian Granules, also known as Sleep-aid Granules or ZG, are a traditional Chinese herbal remedy specifically designed to alleviate insomnia. This formula consists of many components, including Wu Wei Zi (Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus), Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphi Spinosae Semen), and other medicinal plants. According to the pharmacology of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Wu Wei Zi and Suan Zao Ren have the ability to relax the mind and promote sleep. When taken together, they may balance the opposing forces of yin and yang. Therefore, ZG may potentially be used as a therapeutic treatment for insomnia.", "This research was specifically developed to establish a strong empirical basis for the subsequent advancement and utilization of ZG in the management of insomnia. This research aimed to gather empirical data to support the effectiveness of ZG, thereby providing useful insights into its potential therapeutic advantages for persons with insomnia.", "This study utilized Zhumian Granules (ZG), a traditional Chinese herbal decoction, to examine its sedative and hypnotic effects on mice with PCPA-induced insomnia. The effects were assessed using the pentobarbital-induced sleep test (PIST), Morris water maze test (MWM), and autonomic activity test. The levels of neurotransmitters in each group of mice were evaluated using UPLC-QQQ-MS. The impact of ZG on the quantity and structure of hippocampal neurons was seen in brain tissue slices using immunofluorescence labeling.", "ZG was shown to possess active sedative properties, effectively lowering the distance of movement and lengthening the duration of sleep. ZG mitigated the sleeplessness effects of PCPA by elevating the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), while reducing the levels of dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), as well as decreasing neuronal death.", "This research confirmed the sedative and hypnotic properties of ZG and elucidated its probable mechanism involving neurotransmitters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
