Based on the data from Chinese scientific research paper, an investigation regarding the number of the personnel, the distribution, their output of paper, their scientific research teams, high-yield authors and high-cited authors was conducted. The study covers seven subfields of traditional Chinese medicine identification, quality standard, Chinese medicine cultivation, harvest processing of TCM, market development and resource protection and resource management, as well as 82 widely used Chinese medicine species, such as Ginseng and Radix Astragali. One hundred and fifteen domain authority experts were selected based on the data of high-yield authors and high-cited authors. The database system platform \"Skilled Scientific and Technological Personnel in the field of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource Science-Chinese papers\" was established. This platform successfully provided the retrieval result of the personnel, output of paper, and their core research team by input the study field, year, and Chinese medicine species. The investigation provides basic data of scientific and technological personnel in the field of traditional Chinese medicine resource science for administrative agencies and also evidence for the selection of scientific and technological personnel and construction of scientific research teams."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan-hai", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fang-zhou", "Initials": "FZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ce", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun Li-ying"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bibliography of Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomedical Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Laboratory Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workforce"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27141686"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
