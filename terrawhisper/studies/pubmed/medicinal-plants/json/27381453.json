Our aim was to assess the anti-inflammatory and protective effects of saffron extract against I/R-induced renal disturbances.", "A total of 35 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n\u2009=\u20097) as sham, I/R and three groups of I/R that were pretreated with different doses of saffron extract (5\u2009mg/kg, 10\u2009mg/kg, or 20\u2009mg/kg) intraperitoneally. The I/R-induced renal inflammation was assessed by measuring leukocyte infiltration and mRNA expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and tumour necrotic factor-alpha. For the assessment of oxidative stress, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and antioxidant capacity of kidneys were measured in the right kidneys. In addition, plasma creatinine and urea-nitrogen concentrations were determined for renal functional disturbances. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance using the Duncan post hoc test.", "The I/R increased all of the measured parameters, except for the tissue level of ferric reducing/antioxidant power, which decreased. Pretreatment with saffron extract in all doses significantly reduced the severity of these disturbances in such a way that there were no significant differences between the FRAP level and urea-nitrogen concentrations between the sham and all three saffron extract-treated groups. However, the saffron extract could decrease the plasma creatinine concentration, malondialdehyde level, tumour necrotic factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and leukocyte infiltration in a dose-dependent manner.", "The present study showed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and protective effects for the hydro-ethanolic extract of saffron in I/R-induced acute kidney injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudzadeh", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Houshang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ashtiyani", "ForeName": "Saeed Changizi", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yarijani", "ForeName": "Zeynab Mohamadi", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Nephrology (Carlton)", "NlmUniqueID": "9615568", "ISSNLinking": "1320-5358"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ICAM1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chemotaxis, Leukocyte"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Crocus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27381453", "10.1111/nep.12849"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
