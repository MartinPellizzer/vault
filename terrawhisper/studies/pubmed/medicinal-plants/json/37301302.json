(also known as Guggulu) is one of the oldest and most prominent herb used in Ayurvedic medicine. Commiphora mukul plants have traditionally been used to treat inflammation, diabetes, rheumatism, arthritis, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. It has long been used in China, India, Greece, and other countries. Commiphora mukul is an over-the-counter dietary supplement in the United States and Western countries. Commiphora mukul has excellent medicinal and commercial value and deserves further investigation.", "This paper systematically reviews the historical records, application rules, phytochemistry, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, clinical research, and adverse reactions of C. mukul and provides a reference for its comprehensive application in basic research, new drug development, and clinical treatment.", "Literature were collected from databases such as PubMed, CNKI, Web of Science, TBRC, and other sources such as ancient books on traditional medicine, classic books on herbal medicine, and modern monographs. In this study, the application history and modern pharmacological research on C. mukul in the medicine of all ethnic groups were comprehensively and systematically reviewed.", "According to the vast literature, the varieties, morphological characteristics, distribution, and description of C. mukul used in Unani medicine, Ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan medicine, Mongolian medicine, and Uygur medicine are highly consistent. Commiphora mukul is mainly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, obesity, hemorrhoids, urinary system diseases, skin diseases, inflammation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tumors, and other diseases. The core medicinal material combination in different ethnic medical preparations was C. mukul-Terminalia chebula Retz. (101 times), C. mukul-Moschus (55 times), C. mukul-Aucklandia lappa (Decne.) Decne. (52 times), and C. mukul-Acorus calamus L (27 times). Phytochemical studies confirmed that 150 components with different structures had been isolated and identified. Z-and E-guggulsterone are the main isomers in C. mukul. C. mukul has anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypolipidemic, bone resorption, nervous system protection, myocardial protection, antibacterial, and other pharmacological properties. Clinical studies have only identified the role of C. mukul in treating hemorrhoids and lowering blood lipids.", "As an essential traditional medicine, C. mukul is widely used in the national traditional medicine system, and rich in chemical constituents and exhibit pharmacological activities. This study found that current research on C. mukul mainly focuses on its chemical composition and pharmacological properties. However, scientific research on the quality control of medicinal materials, identification of original plants, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology are relatively weak, and research in this area needs to be strengthened."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
