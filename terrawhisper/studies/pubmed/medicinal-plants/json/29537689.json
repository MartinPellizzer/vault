We compared phytochemical profile of both species from invasive populations in Poland. Further, we compared in\u00a0vitro antimutagenic and antioxidant activities of solvent extracts from aerial (AP) and underground parts (UP). In S.\u00a0gigantea, flavonoid profile was dominated by quercetin glycosides, with quercitrin as the major compound. In S.\u00a0canadensis, quercetin and kaempferol rutinosides were two major constituents. Caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) were less diverse with 5-CQA as a main compound. In UP, over 20 putative diterpenoids were detected, mostly unidentified. Several CQAs were present in higher amounts than in AP. Antioxidant and antimutagenic activities were different between species and organs, with the strongest inhibition of lipid peroxidation by Et<sub>2</sub> O and AcOEt fractions from AP of both species (IC<sub>50</sub> 13.33\u00a0-\u00a016.89\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and BuOH fraction from S.\u00a0gigantea UP (IC<sub>50</sub> \u00a0=\u00a013.32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Chemical mutagenesis was completely inhibited by non-polar fractions, but oxidative mutagenesis was inhibited up to 35% only by S.\u00a0canadensis. No clear relationship was found between chemical profiles and antimutagenic activity. In conclusion, both species have diverse activity and their phytochemical profiles should be considered in quality evaluation. UP of these weeds can also provide potential chemopreventive substances for further studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Wo\u017aniak", "ForeName": "Dorota", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, IUNG-Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, 24-100, Pulawy, Poland."}], "LastName": "\u015alusarczyk", "ForeName": "Sylwester", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Weed Science and Tillage Systems, IUNG-Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, 50-555, Wroclaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Domaradzki", "ForeName": "Krzysztof", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Chemistry, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Dry\u015b", "ForeName": "Andrzej", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Wroclaw Medical University, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Wroclaw Medical University, 51-601, Wroclaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Matkowski", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeoylquinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "058C04BGYI", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solidago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29537689", "10.1002/cbdv.201800023"]}}]}
