It is perennial and widely cultivated in China, Japan and Korea. From late August to October in 2021 and 2022, leaf spots symptoms were observed on L. japonica in different planting fields in Yuzhou, Yuanyang and Fenqiu districts, Henan province, China. The disease incidence was above 85% which reduce photosynthesis. Early disease symptoms appeared as small, circular to elliptical, brown spots on the leaves and later the lesions (1 to 5 mm \u00d7 1 to 4 mm) slowly developed yellow haloes. The different brown lesions seldom merge and form larger irregular lesions. Small fragments (3 to 5 mm) of leave tissue were excised from the lesion margins and surface-sterilized in 3% NaClO for 3 min, followed by three washes with sterile distilled water, and then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark for 5 days. A total number of 8 cultures were obtained and purified by single-spore subcultures on PDA for morphological identification. The colonies on PDA were whitish to gray, with cottony aerial mycelium. Conidiophores were fasciculate, olivaceous brown, straight or geniculate, uniform in width, multiseptate, and ranged from 290 to 700 \u03bcm (560 \u03bcm on average, n = 20). Conidia were hyaline, slightly curved or straight, needle shaped, truncate at the base, and terminal at the tip, 3 to 17-septate, and measuring 150 to 240 \u03bcm (180 \u03bcm on average, n = 20). The morphological features were consistent with Cercospora cf. flagellaris Ellis & G. Martin (Groenewald et al. 2013). The genomic DNA was extracted using CTAB method. The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), portions of the actin (ACT), histone H3 (HIS3), and translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (TEF1) genes were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4 (Groenewald et al. 2013), ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2006), and EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). The resulting 537-bp ITS, 226-bp ACT, 410-bp HIS3, and 306-bp TEF1 sequences of isolate JDJ002 were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. OR492367, OR548247, OR548248 and OR548248, respectively). Sequence analysis revealed that ITS, ACT, HIS3 and TEF1\u03b1 sequences exhibited \u226599% of identity with the ITS (KP896013), ACT(KP895965), HIS3(MK991295) and TEF1 (MN180408) sequences of C. cf. flagellaris, respectively. A pathogenicity test was conducted on healthy of L. japonica leaves. The healthy leaves pricked from L. japonica plants, rinsed in autoclaved distilled water three times and dried with distilled filter paper. Then twelve healthy leave were inoculated with a mycelial plug (0.4 cm diameter) harvested from the periphery of two week-old colony. As negative control, leaves inoculated with PDA medium plugs. Inoculated leaves were covered with plastic bags to maintain high relative humidity and incubated at 25\u00b0C in growth chamber. After 7 days, the inoculated leaves showed symptoms identical to those observed in the field under natural conditions, whereas negative control remained symptom-free. Re-isolation of the fungus from lesions on inoculated leaves confirmed that the causal agent was C. cf. flagellaris. Pathogenicity tests were repeated three times by the same methods with the same results. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. cf. flagellaris except Cercospora rhamni Fack., Alternaria alternata, Corynespora cassiicola or Phomopsis sp. causing leave spots on L. japonica in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 116 Huayuan Road, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, China, Zhengzhou, China, 450002; wy412@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, 1 Nongye Road, Zhengzhou, China, 450002; qinyanhong6040@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "YanHong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hua Yuan Road 116, Zhenzhou, Henan, China, 450002; gaosx78@126.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Suxia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 441102, Institute of Plant Protection, Changsha, China; nkyliuys@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuxia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; 15517127870@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Wenping", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huayuan Road 116Jinshui DistrictZhengzhou, Henan, China, 450000; lishaojianli@126.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shaojian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; chuantaolu@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chuantao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 116 Huayuan Road, Zhengzhou, Henan, China, 450002; yunfeiren@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37981571", "10.1094/PDIS-09-23-1865-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
