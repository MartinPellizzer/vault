The various parts of the species in this genus are used in traditional herbal medicine in different parts of the continent for the treatment of malaria, intestinal disorders, cancer, respiratory diseases, and other ailments.", "This study provides a comprehensive and updated review on the ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacology of Fagaropsis species and highlights possible research gaps for further research opportunities, which will be important in the development of new therapeutic drugs.", "The data was retrieved using ethnobotanical books, published articles, electronic sources, and scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Plants of the World, The Plant List, Scopus, Wiley, Web of Science, PubMed, Science direct, and Sci-Finder. Various key search words Fagaropsis, pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, and ethnobotanical uses were used in the detailed study survey.", "Fagaropsis species are used traditionally to treat a wide range of infections such as respiratory diseases, cancer, malaria, intestinal diseases, and ethnoveterinary. Phytochemical investigations indicated 18 phytoconstituents that have been isolated as the main compounds in this genus; triterpenoids (limonoids, norhopane, and norneohopane derivatives), alkaloids, and essential oils. Few in vitro and in vivo pharmacological activities have been analyzed in this genus. They indicated that the extracts and pure compounds contained anti-inflammatory, antiplasmodial, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and insecticidal activities. The phytochemical compounds that may be responsible for these activities are flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids.", "The ethnobotanical values, phytochemistry, and pharmacology discussed in this review paper showed that Fagaropsis species contain different compounds possessing a wide range of biological activities, and they have high medicinal value that is significant in treating different types of diseases. Phytochemical analyses have been performed on two species (F. angolensis and F. glabra) in the literature. More scientific research analyses are still required to explore this genus. In addition, the majority of the currently available bioactivity-related analyses were applied to crude extracts. Thus, further research studies are important to reveal the links between ethnobotanical uses and bioactivity in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
