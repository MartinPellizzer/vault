Wettst. could be of interest in the control of symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but clinical evidence of its efficacy is lacking. This clinical trial assessed the effects of an extract of <i>B. monnieri</i> on parameters that are related to Parkinson's diseases. Twenty volunteers with Parkinson's disease were recruited for a primary, interventional, controlled, parallel, double-blind clinical study. The volunteers were assigned to treatment with either a commercial <i>B. monnieri</i> extract (225 or 450\u2009mg/day) or placebo. The Parkinson's Disease Quality-of-Life (PDQL) questionnaire was applied, and motor activity was assessed before treatment and 30, 60, and 90 days after treatment with the <i>B. monnieri</i> extract or placebo. Characteristics such as age, body weight, and height were also collected. No differences in parkinsonian and systemic symptoms, emotional function, or social function were observed between. The delta percent (\u0394%) showed time-dependent improvements in emotional function with <i>B. monnieri</i> treatment at the daily dose of 450\u2009mg. A strong correlation was found between quality of life and motor outcomes at baseline and 30 days of treatment with <i>B. monnieri</i>, and a moderate correlation for 60 and 90 days of treatment with <i>B. monnieri</i> when compared with baseline time. A moderate correlation was found between motor outcomes and Hoehn and Yahr stages at baseline. Our results suggest that <i>B. monnieri</i> extract can improve emotional function in Parkinson's disease patients, but further clinical trials are needed to confirm this possibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3696-3944"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Andreia Fuentes Dos", "Initials": "AFD"}, {"Identifier": ["000-0001-7470-2871"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics in Basic Attention, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Mar\u00edlia Moraes Queiroz", "Initials": "MMQ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8217-8907"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics in Basic Attention, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Amaral", "ForeName": "Eduarda Carolina", "Initials": "EC"}, {"Identifier": ["000-0001-5773-9912"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Albuquerque", "ForeName": "Edilson Rodrigues", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6976-3661"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Medical and Health Sciences, Paranaense University, Francisco Beltr\u00e3o, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bortoloti", "ForeName": "Durcelina Schiavoni", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3433-5098"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, MS, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gasparotto Junior", "ForeName": "Arquimedes", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1798-7871"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics in Basic Attention, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Louren\u00e7o", "ForeName": "Emerson Luiz Botelho", "Initials": "ELB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8511-0086"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurosciences, Post-Graduate Program in Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics in Basic Attention, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lovato", "ForeName": "Evellyn Claudia Wietzikoski", "Initials": "ECW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6533-0850"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Preclinical Research of Natural Products, Post-Graduate Program in Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics in Basic Attention, Post-Graduate in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Paranaense University, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "L\u00edvero", "ForeName": "Francislaine Aparecida Dos Reis", "Initials": "FADR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Randomized Controlled Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Parkinson Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36800346", "10.1089/jmf.2022.0106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
