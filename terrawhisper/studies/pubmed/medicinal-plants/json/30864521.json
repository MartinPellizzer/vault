Vanillin is a phenolic aldehyde, widely used as a flavoring agent in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries. A variety of pharmacological activities has been attributed to this compound and its main metabolites, vanillic acid and vanillyl alcohol, including their anti-inflammatory ability. The relationship of the anti- inflammatory effects of vanillin, vanillic acid, and vanillyl alcohol and their actions on oxidative stress is well established. Considering that the inflammatory process is related to several pathologies, including new diseases with few therapeutic options, and limited efficiency, the search for effective treatment strategies and discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents capable of modulating inflammation becomes necessary. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of vanillin and its main metabolites for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and their actions on redox status. In addition, the molecular docking evaluation of vanillin, its metabolites and isoeugenol were carried out into the phospholipase A2 binding site."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bezerra-Filho", "ForeName": "Carlos S M", "Initials": "CSM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barboza", "ForeName": "Joice N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal de Sergipe, Sao Crist\u00f3vao, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Marilia T S", "Initials": "MTS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Organization for Drug Control and Research, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sabry", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmaceutical Industries, Future University in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Nasser S M", "Initials": "NSM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade Federal da Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Sousa", "ForeName": "Dami\u00e3o P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CHI530446X", "NameOfSubstance": "vanillin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30864521", "10.2174/1389557519666190312164355", "MRMC-EPUB-97273"]}}]}
