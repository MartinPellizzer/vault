However, the effect of eriodictyol on depression remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the behavioral effects of chronic eriodictyol treatment in rat models of depression induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1\u2009mg/kg) challenge and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that chronic eriodictyol (10, 30, and 100\u2009mg/kg) treatment by oral gavage once daily for 14\u2009days dose-dependently produced antidepressant effect in the forced swim test (FST), but did not alter locomotor activity in the open field test. Moreover, oral administration with eriodictyol (100\u2009mg/kg) for 28\u2009days reversed the depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by LPS or CUMS, as evidenced by significantly increased sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, reduced immobility time in the FST, and reduced latency to feeding in the novelty-suppressed feeding test. In addition, co-administration of subthreshold doses of eriodictyol (30\u2009mg/kg) and transient potential vanilloid 1 receptor antagonist capsazepine (1.5\u2009mg/kg) produced a synergistic effect in these tests. Chronic eriodictyol administration at a dose of 100\u2009mg/kg also rescued the memory deficits induced by CUMS as indicated by the increased exploration index in the novel object recognition test. Altogether, these results demonstrate that eriodictyol attenuates depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and cognitive impairments in rats, and might be a potential therapeutic avenue for depression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ultrasound, Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Neurology."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neuroreport", "NlmUniqueID": "9100935", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4965"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q520486B8Y", "NameOfSubstance": "eriodictyol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Duman RS, Aghajanian GK, Sanacora G, Krystal JH.
