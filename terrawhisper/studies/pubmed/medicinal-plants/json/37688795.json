There is a major interest in using natural and safe plants as food or drink to prevent from cancer. <i>Origanum marjoram</i> (OMAE) is a medicinal plant that can be used as a tea, food, and additive in traditional medicine.", "This study aimed to evaluate the potential anticancer effects of OMAE as a soft drink for daily use against a model cancer, prevention and treatment.", "MCF-7 cells were chosen as model cancer cells. The MTT assay was used to assess the <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> inhibitory effects of OMAE on cell growth. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect specific genes associated with cancer, such as ESR1, Bax, Bcl-2, and p53. Furthermore, the DNA damage was evaluated using the comet assay.", "OMAE has IC<sub>50</sub> of 53.1 and IC<sub>90</sub> of 97.5\u2009\u03bcg/ml dependent inhibition of cell proliferation after 48\u2009h of treatment toward MCF-7. Also, a significant decrease in the expression level of the ESR1 gene in the MCF-7 cell line. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the comet length and comet-positive cells after treatment with OMAE (88.7%) compared with those in the untreated control cells (9.5%), suggesting a high induction of DNA damage by OMAE. Also, OMAE showed a modification in bcl-2, tumor suppressor gene (p53), and Bax levels and influenced the BAX/BCL-2 ratio <i>via</i> releasing the cytochrome C.", "The results of the study were promising, suggesting that the reduced apoptotic rate of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in this work was correlated to the potential anticancer effect of OMAE which would be a suitable preventable drink against cancer. However, further studies are needed to fully understand the potential of OMAE as a cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Qassim University, Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdellatif", "ForeName": "Ahmed A H", "Initials": "AAH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsharidah", "ForeName": "Mansour", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Origanum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37688795", "10.1080/03639045.2023.2257796"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
