A number of antioxidants are suggested to be radioprotectors by virtue of their ability to quench reactive oxygen species, but their radioprotective action has not been investigated so far. In this study, a number of antioxidants were tested for their efficacy in radioprotection using yeast cells. Sulfhydryl compounds (disulfiram at 100 and 200 microM) and reduced glutathione (10 and 100 mM), purified compounds of plant origin, such as curcumin (1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM), quercetin (100 and 500 microM), rutin (100 and 200 microM), ellagic acid (100,200, and 500 microM) and gallic acid (100 and 500 microM)-were studied. The results revealed that all compounds, except gallic acid, specifically protected normal yeast cells from gamma-radiation damage. Using rad 52 mutants, which lack recombinational DNA repair pathway, it has been found that protection was solely brought about by reducing DNA damage rather than by interfering with DNA repair. Results with DNA repair polymerase further substantiated this contention. We conclude that simple eukaryotic yeast cells can serve as a test system not only for rapid screening of radiomodifiers but also to study their mode of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Biology and Health Sciences Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nemavarkar", "ForeName": "Purva", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chourasia", "ForeName": "Bishnavath K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pasupathy", "ForeName": "Karpagam", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TR3MLJ1UAI", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfiram"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfiram"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15163293", "10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v23.i2.70", "69988c136ea159a9,2b1067cd4fd7c258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
