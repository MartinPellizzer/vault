The rats were divided into four groups after the induction of alloxan diabetes. In the experiment, six rats were used in each group: Group 1, normal rats given 2 ml of saline; Group 2, diabetic control rats given 2 ml of saline; Group 3, diabetic rats given aqueous solution of cogent db (0.45 g/body kg weight); and Group 4, diabetic rats given aqueous solution of glibenclamide (600 micro g/kg body weight). The treatment was given for 40 days. After the treatment, fasting blood glucose, plasma insulin, urine sugar and the activities of hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes were determined in normal and experimental animals.", "Treatment with cogent db resulted in a significant reduction in blood glucose and the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the liver, whereas the level of plasma insulin and hepatic hexokinase activity were significantly increased in alloxan-diabetic rats.", "The present investigation suggests that cogent db controls the blood glucose level by increasing glycolysis and decreasing gluconeogenesis with a lower demand of pancreatic insulin than in untreated rats. This is possible because it regulates the activities of hepatic glucose metabolic enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Annamalai University, Annamalai nagar, Tamil Nadu-608 002, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saravanan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pari", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Venkateswaran", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Diabetes Obes Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100883645", "ISSNLinking": "1462-8902"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cogent db"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexokinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexokinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12406037", "10.1046/j.1463-1326.2002.00233.x", "233"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
