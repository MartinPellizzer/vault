The purpose of this study was to set up an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography method that could determine p-hydroxybenzoic acid and vanillic acid simultaneously in rat plasma, and to compare their pharmacokinetics in normal rats and rats with acute cold blood stasis, and further to investigate the influence of different dosages of oral administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained showed that both of the phenolic acids had a higher bioavailability in rats with cold blood stasis than that in normal rats with a higher area under the concentration-time curve and longer mean residence time, and the high dose oral administration group had a higher capacity in blood stasis rats than in normal rats. These results reminded us that changes in health condition could alter the absorption and elimination of both phenolic acids in vivo, and the pharmacokinetic study under pathological conditions provides important information for more rational drug use in clinical situations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2208-5896"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yingni", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xuewei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Shumeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Structure-Based Drug Design and Discovery of Ministry of Education, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dongmei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoqiu", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Typhaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28622708", "10.1002/bmc.4028"]}}]}
