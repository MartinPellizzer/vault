In this study, we investigated in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo pharmacological effects of tussilagonone (TGN), a sesquiterpenoid isolated from Tussilago farfara, on transcription factors relevant for the pathogenesis of psoriasis. TGN inhibited activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT3, leading to the attenuated expression of psoriasis-related inflammatory genes and suppression of keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Mechanistically, we show that the inhibition of NF-\u03baB and STAT3 by TGN is mediated through activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor NRF2. Evaluation of in\u00a0vivo antipsoriatic effects of topical TGN in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis mouse model demonstrated amelioration of imiquimod-induced phenotypical changes, lesion severity score, epidermal thickening, and reduction in dermal cellularity. The spleen index also diminished in TGN-treated mice, suggesting anti-inflammatory properties of TGN. Moreover, TGN significantly attenuated the imiquimod-induced mRNA levels of psoriasis-associated inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides and reduced epidermal hyperproliferation. Taken together, TGN, as a potent NRF2 activator, is a promising therapeutic candidate for the development of antipsoriatic agents derived from medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
