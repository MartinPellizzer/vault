Iron induced stress was observed as indicated by high level of lipid peroxidation, being more steep increase in leaves than roots. In roots, SOD activity was found to increase in metal treated plants except 80 and 160 microM at 72 h, whereas, it decreased in leaves except 10 and 40 microM after 48 h as compared to their respective controls. Among H2O2 eliminating enzymes, POD activity increased in roots, however, it decreased in leaves except at 10 and 40 microM Fe after 48 h as compared to control. At 24 and 48 h, APX activity and ascorbic acid content followed the similar trend and were found to increase in both parts of the metal treated plants as compared to their respective controls. The level of cysteine content in the roots increased at initial period of exposure; however, no marked change in its content was noticed in leaves. In both roots and leaves, non-protein thiol content was found to increase except at higher metal concentrations at 72 h. The data of proline content have shown significant (p<0.01) increase at 40 microM onwards in both part of the plants after 48 and 72 h. Correlation coefficient was evaluated between metal accumulations with various parameters and also between different antioxidant parameters with MDA. Since the level of bacoside-A (active constituent) content in metal treated plants increases, therefore, it is advisable to assess the biological activity of the plants before using for medicinal purposes, particularly in developing countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecotoxicology and Bioremediation Group, National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226 001, India. sinha_sarita@rediffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "Sarita", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bacoside A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16219336", "10.1016/j.chemosphere.2005.07.030", "S0045-6535(05)00940-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
