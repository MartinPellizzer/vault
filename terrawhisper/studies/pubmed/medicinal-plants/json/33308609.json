Isochlorogenic acid (ICGA), which has medicinal value, has been discovered in various plants. As a widespread natural medicine, ICGA should be the subject of further research and development. However, there have been no systematic analyses of ICGA. According to our investigation, ICGA was initially isolated from green coffee extracts by Barnes et al. in 1950. To date, it has been discovered in a variety of tea, vegetables, medicinal diet and TCM materials. ICGA is used as a chemical marker for the quality control of these TCM materials. The metabolic process of ICGA has been studied in detail, conforming to be linear dynamics. Thus, the clear pharmacokinetics of ICGA offers a solid foundation for its research and development. ICGA has multiple biological and pharmacological effects, and studies have mainly focused on its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hypoglycemic, neuroprotective, and cardiovascular protective effects, and hepatoprotective properties. The mechanisms underlying these effects are summarized in this review to provide scientific support and inspiration for the future research and development of ICGA and ICGA-rich natural products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 China Pharmaceutical University.
