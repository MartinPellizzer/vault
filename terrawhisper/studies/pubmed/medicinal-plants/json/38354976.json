Indonesia's biodiversity has made it possible to develop natural medicine. Marine algae have enormous potential, but the types of marine algae used still need to be more varied. Research on the pharmacology of marine macroalgae has been conducted in Indonesia, but studies on such topic related to diabetes mellitus (DM) still need to be completed. This study provides a comprehensive dataset of pharmacological\u00a0anti-diabetic potential of marine macroalgae used for managing DM and reports on preclinical trials that provide pharmacological evidence. Data on the Indonesian marine macroalgae used to lower blood glucose were obtained from online sources. The bioactive chemicals of marine macroalgae have been found efficient at blocking several diabetes enzymes in in-vivo and in-vitro studies, and such chemicals have anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, antioxidant, and other therapeutic benefits. The Google Scholar was used to search for the pharmacological literature with the keywords marine AND macroalgae AND diabetes AND Indonesia. Pharmacological research on the anti-diabetic activity of marine macroalgae has been carried out on five major Indonesian islands, including Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java, Sulawesi, and Papua, which encompassed 12 provinces: Southwest Papua, South Sulawesi, West Kalimantan, Riau Archipelago, Banten, West Java, North Sulawesi, East Java, Yogyakarta, Maluku, Jakarta, and Bengkulu. Articles on preclinical tests (in vitro and in vivo) were also used for the phytochemical problem section. The results briefly describe which class of algae has been widely used in Indonesia as an anti-diabetic. The findings of this research can be utilized to help find DM treatment drugs based on natural resources from marine macroalgae."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie.
