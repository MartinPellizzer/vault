Two major proteins of 40 KD and 14 KD constituting approximately 96% of total garlic proteins have been recently purified at our Institute. This immunocytochemical and ultrastructural study revealed that the 40 KD protein was localized in the parenchyma sheath cells (PSC) of garlic bulbs, whereas the 14 KD protein was present in the cortical cells (CC). Immunogold electron microscopy study indicated that the 40 KD protein was specifically localized in the globular granules of the cytoplasmic area of PSC. Each globular granule was amorphous and homogenous with membrane limiting its outermost layer. The yellowish color of PSC in freshly cut slices of garlic bulb suggested that PSC may have sulfur-containing compounds such as allicin, the primary contributor of the pungency and medicinal properties of garlic. Ellman's reagent test quantitatively revealed that there were 17.8 n moles sulfhydryl (SH)/ml of 40 KD garlic protein. Microtubule tubulin in mitotic figures from PHA-stimulated human short-term whole blood cultures reacted strongly with antitubulin antibody but reacted negatively with anti-40 KD garlic protein antibodies and therefore was not related to the 40 KD garlic protein immunocytochemically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island 10314, USA."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "G Y", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mato", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wisniewski", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sheikh", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9BZQ3U62JX", "NameOfSubstance": "Dithionitrobenzoic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasmic Granules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dithionitrobenzoic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Immunoelectron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Spindle Apparatus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7593270", "10.1002/jcb.240580411"]}}]}
