The total effective rates of the treated group and the control group on symptoms associated with aging were 88.89% and 68.57% respectively (P less than 0.05). The effective rates of the treated group for Kidney-Yang, Kidney-Qi and Kidney-Yin deficiencies were 85.71%, 100% and 87.50% respectively. The effective rates of the control group were 81.82%, 100% and 61.53% respectively. The above results indicated that the symptoms of Kidney-Yang deficiency in the treated group were improved much better than those of the control group (P less than 0.05). Obviously, SOD activity of erythrocyte and SOD/LPO ratio increased remarkably and serum content of LPO decreased significantly in both groups (P less than 0.001). In the treated group, the functional months of age (physiological age) decreased from 751.77 +/- 5.215 to 743.53 +/- 5.144, the effective rate was 68.57%. It showed that these two recipes both had the efficiency on prolonging the functional age (P less than 0.05)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1954661"]}}]}
