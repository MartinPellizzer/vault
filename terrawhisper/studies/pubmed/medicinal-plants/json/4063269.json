When the faba bean protein concentrate or its ethanol extract was present in the diet, a marked decrease was found in the level of circulating cholesterol associated with the lower-density lipoproteins (very-low-, intermediate- and low-density lipoproteins) compared with the level found on the diets containing casein or the faba bean protein concentrate deprived of ethanol-soluble factors. Alterations in apoprotein pattern were detected after the different dietary treatments. In particular, apoA-I appeared in an unusual form with electrophoretic mobility faster than normal in all lipoprotein fractions after feeding the diets that did not lower plasma cholesterol. When the diets contained the faba bean protein concentrate or its ethanol extract, the apoA-I disappeared from the lower-density lipoproteins but its normal form and the unusual one were apparent in the high-density lipoproteins. A moderate increase in faecal excretion of acidic steroids was found after feeding the diets containing the ethanol-soluble factors, irrespective of the protein source. The results are discussed in relation to the presence of saponin and polyunsaturated lecithin in the ethanol extract of the faba bean protein concentrate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mengheri", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scarino", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vignolini", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spadoni", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4063269", "10.1079/bjn19850030"]}}]}
