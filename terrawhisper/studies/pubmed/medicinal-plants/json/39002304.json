Flavonoids are the major bioactive components of S. suberectus. However, there is still limited knowledge of the exact method via which transcription factors (TFs) regulate flavonoid biosynthesis. The full-length transcriptome of S. suberectus was analyzed using SMRT sequencing; 61,548 transcripts were identified, including 12,311 new gene loci, 53,336 novel transcripts, 44,636 simple sequence repeats, 36,414 complete coding sequences, 871 long non-coding RNAs and 6781\u00a0TFs. The SsMYB158 TF, which is associated with flavonoid biosynthesis, belongs to the R2R3-MYB class and is localized subcellularly to the nucleus. The overexpression of SsMYB158 in Nicotiana benthamiana and the transient overexpression of SsMYB158 in S. suberectus resulted in a substantial enhancement in both flavonoids and catechin levels. In addition, there was a remarkable upregulation in the expression of essential enzyme-coding genes associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Our study revealed SsMYB158 as a critical regulator of flavonoid biosynthesis in S. suberectus and laying the foundation for its molecular breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
