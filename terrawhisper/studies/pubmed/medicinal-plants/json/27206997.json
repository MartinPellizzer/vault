Zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and time-kill tests were performed. Further, 108 human teeth were infected with E. faecalis and treated with the medicaments for 1, 7, and 14 days. Cytotoxicity was assessed by exposing L929 fibroblasts to the medicaments.", "Cinnamaldehyde was the main component of CEO. Triple antibiotic paste had the greatest zone of inhibition and the smallest MIC and MBC. Triple antibiotic paste and CEO eradicated planktonic E. faecalis after 4 and 24 hours, while Ca(OH)2 failed to achieve 100% killing after 24 hours. Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil and TAP eradicated biofilm E. faecalis after 7 and 14 days, but Ca(OH)2 could not eliminate E. faecalis after 14 days. Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil was the most biocompatible medicament.", "Cinnamomum zeylanicum essential oil is an efficient antibacterial agent against planktonic and biofilm E. faecalis and it was cytocompatible to L929 fibroblasts. Therefore, CEO has the potential to be used as an antimicrobial agent in root canal treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endodontics, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbaszadegan", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students' Research Committee, School of Dentistry International Branch, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadolahi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran, Phone: +989173140518, e-mail: gholami@sums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Gholami", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Moein", "ForeName": "Mahmoud Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Private practice, Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedani", "ForeName": "Shahram", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center and Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Fars, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Younes", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Western Australia, Australia."}], "LastName": "Abbott", "ForeName": "Paul Vincent", "Initials": "PV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Contemp Dent Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101090552", "ISSNLinking": "1526-3711"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PF5DZW74VN", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SR60A3XG0F", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Hydroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Pulp Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Root Canal Therapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27206997", "10.5005/jp-journals-10024-1811", "1526-3711-1576"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
