Processing is a detoxification method before the toxic traditional Chinese medicine were given to the patients, and mainly impacted the amount of relevant components in Chinese medicinal herbs (increase or decrease). Although there were still some disputes about the toxic components in Pinelliae Rhizoma (mainly referring to the alkaloid substances), more literatures reported that needle-like calcium oxalate crystals and lectin protein in Pinelliae Rhizoma were the main toxic components, and had a significant effect on inflammation and irritation caused by Pinellia Rhizoma. With the development of research methods and the expansion of research angles, researches for the effect of processing on the detoxification mechanism of Pinelliae Rhizoma have been constantly deepened. The recent reports showed that the detoxification mechanism of the herb was correlated with the dosage of detoxifying components, and the effect of relevant excipients in inhibiting a variety of inflammatory cytokines. However, we shall also pay attention to alum and other processing accessories that could cause new toxicity from residual aluminum, and the impact from processing conditions, origin of Chinese medicinal herbs and their combination with other medicinal herbs on Pinellia Rhizoma's toxicity. This paper describes toxic components, different detoxification methods and relevant detoxification mechanisms in Pinelliae Rhizoma to provide the references for further research and development of the plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taizhou Polytechnic College, Taizhou 225300, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Hai-Jian", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of New Drug Delivery System of Chinese Materia Medica under Jiaugsu Provincial Academy of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210028, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Wen-Jing", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taizhou Polytechnic College, Taizhou 225300, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taizhou Fourth People's Hospital, Taizhou 225300, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Juan", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Taizhou Polytechnic College, Taizhou 225300, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinellia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933128", "10.4268/cjcmm20162327"]}}]}
