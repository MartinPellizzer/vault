In this work, ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics coupled with chemometric analysis was utilized for the precise authentication of the Fritillaria species for both raw materials and commercial products. First, a stepwise difference-enlarging chemometric analysis strategy was proposed to analyze eight medicinal Fritillaria species. Subsequently, 21 species-specific markers were discovered and the specificity was investigated under different sample preparation methods. Finally, the obtained species-specific markers were successfully utilized to identify the Fritillaria species in commercially relevant products. This work is the first to report robust and specific markers for authentication of Fritillaria products, showing promise for tracking the supply chain of herbal suppliers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
