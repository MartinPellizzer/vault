In this study, the availability of the TCM formula STA-1 for the treatment of allergic asthma was investigated by conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled and randomized trial. One hundred and twenty patients between the ages of 5 to 20 years with mild-to-moderate asthma were included. These patients were treated with either STA-1 or placebo in a dose of 80 g/kg/day and were administered twice daily for 6 months. The main outcome measures were a daily diary record of symptoms, supplementary bronchodilator and glucocorticoid treatment, changes of pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), changes of total and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (DP)-specific IgE and side effects. The results showed a statistically significant reduction of symptom scores, systemic steroid dose, total IgE and specific IgE in the STA-1 group. Furthermore, STA-1 also improved the pulmonary lung function FEV(1) compared with the placebo group and only minimal side effects were shown. These results suggested that STA-1 is available for the treatment of mild-to-moderate chronic asthma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Chinese Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Tung-Ti", "Initials": "TT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Chieh-Chen", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "Ching-Hsiang", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Dermatophagoides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Dermatophagoides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16619360", "10.1002/ptr.1843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
