Among plants that could offer novel choice to the limited therapeutic alternatives is Amaranthus caudatus. It is typically rich in bioactive compounds such as phenolic acids, lycopene, polyphenols, unsaturated fatty acids, glucosinolates, proteins, soluble peptides, flavonoids, squalene and betacarotene to say the least. As widely reported in the literature, its various capacities to fight diseases when ingested as food or medicine may not be unconnected to these bioactive compounds available in high concentrations. This current review, therefore, harmonized reports from scientific investigations that validated the use of A. caudatus for the treatment of various ailments such as Diabetes mellitus, cancer, malaria, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, helminthic and bacterial infections, inflammation, hepatic diseases and cardiovascular complications. With this, we hope to put in perspective, the key therapeutic options available in the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Jimoh", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Wellington Campus, Wellington 7654, Cape Town, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Lewu", "ForeName": "F B", "Initials": "FB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Trop Biomed", "NlmUniqueID": "8507086", "ISSNLinking": "0127-5720"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "56"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33597473"]}}]}
