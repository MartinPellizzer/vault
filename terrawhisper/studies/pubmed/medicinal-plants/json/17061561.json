Renal clearance of paraaminohippuric acid (PAH) and inulin were detected, then renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were calculated. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated as the division of MABP by RPF. Renal endothelin (ET) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were detected with radioimmunity assay kits, and nitrous oxide (NO) was detected with biochemical kits.", "There was no significant change of GFR in ARD rats, but RPF and NO were decreased, which accompanied by enhanced RVR, ET and Ang II.
