Using ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight (UPLC-Q-TOF)-MS and two types of columns with different chemical properties, we determined the optimum conditions for separating nine sugars (fructose, galactose, glucose, mannitol, sucrose, melibiose, raffinose, manninotriose, and stachyose) commonly found in herbal medicines. Separation was completed within 10\u2009min when an apHera NH<sub>2</sub> HPLC column was used, although galactose and glucose could not be separated. On the other hand, the nine sugars were completely separated within 16\u2009min when a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)pak VG-50 2D column was used. The calibration curves obtained using those two columns gave good linearity for the sugar standards, and the coefficient of determination was 0.995 or higher. Both columns showed excellent performance with short analysis time and high sensitivity. Using our developed method, we were able to quantify sugars in galactose-free herbal medicines within 10\u2009min and in herbal medicines containing galactose within 16\u2009min. We revealed that our method could be used for the analysis of sugars in Angelica acutiloba and Rehmannia glutinosa roots."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Ando", "ForeName": "Hirokazu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Kudo", "ForeName": "Yoshitomi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacognosy, Division of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kanazawa University."}], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "Yohei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1BEM3U6LQQ", "NameOfSubstance": "rehmannia root"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugars"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sugars"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36328522", "10.1248/cpb.c22-00402"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
