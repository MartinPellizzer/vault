Current therapies available for symptomatic treatment of STDs and AIDS are quite expensive beyond the reach of common man and are associated with emergence of drug resistance. Many patients of STDs and AIDS are seeking help from alternative systems of medicines such as Unani, Chinese, Ayurvedic, naturopathy, and homeopathy. Since a long time, medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of many infectious diseases without any scientific evidence. At present there is more emphasis on determining the scientific evidence and rationalization of the use of these preparations. Research is in progress to identify plants and their active principles possessing activity against sexually transmitted pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an objective of providing an effective approach for prevention of transmission and treatment of these diseases. In the present review, plants reported to possess activity or used in traditional systems of medicine for prevention and treatment of STDs including AIDS, herbal formulations for vaginal application, and topical microbicides from herbal origin, have been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Sector 67, SAS Nagar, 160 062, Punjab, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vermani", "ForeName": "Kavita", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "Sanjay", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Chlamydia Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Condylomata Acuminata"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Trichomonas Vaginitis"}], "NumberOfReferences": "118"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11891087", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00009-0", "S0378874102000090"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
