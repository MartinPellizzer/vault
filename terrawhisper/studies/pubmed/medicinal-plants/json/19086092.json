HPLC analysis was performed on an Alltima C(18) column with gradient elution using aqueous 0.2% formic acid solution containing 0.2% isopropanol and acetonitrile.", "All calibration curves showed good linear correlation coefficients (r(2) > 0.9994) within the tested ranges. Limits of detection (S/N = 3) and quantification (S/N = 10) for the three analytes were less than 2.7 and 9.9 ng, respectively. Intra- and inter-day RSDs of retention times and peak areas were less than 2.61%. The recoveries were between 93.2 and 107.5%, and the RSDs were less than 3.83% for the root samples of A. filicinus.", "The HPLC method established is appropriate for the efficient quantitative and qualitative analyses of important phytoecdysteroids in Asparagus species.
