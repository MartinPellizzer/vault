The present study aimed to determine the effects of organic poultry manure applications on the biological value and essential oil content of sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.). In this context, different doses of chicken, k\u0131bele (fermented chicken manure) and turkey manure (750, 1000, 1250 and 1500 kg da<sup>-1</sup> ) with a control (no manure) were applied by sowing.", "The essential oils consisted of p-Allyl-anisole as the most abundant component (5.65-17.90%), followed by nerol (6.69-16.11%), linalool (5.10-10.81%) and z-citral (5.23-10.73%). The contents of most of the chemical constituents varied significantly (P < 0.05) with organic poultry manure applications. The highest concentration for essential oils components was found in the chicken manure application. Both the antioxidant activity and total phenolic amounts of the basil extracts varied significantly as the organic poultry manure applications changed. The highest antioxidant activity and total phenolic amounts were obtained in the treatments with chicken manure doses of 1000 and 1250 kg da<sup>-1</sup> , which were significantly different compared to the other treatments and the control treatment. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the essential oils against bacterial strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. The results of antimicrobial assays indicated that all of the tested microorganisms were affected. The highest antibacterial activity against all tested microbial species was observed with 1250 kg da<sup>-1</sup> chicken manure applications.", "Among the organic poultry fertilizations, chicken fertilization was of particular interest. Especially, chicken manure doses of 1000-1250 kg da<sup>-1</sup> had the highest antibacterial and antioxidant activity, as well as total phenolics, flavonoids and essential oil components. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Field Crops, Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Sciences, Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yaldiz", "ForeName": "Gulsum", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2461-7534"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Field Crops, Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Sciences, Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Camlica", "ForeName": "Mahmut", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Mudurnu S\u00fcreyya Astarc\u0131 Vocational School, Mudurnu Bolu, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozen", "ForeName": "Ferit", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Abant Izzet Baysal University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017.10.07.1246", "Agency": "Scientific Research Project Fund", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum basilicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkeys"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30393851", "10.1002/jsfa.9468"]}}]}
