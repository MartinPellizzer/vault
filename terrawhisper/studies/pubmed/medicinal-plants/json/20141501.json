The compaction characteristics of the oven-dried hot water extract (HWE) were studied using the Heckel equation. The mechanical properties as well as disintegration and dissolution profile of the compacts were also assessed. The results showed that AA1 exhibited high densification due to dye filling while the subsequent rearrangement of the granules did not contribute, significantly, to their densification. The granules had enhanced plasticity as shown by the low yield point, Py. The tablets produced from the extract had good mechanical properties, with hardness increasing with compression pressure while the friability decreased. Of the four disintegrants tested, tablets containing Explotab had the shortest disintegration time of 11\u2009min while tablets containing Prosolv had the longest disintegration time of 40\u2009min. The order of disintegrant property is Explotab > Cellactose > Emcocel > Maize starch > Prosolv. Dissolution results (t(90%)) show that tablets containing Explotab released 100% of the drug in 20\u2009min proving to be the most suitable in acute asthma attack. The order of dissolution is Explotab > Cellactose > Maize starch > Prosolv > Emcocel. It is concluded that incorporation of Explotab (10%w/w) as a disintegrant in AA1 preparation produced tablets of suitable compressional properties and ensured adequate drug release for the management of acute asthma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Raw Materials Development, National Institute for Pharmaceutical Research and Development (NIPRD), Idu, Abuja, Nigeria. martinsemeje@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emeje", "ForeName": "Martins", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izuka", "ForeName": "Amaka", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isimi", "ForeName": "Christiana", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ofoefule", "ForeName": "Sabinus", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kunle", "ForeName": "Olobayo", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Dev Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9610932", "ISSNLinking": "1083-7450"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Combretaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prosopis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20141501", "10.3109/10837450903584910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
