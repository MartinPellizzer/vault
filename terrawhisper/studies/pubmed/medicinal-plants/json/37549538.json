The importance of the microbiome in plant\u2012soil ecosystems is unquestioned and has expanded to influence the medicinal application of some herbal plants via the gut microbiota.", "Herbal plant-microbiome interactions may provide novel knowledge to enhance the robustness of herbal plant crop performance and medicinal applications, which requires a systematic review and preceding discussion.", "The interactions between Panax notoginseng and microorganisms (from soil to host) were reviewed from the literature. The terms \"Panax notoginseng\" and \"microbiota\" were used in combination with the keywords \"microbiota/microbes\", \"bacteria/bacterium\" or \"fungi/fungus\" or \"endophyte\", as well as our targeted bioactive phytochemicals, including saponins and ginsenosides.", "Our study focuses on the famous medicinal herb Panax notoginseng F. H. Chen and proposes that the microbiota is a crucial participant not only in the cultivation of this herbal plant but also in its medicinal application. We also summarize and discuss how these plant\u2012microbe co-associations shape the assembly of plant-related microbiomes and produce bioactive phytochemicals, as well as influence beneficial herbal traits, such as herbal plant health and pharmacology. In addition, we also highlight future directions.", "The rhizosphere and endophytic microbiome of Panax notoginseng are indirectly or directly involved in plant health, biomass production, and the synthesis/biotransformation of plant secondary metabolites. Harnessing the microbiome to improve the quality of traditional Chinese medicine and improve the value of medicinal plants for human health is highly promising."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
