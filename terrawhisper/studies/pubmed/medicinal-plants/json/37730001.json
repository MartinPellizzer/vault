Focusing on six root ginseng (e.g., Panax ginseng-PG, P. quinquefolius-PQ, P. notoginseng-PN, red ginseng-RG, P. japonicus-PJ, and P. japonicus var. major-PJM), the contained non-starch polysaccharides (NPs) were structurally characterized and compared by both the chemical and biological evaluation. Holistic fingerprinting at three levels (the NPs and the acid hydrolysates involving oligosaccharides and monosaccharides) utilized various chromatography methods, and the treatment of H9c2 cells with the NPs by OGD and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced injury models was used to assess the protective effect. NPs from six Panax herbal medicines occupied about 20\u00a0% of the total polysaccharides, which were of the highest content in RG and the lowest in PN. NPs from six ginseng exhibited weak differentiations in the molecular weight distribution, while marker oligosaccharides were found to distinguish PN and RG from the others. Glc and GalA were more abundant in the NPs for PG and RG, respectively. NPs from PQ (100/200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) showed significant cardiomyocyte protection effect by regulating the mitochondrial functions. This work further testifies the role of polysaccharides in quality control of herbal medicine, with new markers discovered beneficial to distinguish the ginseng."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
