Stanyasodhana is the Sanskrit name for a group of medicinal plants, classified for \"improving the quality of milk\". SSK is used by Ayurvedic practitioners for the cleansing and detoxification of breast milk in lactating mothers as well as for the management of various clinical conditions. HC9 is composed of equal ratios of nine different medicinal plants that include Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth., Cyperus rotundus L., Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Cedrus deodara (Roxb. ex D.Don) G.Don, Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers, Holarrhena antidysenterica (Roth) Wall. ex A.DC., Swertia chirata Buch.-Ham. ex Wall., Cissampelos pareira L. and Hemidesmus indicus (L.) R. Br. ex Schult.. It differs from the SSK formulation by having one ingredient [Marsdenia tenacissima (Roxb.)Moon (Murva)] less, due to its unavailability since it is mostly found in tropical hilly tracts of peninsular India and Vindhya ranges as well as in lower Himalayan tracts. All the medicinal plants in the formulation have reported activity against different types of cancers.", "The present study is aimed at evaluating the anticancer activity of the polyherbal formulation (HC9) and its mechanism of action against breast cancer cell lines.", "The effect of HC9 on the viability of breast cancer (MCF-7 and MDAMB231) and non-cancerous (MCF-10A) cell lines was evaluated by MTT assay. The effect on cell growth and colony formation potential of cancer cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion method and soft agar assay, respectively. Cell cycle arrest was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining and analyzed by flowcytometer. Scratch wound assay was used for studying cell migration. Cell invasion was determined by using BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers. The gene expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was examined by RT-PCR. The expression of p53, SMAR1, p16, MMP-2, CDP/Cux, p21, Rb, phospo-Rb (ppRb), VEGF, NF\u049bB and COX-2 proteins was determined by western blotting.", "HC9 significantly altered growth of breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA MB-231. It blocked the cell cycle progression at S phase in MCF-7 by up regulating the expression of p53, p21 and p16 proteins. In MDA MB-231, HC9 induced G1 phase arrest by up regulating the expression of p53, p21 and pRb proteins with simultaneous decrease in ppRb. It significantly reduced migration and invasion in both the cell lines, accompanied by decrease in the expression of MMP-2/9, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF. HC9 decreased the expression of inflammatory markers (NF-\u049bB, COX-2), and modulated the expression of chromatin modulators (SMAR1 and CDP/Cux) in both MCF-7 and MDA MB-231.", "HC9 exhibited potent anticancer activity against breast cancer cells, thereby warranting further pre-clinical and clinical studies in future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
