Suc application with the concentration of 0.5-5\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> significantly promoted plant growth. In contrast, 10\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Suc retarded plant growth and increased contents of anthocyanin and MDA and activity of SOD in comparison to 0.5-5\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Suc. Suc application increased contents of leaf soluble sugar, reducing sugar and trerhalose, as well as isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) activity, increasing supply of C-skeleton for N assimilation. However, total leaf N was peaked at 1\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Suc, which was consistent with root activity, suggesting that exogenous Suc enhanced root N uptake. At 10\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Suc, total leaf N and activities of glutamine synthase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), NADH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (NADH-GDH) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were strongly reduced but NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration was significantly increased. The results revealed that exogenous Suc is an effective stimulant for A. paniculata plant growth. Low Suc concentration (e.g. 1\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) increased supply of C-skeleton and promoted N uptake and assimilation in A. paniculata plant, whereas high Suc concentration (e.g. 10\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) uncoupled C and N metabolisms, reduced N metabolism and induced plant senescence."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
