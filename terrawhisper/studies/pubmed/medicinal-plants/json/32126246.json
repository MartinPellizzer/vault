Withanolide A and Withaferin A from Ashwagandha were shown to improve immunity and have anti-cancer property, respectively.", "Here, we aimed to create reference DNA barcodes for W.\u00a0somnifera and to authenticate root and powder samples of Ashwagandha collected from markets.", "Three plant specimen of W.\u00a0somnifera were collected, and reference DNA barcodes were generated using rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, and ITS2 DNA barcode markers. Market samples in the form of root (n\u202f=\u202f33) and powder (n\u202f=\u202f70) were collected and authenticated using ITS2 and trnH-psbA DNA barcodes.", "Genomic DNA was successfully isolated from all plant specimens and market samples. DNA barcoding showed that 77% of samples were authentic. About 22% of non-authentic samples were powder samples and only 1% were root samples. Among the non-authentic samples, 18% were completely substituted with single species (Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., or Senna auriculata (L.) Roxb.) and 82% were mixed samples containing more than one species. About 63% of the mixed samples contained Ashwagandha as the major ingredient. Furthermore, we identified that six taxonomically divergent plant species from four families were present as adulterants in the mixed samples.", "DNA barcoding revealed that botanical adulteration in the market samples of Ashwagandha is significant. Powder samples are more prone to adulteration than root samples. The adulterated samples contained plant material that is not related to Ashwagandha, which warrants strict quantity control and market surveillance to derive the true medicinal benefits of this medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
