However, there have been few reports regarding its anti-food allergic activity. In this study, we demonstrated that DMY could upregulate the rectal temperature, suppress the development of diarrhea, decrease the levels of serum specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E, histamine, and mouse mast cell protease-1, and promote the production of interleukin-10 in ovalbumin-allergic mice. Moreover, DMY downregulated the population of B cells and mast cells and upregulated the population of regulatory T cells in the spleens of ovalbumin-allergic mice. Furthermore, DMY blocked the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc\u03b5RI)-IgE interaction, inhibited the release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase and histamine in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells, and alleviated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions. These findings indicated that L. pauciflorus derived DMY might have the potential to alleviate food hypersensitivity or allergic diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food and Biological Engineering, Xiamen Key Laboratory of Marine Functional Food, Fujian Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center of Marine Functional Food, Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Exploitation and Utilization of Marine Biological Resources, Jimei University, 43 Yindou Road, Xiamen, 361021, Fujian, P.R.
