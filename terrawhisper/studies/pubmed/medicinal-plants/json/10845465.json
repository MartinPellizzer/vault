(1999) Plant Cell Physiol. 40: 581]. Here, we report that the pH value of the apoplastic fluid in epicotyls increased from 5.8 to 6.6 by hypergravity (300 x g) treatment. When the xyloglucan-degrading enzymes extracted from cell walls of the 1 x g control epicotyls were assayed in buffer at pH 6.6 and 5.8, the activity at pH 6.6 was almost half of that at pH 5.8. In addition, when enzymically active cell wall preparations obtained from 1 x g control epicotyls were autolyzed in buffer at pH 5.8 and 6.6 and then xyloglucans were extracted from the autolyzed cell walls, the molecular mass of xyloglucans incubated at pH 5.8 decreased during the autolysis, while that at pH 6.6 did not change. Thus, the xyloglucans were not depolymerized by autolysis at the pH value (6.6) observed in the hypergravity-treated epicotyls. These findings suggest that in azuki bean epicotyls, hypergravity decreases the activities of xyloglucan-degrading enzymes by increasing the pH in the apoplastic fluid, which may be involved in the processes of the increase in the molecular mass of xyloglucans, leading to the decrease in the cell wall extensibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soga", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wakabayashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoson", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamisaka", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypergravity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10845465", "10.1093/pcp/41.4.509"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
