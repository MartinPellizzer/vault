Among them, compound 5b with 4-methoxy substitution on right aromatic ring was found to be most active on MCF-7, HepG2 and HCT116 cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19, 4.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23, and 6.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. In vitro tubulin polymerization assay showed that 5b could effectively inhibit tubulin polymerization. Further mechanism studies revealed that 5b could induce G2/M phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Molecular docking studies revealed that 5b interact and bind at the colchicine binding site of the tubulin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
