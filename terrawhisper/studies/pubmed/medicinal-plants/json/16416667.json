In Mexico, \"Herbalists\" have practiced since before Spanish times, but now at Mexican medical schools the alternative medicines are not taught. The aim of this work was to carry out a review of the international literature to identify and analyze the use of articles in the treatment of cancer with principles of plant origin. An online review was conducted of citations published between 1985 and 2004, selecting those works in which plant products demonstrated pharmacological activity useful against cancer with particular reference to bowel carcinoma. In 45 articles, we looked for common and scientific names, part of plant and/or its products used as treatment or preventive, used in an experimental in vivo or in vitro model, pharmacological effects and actions, human or animal species studied and apparent efficacy. Fifty-five percent used human cancer cell lines as a model, incubated with plant extracts; 40% used animal species to induce tumors and protect them with plant extracts; only 5% were clinical studies. Additionally, we determined which of these natural products are included in relevant references: two are marketed in Mexico; none were listed in the academic Mexican book \"Vademecum Academico de Medicamentos\"; one was found in Goodman Gilman's The Pharmacologic Basis of Therapeutics, while three were listed in Katzung's Medical Pharmacology. Experimental data support the empirical use of natural plant products against cancer by their chemopreventive effects, but they are not considered drugs. Despite not being listed as drugs, these remedies should be covered in pharmacology courses when evidence of mechanisms of action is available. Our review suggests that medical schools should review \"traditional medicines\" in order that graduates know what treatments patients are using and those that may be of value."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pharmacology, School of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico. jlfigher@servidor.unam.mx"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Figueroa-Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sandoval Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "Guadalupe", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ascencio", "ForeName": "Victoria Jayme", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Figueroa-Espitia", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez Saavedra", "ForeName": "Gabriela", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc West Pharmacol Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7505899", "ISSNLinking": "0083-8969"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16416667"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
