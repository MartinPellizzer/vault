The different concentration of catalpol and 1 mg mL(-1) citicoline were added to the culture plates for 48 h, and the final of catalpol concentration were 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 mg mL(-1), respectively. The cortical neuron was identified by NF-200 antigen and its survival activity detected by MTT assay. The axonal growth of cultured cortical neuron were observed by inverted microscopy with micrometer.", "Immunocytochemistry demonstrated more than 95% of the primary cultured cortical neurons were positive for NF-200 antigen, which indicated the cultured cells were neurons. Neurons survived growing on the concentration of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 mg mL(-1). Compared with blank and 1 mg mL(-1) citicoline group,neurons survival rates were not statistical significant difference. However, it demonstrated that catalpol significantly promoted axonal growth from 1-5 mg mL(-1) (P <0.05). Interestedly, compared with the dose of 2.5 mg mL(-1), axonal growth was shorter at the dose of 5 mg mL(-1), and 2.5 mg mL(-1) catalpol showed the strongest promotion effect.", "The catalpol can enhance cortical neuron axonal growth, but not promote cortical neuron survival."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Hui-feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiao-yu", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2415-24-9", "NameOfSubstance": "catalpol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Axons"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iridoid Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17992998"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
