Several species of this genus are used in folk medicine. This study was designed to investigate the phenolic compounds, antioxidant, anthelmintic, and cytotoxic activities of various extracts (ethanol, methanol, acetone, and water) of N. cadmea. The antioxidant activities of these extracts were analyzed using scavenging methods (DPPH, ABTS, and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activity), the \u03b2-carotene/linoleic acid test system, the phosphomolybdenum method, and metal chelating activity. Among the 4 different extracts of N. cadmea that were evaluated, the water extract showed the highest amount of radical scavenging (DPPH, 25.54 \u03bcg/mL and ABTS, 14.51 \u03bcg/mL) and antioxidant activities (\u03b2-carotene, 86.91%). In the metal chelating and H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> scavenging activities, the acetone extract was statistically different from the other extracts. For the phosphomolybdenum method, the antioxidant capacity of the extracts was in the range of 8.15 to 80.40 \u03bcg/mg. The phenolic content of the ethanol extract was examined using HPLC and determined some phenolics: epicatechin, chlorogenic, and caffeic acids. With regard to the anthelmintic properties, dose-dependent activity was observed in each of the extracts of N. cadmea. All the extracts exhibited high cytotoxic activities. The results will provide additional information for further studies on the biological activities of N. cadmea, while also helping us to understand the importance of this species. Furthermore, based on the results obtained, N. cadmea may be considered as a potentially useful supplement for the human diet, as well as a natural antioxidant for medicinal applications.", "The plants of the Nepeta genus have been extensively used as traditional herbal medicines. Nepeta cadmea Boiss., one of the species belonging to the Nepeta genus, is a species endemic to Turkey. In our study, we demonstrated the antioxidant capacities, total phenolic, flavonoid, tannin content, anthelmintic, and cytotoxic activities of various extracts of Nepeta cadmea. The present study could well supply valuable data for future investigations and further information on the potential use of this endemic plant for humans, in both dietary and pharmacological applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0166-1818"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Science and Mathematics, Faculty of Education, Pamukkale Univ., Denizli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kaska", "ForeName": "Arzu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Science, Pamukkale Univ., Denizli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Deniz", "ForeName": "Nahide", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Science, Pamukkale Univ., Denizli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7i\u00e7ek", "ForeName": "Mehmet", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biology, Faculty of Arts and Science, Pamukkale Univ., Denizli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mammadov", "ForeName": "Ramazan", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0014052", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1147"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthelmintics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "28752-68-3", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "81AH48963U", "NameOfSubstance": "Molybdenum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anthelmintics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzothiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molybdenum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nepeta"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29746001", "10.1111/1750-3841.14167"]}}]}
