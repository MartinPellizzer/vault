Osvald's 72 and genomic cloning were used to isolate members of an oligofamily of chs_H1 genes that codetermine the biosynthesis of prenylated chalcones known to be valuable medicinal compounds present in hop (Humulus lupulus L.). chs_H1 oligofamily members showed more than 99% and 98% identity on nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, and retained all conserved amino acids that form the catalytic center characteristic for \"true\" chalcone synthases. The chs_H1 promoter exhibited low sequence variability in addition to conservation of all predicted cis-regulatory elements. Possible transactivation of the chs_H1 gene with the transcription factor PAP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was assayed using Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltrations of Nicotiana benthamiana and Petunia hybrida plants. Infiltration of N. benthamiana leaves with chs_H1 promoter/GUS chimeras led to a 24.8-fold increase of the GUS activity when coinfiltrated with the pap1 gene. Coinfiltration of the \"native\" chs_H1 gene with pap1 led to an increased accumulation of chs_H1 mRNA as observed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Transgenic lines of P. hybrida expressing the pap1 gene showed unusual patterns of UV-A-inducible pigmentation and anthocyanin accumulation in parenchymatic and medulla cells. Infiltration of transgenic leaves of P. hybrida with chs_H1 and pap1 genes arranged as a tandem led to quick pigmentation within 12 h after UV-A irradiation. It is indicated that the chs_H1 promoter contains functional element(s) mediating an efficient response to PAP1 expression and UV-A irradiation. UV-A also induced chs_H1 mRNA and accumulation of flavonol glycosides in hop leaves. It can be expected that the PAP1 factor could significantly influence the expression of the chs_H1 oligofamily in transgenic hop and modify the hop metabolome."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Centre AS CR, Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, Branisovska 31, 37005 Cesk\u00e9 Budejovice, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matousek", "ForeName": "Jaroslav", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vrba", "ForeName": "Luk\u00e1s", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skopek", "ForeName": "Josef", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orctova", "ForeName": "Lidmila", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pesina", "ForeName": "Karel", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heyerick", "ForeName": "Arne", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baulcombe", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Keukeleire", "ForeName": "Denis", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PAP1 protein, Arabidopsis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "REG3A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.74", "NameOfSubstance": "flavanone synthetase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Humulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatitis-Associated Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17002429", "10.1021/jf061785g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
