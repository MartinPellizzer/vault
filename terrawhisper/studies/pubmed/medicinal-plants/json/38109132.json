From a drug design perspective, natural products (NPs) are more drug-like and are highly compatible with biological systems compared to most synthetic libraries. NPs provide a more efficient and cost-effective approach to new drug discovery. However, the complexity of NPs makes their identification a challenging task. Chimgin, a bicyclic monoterpene with three chiral centers, exhibits a wide range of biological activity. Despite this, the exact structure of chimgin has remained unclear until now. In this study, we quantified the amount of chimgin in <i>Ferula haussknechtii</i> using analytical Reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array detector (RP-HPLC-PDA). Furthermore, we determined the absolute configuration of chimgin through electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Finally, we evaluated its inhibitory effect on AChE through <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> studies. The extraction process yielded an output of 2.82\u2009\u00b1\u20090.10% with an exact amount of 0.62\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009mg of chimgin per 100\u2009g of plant. Based on the results of ECD and TDDFT calculation, the absolute configuration of chimgin was determined to be 1S, 2S, 4S. Chimgin exhibited an inhibitory effect on AChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 37.43\u2009\u00b5M and its mechanism of action was found to be competitive. HighlightsChimgin was isolated from the roots of <i>Ferula haussknechtii</i>.The amount of chimgin in the plant was determined by RP-HPLC-PDA.Its absolute configuration of chimgin was determined using ECD.<i>In vitro</i> acetylcholinesterase activity of the chimgin was evaluated.The docking and molecular dynamic simulation of chimgin was done.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
