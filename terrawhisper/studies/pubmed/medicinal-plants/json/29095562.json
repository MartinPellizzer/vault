The chemical stability of SLs depends on the solvent, the pH, and the presence of nucleophiles. Hydrolysis leads to detachment of the butenolide ring, and plays a crucial role in the initial stages of the signal-transduction process occurring between the receptor and the SL signaling molecule.", "To date, two different mechanisms have been proposed for SL hydrolysis. Results obtained from kinetic, thermodynamic, and mass spectral data for the reaction between the widely used synthetic SL analog GR24 and seven different nucleophiles demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via the Michael addition-elimination mechanism.", "This study provides valuable information on the chemical stability of GR24 in different plant growth media and buffers.
