For this purpose, the nitrogen balance data previously reported for 40 adult human subjects who had participated in 160 nitrogen balance periods fed diets based on rice and beans, with and without animal protein and/or energy supplementation were used. The proposed method is based on the curvilinear response between nitrogen intake and its nitrogen balance. The second degree equation describing the relationship between nitrogen balance and intake is calculated. Using the mathematical concept of the first and second derivatives, the point of inflexion is obtained, and interpreted as that condition wherein the individual utilizes with maximum efficacy the ingested nitrogen; nitrogen ingestion, which corresponds to that point, is therefore taken as the dietary nitrogen recommendation for the individual. When the values obtained by means of the quadratic equation are compared to those obtained by the traditional linear equation, values were found to be statistically equal (p less than 0.05) for both calculation methods. The recommended protein intake of an adult population fed a diet based on rice and beans was 0.80 and 0.77 g/kg/day for the quadratic approach, and for the conventional method, respectively. When this diet was supplemented with 10% milk protein and with the same energy level, the calculated values were 0.64 and 0.71 g protein/kg/day for both methods, in this same order. The essential amino acid intake and absorption values were also calculated from the protein levels recommended by both methods to be in nitrogen balance, from a diet based on rice and beans. Findings revealed, in all cases, that the intakes of each and all essential amino acids met those levels indicated by FAO/WHO, with the exception of isoleucine and the sulphur-containing amino acids, which apparently limit the quality of the diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Navarrete", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Braham", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El\u00edas", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Nueva alternativa para el c\u00e1lculo de recomendaciones de ingesta de prote\u00edna en humanos.
