The structures and absolute configurations of compounds 1-13 were elucidated through comprehensive spectroscopic analysis, NMR and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction. Chlorahololide G (1) represents the first instance of LSDs formed via a C-15-C-9' carbon-carbon single bond, whose plausible biosynthetic pathway was also proposed. Chlorahololides I and J (3 and 4) were deduced to be rare 8,9-seco and 9-deoxy LSDs with C-11-C-7' carbon-carbon bond, respectively. The inhibitory activity against NLRP3 inflammasome activation was evaluated for all isolates, with six compounds (5, 7, 8, 17, 22, and 23) exhibiting significant effects, and IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 2.99 to 8.73\u202f\u00b5M. Additionally, a preliminary structure-activity relationship analysis regarding their inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation was summarized. Compound 17 exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of nigericin-induced pyroptosis in J774A.1 cells. Molecular docking studies suggested a strong interaction between compound 17 and NLRP3."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..
