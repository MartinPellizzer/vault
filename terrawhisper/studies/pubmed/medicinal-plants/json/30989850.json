In this study the three components were determined by HPLC,and the results were analyzed by multiple comparisons,principal components analysis(PCA)and correspondence analysis(CA). The results showed that the contents of components in different growing areas and types(wild and cultivated) reached a significant level(P<0. 05). Baiyu county,Xiaojin county and Ruoergai county had obvious advantages in the accumulation of catechin hydrate,rhien and sensenoside A respectively. The principal component was different in two growing type and the wild environment was conducive to combined anthraquinones accumulation. For active components,normalized planting was better than retail cultivating. Therefore,the effect on the accumulation of chemical components in Rh. tangusticum,should be taken into full account in the selection of the cultural base of Rh. tanguticum. The standardized cultivating is superior to retail cultivating in terms of the accumulation of active ingredients,and standardized planting is inferior to the wild."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Xian-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Guo-Lin", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Fen", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xin-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Culture Base for Systematic Study,Exploration and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource,Standard Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611137,China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Gui-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30989850", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20181226.009"]}}]}
