This type of care, now called self-managed abortion, has historically been achieved in part through botanicals and traditional medicines. Their use continues into the modern day, especially in Asia, Hawai'i, and other Pacific Islands, where indigenous medicine traditions practice alongside allopathic medicine. Many of these botanicals, such as papaya leaves, hibiscus flowers, and young k\u012b, and traditional medicines, such as tianhuafen, yuanhua, and Shenghua Decoction, have undergone scientific and clinical investigation of their potential abortifacient and antifertility action. The incidence of self-managed abortion with such abortifacients in countries with severe abortion restrictions are only estimates, leading to the possibility that legal rulings and societal pressures may cause underreporting. The Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities in the United States also suffer from a lack of abortion access in addition to unique health disparities and barriers to reproductive health care. As difficulties in abortion access increases due to the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, some may seek or even prefer self-managed abortion through traditional methods that have been passed down in their communities. Midwives and other health care providers may then be contacted during this process. This narrative review provides an overview of the literature on the use of botanicals, herbs, and traditional medicines used for self-managed abortion, specifically in Asia, Hawai\u2027i, and other Pacific Islands. Their implications for practice for providers in the United States and further opportunities for research are also presented."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7318-3184"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Complex Family Planning, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, John A.
