These extracts were also tested for total phenolic and tannin content and correlated with antioxidant capacity.", "Total phenolic and tannin contents were found to be the highest in C. nurvala (195 GAE mg/g and 218.3 mg/g CE). SOD mimetic activity was found to be the highest in Crataeva nurvula, although all barks showed activity more than 100 units/mg extract. Lipid peroxidation inhibitory potential was found to be the highest in Crataeva nurvala (83.4% inhibition of MDA formation/10 microg extract), and also showed a comparatively high NO quenching capacity (45.5% per 10 microg extract). The highest NO quenching potential was found in Aegle marmelos (47.3% per 10 microg extract). Cedrela toona showed the lowest LPO inhibitory potential and NO quenching capacity (50.5% and 30.5%, respectively). Buchanania lanzan, a medicinal plant extensively used for inflammatory disorders and Dalbergia sissoo also showed 72.5% and 69.1% LPO inhibitory potential/10 microg extract. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity ranged from 0.24 to 0.39 mmol/L TEAC/mg extract, indicating that all the barks tested had ABTS+ radical quenching capacity.", "Bark of Crataeva nurvula has the highest antioxidant capacity and a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and their plendic content was found."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal Research Section, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, P.O.
