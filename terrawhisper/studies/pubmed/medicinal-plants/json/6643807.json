Treatments were 13.5 or 16.5% dietary crude protein for the first 12 wk of lactation. Complete mixed diets of grass-legume forage and concentrates were fed for ad libitum consumption. Treatment patterns repeated across trials. Yields of milk and 3.5% fat-corrected milk, intake of dry matter, and returns over feed costs were improved by feeding the diet with 16.5% crude protein. Percent milk fat, body weight change, and reproductive performance were unaffected by treatment. The results demonstrate benefit, during early lactation, from supplementing protein to grass-legume based diets containing 13.5% crude protein. Performance responses to increased concentrations of dietary crude protein during early lactation appear greater for multiparous than primiparous cows."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roffler", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thacker", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6643807", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(83)82056-6", "S0022-0302(83)82056-6"]}}]}
