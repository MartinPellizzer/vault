Southern African ethnic groups used multiple plants to treat dermatophytosis and to alleviate the symptoms, yet the anti-dermatophyte properties of most species remain poorly explored.", "Our study aimed to critically review the literature to document southern African plant species used to treat one or more dermatophytic infections, and to summarise scientific evaluations of these and other plant species. Our study aims to stimulate and focus future studies in this field.", "A thorough review of the ethnobotanical books, reviews and primary scientific studies were undertaken to identify southern African plants used traditionally to treat dermatophytosis, thereby identifying gaps in the research requiring further study.", "Eighty-nine southern African plant species are recorded as traditional therapies for dermatophytosis. Scientific evaluations of 140 plant species were identified, although most of the species in those studies were selected for reasons apart from their traditional uses. None of those studies examined the mechanism of action of the plant species, and only a single study screened the extracts for toxicity.", "Despite southern Africa having some of the longest continuous human civilisations globally, as well as unique and diverse flora, and good ethnobotanical records, the anti-dermatophyte properties of southern African medicinal plants remains relatively poorly explored. The efficacy of the majority of plants used traditionally to treat fungal skin disease are yet to be verified and substantial further research is required in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
