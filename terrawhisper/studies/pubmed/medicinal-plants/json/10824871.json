LPS preparations from the two strains contained: glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, arabinose, heptose, glucosamine, galactosamine, quinovosamine, and 3-N-methyl-3,6-dideoxyhexose, as well as glucuronic, galacturonic and 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid. The following fatty acids were identified: 3-OH 14:0, 3-OH 15:0, 3-OH 16:0, 3-OH 18:0 and 27-OH 28:0. The ratio of 3-OH 14:0 to other major fatty acids in LPS 87 was higher that in LPS 97. SDS/PAGE profiles of LPS indicated that, in lipopolysaccharides, relative content of S form LPS I to that of lower molecular mass (LPS II) was much higher in the effective strain 97 than in 87. All types of polysaccharides exo-, capsular-, lipo, (EPS, CPS, LPS, respectively) examined possessed the ability to bind faba bean lectin. The degree of affinity of the host lectin to LPS 87 was half that to LPS 97. Fatty acids (FA) composition from bacteroids and peribacteroid membrane (PBM) was determined. Palmitic, stearic and hexadecenoic acids were common components found in both strains. There was a high content of unsaturated fatty acids in bacteroids as well as in PBM lipids. The unsaturation index in the PBM formed by strain 87 was lower than in the case of strain 97. Higher ratio of 16:0 to 18:1 fatty acids was characteristic for PMB of the ineffective strain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Timiriazev Institute of Plant Physiology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izmailov", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhiznevskaya GYa"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kosenko", "ForeName": "L V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Troitskaya", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kudryavtseva", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Borodenko", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubrovo", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russa", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pietras", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lorkiewicz", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biochim Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "14520300R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-527X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium leguminosarum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10824871"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
