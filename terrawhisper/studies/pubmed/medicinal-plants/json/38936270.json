The method was validated using quality control (QC) samples spiked at low, medium and high levels. Second, we applied the method to quantify the effects of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice (RRTJ) on plasma, liver, and fecal levels of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO, and creatinine in high-fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats, demonstrating the utility of the method.", "The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.04-0.027\u00a0\u00b5M and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.009-0.094\u00a0\u00b5M. The linear ranges for each metabolite in plasma were choline1.50-96\u00a0\u00b5M; L-carnitine: 2-128\u00a0\u00b5M; betaine: 3-192\u00a0\u00b5M; TMA: 0.01-40.96\u00a0\u00b5M; TMAO: 0.06-61.44\u00a0\u00b5M and creatinine: 1-64\u00a0\u00b5M (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.9954). The linear ranges for each metabolite in liver were Choline: 12-768\u00a0\u00b5M; L-carnitine: 1.5-96\u00a0\u00b5M; betaine: 10-640\u00a0\u00b5M; TMA: 0.5-32\u00a0\u00b5M; TMAO: 0.02-81.92\u00a0\u00b5M and creatinine: 0.2-204.8\u00a0\u00b5M (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.9938). The linear ranges for each metabolite in feces were choline: 1.5-96\u00a0\u00b5M; L-carnitine: 0.01-40.96\u00a0\u00b5M; Betaine: 1.5-96\u00a0\u00b5M; TMA: 1-64\u00a0\u00b5M; TMAO: 0.02-81.92\u00a0\u00b5M and Creatinine: 0.02-81.92\u00a0\u00b5M (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.998). The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were\u00a0<\u00a08\u00a0% for all analytes. The samples were stabilized after multiple freeze-thaw cycles (3 freeze-thaw cycles), 24\u00a0h at room temperature, 24\u00a0h at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 20\u00a0days at -80\u00a0\u00b0C. The samples were stable. The average recovery was 89\u00a0%-99\u00a0%. This method was used to quantify TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine levels in hyperlipidemic rats. The results showed that high-fat diet led to the disorder of TMAO and its related metabolites and creatinine in rats, which was effectively improved after the intervention of Rosa Roxburghii Tratt juice\uff08RRTJ\uff09.", "A method for the determination of choline, L-carnitine, betaine, TMA, TMAO and creatinine in plasma, liver and feces samples was established, which is simple, time-saving, high precision, accuracy and recovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
