At present, the most common treatment for gastric cancer is chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy is very harmful to the human body, and some of the injuries caused by chemotherapy are irreversible. Natural products have low toxicity and anti-cancer activity, so they are currently widely studied at present. Natural products are a large variety of compounds naturally found in fruits, vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants. It is reported that natural products have different anti-cancer properties. This review has summarized the study of natural products in inducing gastric cancer cell apoptosis, inhibiting gastric cancer cell metastasis, and inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation. The relevant references on gastric cancer and natural products were obtained from scientific databases, including Pub- Med, Web of Science, and Science Direct. This paper records dozens of natural products with anti-gastric tumor activity and describes the potential living anti-cancer chemical compounds, their element targets, and their underlying mechanism. This review may lay the foundation for future researchers to treat gastric cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wendi", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Haoyue", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Zhengkang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Shiming", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xinru", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Key Laboratory of Chronic Disease Occurrence and Nutrition Intervention, College of Life Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Xiuli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Key Laboratory of Chronic Disease Occurrence and Nutrition Intervention, College of Life Sciences, Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37026490", "10.2174/1871520623666230407082955", "ACAMC-EPUB-130758"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
