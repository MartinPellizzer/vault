This review focuses on medicinal plants mentioned by Avicenna, a great Iranian philosopher and physician (A.D. 980-1037), in his book Canon for treatment of AUB.", "Medicinal plants mentioned in Canon for treatment of AUB were elicited and searched in electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Cochrane library to find studies that confirmed their efficacy. Data were collected for the years 1980-2014.", "The findings included 23 plants belonging to 18 families. Scientific findings have revealed that these plants control AUB through four mechanisms of action including inhibition of inflammatory process, inhibition of prostaglandins production, antiproliferative activity on human cervical cancer cells (HeLa), and estrogenic activity. All of the plants exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and/or in vivo. Cuscuta chinensis and Portulaca oleracea exhibited estrogenic activity. Boswellia carteri, Lens culinaris, Myrtus communis, Polygonum aviculare, Pistacia lentiscus, and Punica granatum have revealed inhibitory activity on biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Some of the mentioned plants including: Ceratonia siliqua, Cuscuta chinensis, Cuscuta epithymum, Cydonia oblonga, Paeonia sp., Portulaca oleracea, Solanum nigrum, Rumex acetosa and Onopordum acanthium have shown antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells.", "Investigation of traditional Iranian medicine literatures can lead to the identification of effective natural medicines for the management of AUB; however, conclusive confirmation of the efficacy and safety of these treatments needs more evaluations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Traditional Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, 1417653761, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mobli", "ForeName": "Masumeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qaraaty", "ForeName": "Marzieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amin", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haririan", "ForeName": "Ismaeil", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hajimahmoodi", "ForeName": "Mannan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Roja", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Gynecol Obstet", "NlmUniqueID": "8710213", "ISSNLinking": "0932-0067"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2015 Sep;292(3):475-6. doi: 10.1007/s00404-015-3758-2", "PMID": "25986896"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "history"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Hemorrhage"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25637505", "10.1007/s00404-015-3629-x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
