In several countries, herbal medicine has effectively treated cold hypersensitivity symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of herbal medicine for the treatment of CHHF in adults. <b><i>Design:</i></b> Through March 31, 2018, comprehensive databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Chinese Academic Journal, and Japanese National Institute of Informatics, to identify relevant studies and extract data. <b><i>Outcome measures:</i></b> Primary: total effective rate (TER); secondary: skin temperature, peripheral blood flow, adverse events. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Fourteen randomized controlled trials (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u2009974) were included. Thirteen studies with dichotomous values showed a significant reduction in CHHF and RP (risk ratio 0.31, 0.24-0.40) when comparing herbal medicine with/without Western medicine, and no treatment or Western medicine alone. Reductions in CHHF and RP were also observed between herbal medicine plus Western medicine and Western medicine alone (risk ratio 0.45, 0.24-0.86), as well as between herbal medicine and Western medicine alone (risk ratio 0.30, 0.21-0.41). In the only study using a placebo arm, herbal medicine was found to be superior to placebo in increasing skin temperature and peripheral blood flow. Six participants exhibited minor adverse drug reactions. Herbal medicine showed a superior TER, especially when combined with Western medicine, to Western medicine alone or placebo. However, there was a high risk of bias within all studies. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Although herbal medicine shows potential to be a safe and effective treatment for CHHF and RP, the high risk of bias in all studies prevents definitive conclusions; thus, higher quality studies must be performed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sasang Constitutional Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Sangji University, Wonju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jun-Sang", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gynecology Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Semyung University, Chungju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dongnyung", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, The Graduate School of Yonsei University, Wonju, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics and Computing, The Graduate School of Yonsei University, Wonju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hyun", "ForeName": "Daesung", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, Republic of Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Environmental & Occupational Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Sei-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Cold Hypersensitivity"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Foot"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hand"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Raynaud Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}], "CoiStatement": "No competing financial interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ushiroyama T, Kamimoto Y, Sakuma K, et al. .
