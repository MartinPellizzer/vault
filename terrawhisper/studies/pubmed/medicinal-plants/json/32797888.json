The MD-\u03bc-SPE of PAHs in matrix samples was carried out, and the impacts of pH, ionic strength, extraction time, temperature, eluent volume, and sorbent mass on the recovery of PAHs were investigated by using Placket-Burman design (PBD). In addition, by using the central composite design (CCD), the best combination of each important variable was measured. Sorbent mass of 14\u00a0mg, eluent volume of 200\u00a0\u03bcL, and 12\u00a0min extraction time at the central level of other factors were optimal conditions of pretreatment for the highest extraction recovery (ER%) of trace PAHs. Under the optimal conditions, the method proposed herein provided high enrichment factors ranged from 116.51 to 133.05, good linearity in the range of 10-3800\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for Pyr, 3.0-3500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for Phe, 5.0-3200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for Nap, and 5.0-3000\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for Ant with coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) values between 0.9889 and 0.9963, low limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) in the range of 0.015-0.061 and 0.485-2.034\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and also satisfactory spiked recoveries (between 95.1% and 106.8%) with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) values in the range of 1.73%-5.62%. The Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Cu: CuO/GO-NC-based MD-\u03bc-SPE followed by HPLC-UV corroborated promising results for the convenient and effective determination of PAHs in the samples of vegetables, fruits, and environmental water. The results of this study revealed that our developed method is easy, feasible, precise, highly effective, and convenient to operate for the trace analysis of PAHs in different real samples. The extraction recovery was about 90% of the initial recovery after the sorbent usage for three times; therefore, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Cu: CuO/GO-NC can readily be regenerated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
