It is spreading around the globe like a pandemic. Major factors behind the development of diabetes can be genetics, environmental factors, dietary choices and obesity. Many medicinal plants have anti-diabetic potential. This study has investigated the anti-diabetic effect of curry leaves extract. This study also investigated the chemical characterization of curry leaves. Phytochemicals including saponins, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols and glycosides were also investigated. Encapsulated 5mg per kg of the body weight and 10mg per kg of the body weight were given to treatment groups I and II. Random blood sugar, fasting blood sugar and HbA1c of 45 diabetic female adults were measured on the 0-day and 45th days. All results were analyzed using the two-sample t-test in IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Curry leaves contained moisture (24.1\u00b11.78)%, ash (17.82\u00b12.13)%, nitrogen free extract (36.12\u00b13.52)%, crude protein (8.32\u00b10.83)%, crude fiber (6.98\u00b12.31)% and crude fat (6.87\u00b10.21)%. Mineral analysis showed that magnesium and calcium were major minerals present in curry leaves. Curry leaves extract contained saponins 2.71\u00b10.23, flavonoids 7.84\u00b10.42, tannins 0.91\u00b10.09, glycosides 0.17\u00b10.01, phenols 3.89\u00b10.12, alkaloids 2.01\u00b10.87. These phytochemicals were expressed in mg/100 g of the sample. Curry leaf extract showed a significant (p<0.05) reduction in fasting blood sugar, random blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin in both treatment groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DHQ Teaching Hospital, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Maidha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RHC, Bhong, Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ul Ain", "ForeName": "Ifrah", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BHU, Budh Ghulam Vehari, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aysha Iftikhar", "ForeName": "Zaheen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Dow University of Health Sciences and Civil Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ubaid", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asim", "ForeName": "Maleha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Govt.
