The 18S rRNA regions of extracted DNA were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and their sequences were determined. In each species, the sequences were found to be of 1809 base pairs (bps) but with different gene sequences. Different base substitutions were observed at nucleotide positions 497, 499, 501 and 712. The same procedure was performed on commercial samples of Ginseng Radix, Panacis Japonici Rhizoma and American Ginseng. Each sequence completely corresponded with that of each original plant, namely P. ginseng, P. japonicus and P. quinquefolius, respectively. This is the first time that 18S rRNA gene sequencing on Panax species was carried out. Previously, Ginseng drugs have been identified mainly by their external and internal structure. Thus this method will be useful in identifying Ginseng drugs at the gene level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute for Wakan-Yaku (Traditional Sino-Japanese Medicines), Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Fushimi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Isobe", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Namba", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 18S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 18S"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8951182", "10.1248/bpb.19.1530"]}}]}
