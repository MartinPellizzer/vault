Sleumer was achieved using axenic seedling explant cultures. Isolated nodes (1.0-1.2 cm) and shoot tips (1.0-1.5 cm) cultured in Murashige and Skoog's agar medium containing varying concentrations of TDZ, BA and combinations of 2iP and GA3. Single shoot (0.8-1.2 cm) was regenerated in each culture after 6 weeks. Axillary shoots were then excised and recultured for 8 weeks in medium containing TDZ (0.05 mgL-1) which formed shoots (about 4 in no.; 2 cm) from the basal node. Axillary branches (2) which formed on 60% of these shoots after 10-12 weeks of culture were separated and recultured in the same medium for 8 weeks. Three shoots (0.8-1.0 cm) per culture were regenerated. Shoots of 0.8-1.8 cm length were subcultured on a low cytokinin (0.01 mgL-1 TDZ) regime to induce shoot elongation (2.0-3.5 cm) in 4 weeks. Shoot cuttings were rooted (60%) in the medium containing IBA (1.5 mgL-1). Rooted plantlets established in pots (90%) after hardening resumed normal growth in 3 months."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Thiruvananthapuram, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satheeshkumar", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seeni", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10927872"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
