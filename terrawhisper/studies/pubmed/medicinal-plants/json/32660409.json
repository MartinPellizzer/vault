The structures of the isolated compound were determined by NMR, GC/MS, and X-ray crystallography studies.", "The isolated compounds 1- 4 [D-mannitol (C1), ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3\u03b2-ol (C2), 5,8- epidioxy-ergosta-6-22-dien-3\u03b2-ol (C3), and palmitic acid (C4)] are white crystal and amorphous powder in nature. All these compounds were isolated from this mushroom for the first time. In vitro lipid peroxidation activities of isolated compounds were determined by ferric thiocyanate (FTC) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method. The sterol derivatives C2 and C3 compounds displayed strong antioxidant activity and were not significantly different (p<0.05) to \u03b1-tocopherol. This finding elaborates on the isolation of a cytotoxic compound C2 and C3 from P. djamor via a rapid elution method.", "The compound C3 has exhibited better cytotoxic activity against MDA-MD-231 and EL4 cells.
