Iron-oxide MNPs (IO-core) (500-800\u00a0nm) were synthesized via co-precipitation; further, the IO-core was coated with heavy-metal-based layers (Ag and MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs) using solvent evaporation. DNase and Vanc were loaded onto the outermost layer of the ML-MNP formed by nanoporous MoS<sub>2</sub> NPs through physical deposition and adsorption. The biofilms of S. mutans or E. faecalis (or both) were formed in a brain-heart-infusion broth (BHI) for 3\u00a0days, followed by treatment with ML-MNPs for 24\u00a0h. The results revealed that coatings of Ag (200\u00a0nm) and ultrasmall MoS<sub>2</sub> (20\u00a0nm) were assembled as outer layers of ML-MNPs successfully, and they formed Ag-Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@MoS<sub>2</sub> MNPs (3-5\u00a0\u03bcm). The DNase-Vanc-loaded MNPs caused nanochannels digging and resulted in the enhanced penetration of MNPs towards the bottom layers of biofilm, which resulted in a decrease in the thickness of the 72-h biofilm from 48 to 58\u00a0\u03bcm to 0-4\u00a0\u03bcm. The sustained release of Vanc caused a synergistic bacterial killing up to 96%-100%. The heavy-metal-based layers of MNPs act as nanozymes to interfere with bacterial metabolism and proliferation, which adversely affects biofilm integrity. Further, loading DNase/Vanc onto the nanoporous-MoS<sub>2</sub>-layer of ML-MNPs promoted nanochannel creation through the biofilm. Therefore, DNase-and Vanc-loaded ML-MNPs exhibited potent effects on biofilm disruption and bacterial killing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
