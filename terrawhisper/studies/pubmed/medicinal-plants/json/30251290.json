Numerous synthetic dyes, finishes, UV absorbers, and optical brightening agents are present in the market for decades for achieving UV protection through textiles. However, due to environmental impacts of these chemical agents, textile industry is looking for alternatives. In this regard, some natural dyes and plant extracts have shown promising results. However, use of colorless plant extracts as UV protective finishes is still rare. In this study, ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rating of bleached cotton fabric has been improved by the application of plant extracts with minimal change in fabric's color. For this purpose, two medicinal plants, that is, Solanum nigrum and Amaranthus viridis were selected and bleached cotton fabric was treated with their methanolic and aqueous extracts. Fabrics treated with both extracts exhibited excellent UPF ratings."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
