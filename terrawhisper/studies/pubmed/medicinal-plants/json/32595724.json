In this study, we compared tissue distribution of six representative active components of EC extract-genipinic acid (GA), protocatechuic acid (PCA), neochlorogenic acid (NCA), chlorogenic acid (CA), (+)-pinoresinol di-O-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside (PDG), and (+)-pinoresinol 4'-O-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside (PG)-between normal rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Each rat was intragastrically given EC extract at a dose of 5.4\u2009g/kg. Rats were sacrificed at 10\u2009min, 30\u2009min, 2\u2009h, and 8\u2009h after administration; six rats were sacrificed at each time point. Then, we quickly harvested their major organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and brain. Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we determined the levels of the above mentioned six components in the organs of both types of rats and then analyzed differences in the tissue distribution. The results showed that levels of each component differed between SHRs and the normal group at each time point. As time progressed, the number of organs in which GA distribution in each tissue of SHRs differed from that of the normal group gradually increased: SHRs showed lower GA levels than normal rats. Levels of PG and PDG in both groups at 10 and 30\u2009min were similar. NCA and CA in the SHR group and the normal group at 10\u2009min, 30\u2009min, and 2\u2009h were also similar to some extent. The results indicated that the pathological state of spontaneous hypertension could affect tissue distribution of EC active components in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Hejia
