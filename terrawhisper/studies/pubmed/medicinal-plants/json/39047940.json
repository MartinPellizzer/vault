This study aimed to elucidate the effects of Mathurameha and its underlying mechanisms against high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction in human endothelial EA.hy926 cells. After confirming no cytotoxic effects, the cells were treated with normal glucose (NG), high glucose (HG), or high glucose plus Mathurameha (HG\u00a0+\u00a0M) for 24\u00a0h. A quantitative label-free proteomic analysis using the sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) approach identified 24 differentially altered proteins among the three groups: 7 between HG and NG, 9 between HG\u00a0+\u00a0M and NG, and 13 between HG\u00a0+\u00a0M and HG. Bioinformatic analyses suggested a potential anti-diabetic action through the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway. Subsequent functional validations demonstrated that Mathurameha reduced the EGF secretion and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in high glucose-treated cells. Mathurameha also exhibited a stimulatory effect on nitric oxide (NO) production while significantly reducing the secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in high glucose-treated cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that Mathurameha attenuated high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction through the EGF/NO/IL-1\u03b2 regulatory axis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals the potential of Mathurameha, a traditional Thai herbal formula, in mitigating high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction, a common complication in diabetes mellitus. Using proteomics and bioinformatic analyses followed by functional validations, the present study highlights the protective effects of Mathurameha through the EGF/NO/IL-1\u03b2 regulatory axis. These findings support its potential use as a therapeutic intervention for diabetic vascular complications and provide valuable information for developing more effective anti-diabetic drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
