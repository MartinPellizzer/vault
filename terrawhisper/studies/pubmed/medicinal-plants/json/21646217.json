Monitoring consumer products for the presence of toxic plants is encumbered by the lack of rapid and specific assays. To create a sensitive, reliable, fast, and broad-spectrum assay for medicinal or toxic plant species, we tested multiplexed ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), which requires partial genomic DNA sequences from species of plants that are not well represented in currently available genetic databases. Genomic DNA was obtained from 21 species of medicinal and/or toxic plants. The PCR products were amplified from these plants and cloned for sequencing. The MLPA method was successful with DNA samples from many different species. The use of a microarray to facilitate screening of potentially thousands of plants in a single assay also was successful. The combination of the specificity of the MLPA assay with the broad-scale capabilities of microarray technology should make this an especially useful tool in screening in foods and commercial herbal preparations to identify the plant compounds actually present. Other applications could potentially extend to the identification of any plant species in samples for academic botanical studies and for biodefense and forensics applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721 USA;"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barthelson", "ForeName": "Roger A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sundareshan", "ForeName": "Padma", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Galbraith", "ForeName": "David W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woosley", "ForeName": "Raymond L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0370467", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9122"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21646217", "10.3732/ajb.93.4.566", "93/4/566"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
