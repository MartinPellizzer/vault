Herein, we reported a facile synthesis of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles using <i>Malva sylvestris</i>. The surface morphology, functional groups, and elemental analysis were done to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles. The cytotoxicity performance of the synthesized nanoparticles was analyzed by exposing nanoparticles to MCF-7 and Hep-G2 cancer cell lines through MTT colorimetric assay and the IC50 value was defined as 100 \u03bcg/mL and 200 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The antibacterial performance of synthesized nanoparticles against four different bacterial strains including <i>Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> were assessed through microdilution broth method. The synthesized Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles using <i>Malva sylvestris</i> demonstrated higher antibacterial effects against Gram-positive strains with MIC values of 62.5 \u03bcg/mL and 125 \u03bcg/mL which increase the inhibitory percentage to more than 90%."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology & Catalysis Research Center, University of Malaya, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Mojtaba", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Center for Nanofibers and Nanotechnology, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Alireza", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarei", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrani", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Savardashtaki", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Bushehr Branch, Islamic Azad University, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology & Catalysis Research Center, University of Malaya, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Chin Wei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mazraedoost", "ForeName": "Sargol", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abassi", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, Faculty of Health and Nutrition, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Systems Environmental Health and Energy Research Center, The Persian Gulf Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramavandi", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Data Brief", "NlmUniqueID": "101654995", "ISSNLinking": "2352-3409"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hashemi S.A., Mousavi S.M., Ramakrishna S.
