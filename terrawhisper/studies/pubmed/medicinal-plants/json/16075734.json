Mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-0.1% aqueous acetic acid (55:45) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL x min. The fluorescence detector was operated at lambdaEX = 254 nm, lambdaEM = 322 nm.", "A satisfactory separation between DNJ and impurity was obtained. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range from 0.567 microg x mL(-1) to 34 microg mL(-1), r = 0.9998. The average recovery was 97.2%. The contents of DNJ in M. alba collected in different seasons and grown in different environment were determined.", "The quantity of DNJ in leaves of M. alba is related to the environment factor, temperature and growing period.
