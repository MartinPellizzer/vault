The collection, preparation, utilization and names of these plants are described, and their role in Cheyenne culture for food, technology, medicine and religion are discussed. Cheyenne plant medicines, though combined with ritualistic healing practices, included the use of many herbal teas which they drank for internal problems, and powders and poultices which they applied externally; many of these were combined to form medicinal mixtures. Certain plants, believed to possess benevolent powers, were employed in various religious ceremonies. Though Cheyennes once cultivated crop plants, their more recent nomadic existence encouraged the use of wild food plants, especially fruits and roots which they sun-dried and stored for winter use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hart", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Indians, North American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Montana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Religion and Medicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7019577", "10.1016/0378-8741(81)90019-2", "0378-8741(81)90019-2"]}}]}
