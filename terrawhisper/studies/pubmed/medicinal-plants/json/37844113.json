Wayanad district of Kerala, with the highest tribal population in South India, is a KFD endemic state, owing to the lack of knowledge, attitude, and practice studies on TBDs and ethnomedicines against ticks. This study was carried out to assess their baseline knowledge, attitude, and ethnomedicinal practice against ticks. A structured questionnaire was used to conduct a survey of 499 tribal members living in forest fringe areas. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that influence the knowledge, attitude, and practice of tribes on TBDs. More than 70% of the population visit the forests on a regular basis, with 65.7% of the population regularly exposed to tick bites; however, only 47.7% were aware of TBDs. About 47.4% of the respondents took precautions like therapeutics and natural remedies to avoid tick bites. Ten species of medicinal plant belonging to eight different families have been identified from the survey. The tribal population use these plants to repel ticks as well as treat tick bites. From the study, we concluded that the limited in-depth knowledge displayed by the tribes can be strengthened by conducting community programs such as awareness classes on TBD and its control measures. The ethnobotanicals identified can be used to formulate novel tick repellents in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6280-9134"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Zoology, National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Sidhik", "ForeName": "Sahina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Zoology, National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Santhosh", "ForeName": "Sithalakshmi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6442-0237"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology and Zoology, National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha, Kerala, India."}], "LastName": "Rathinam", "ForeName": "Balasubramanian", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "100965525", "ISSNLinking": "1530-3667"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ticks"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Tick Bites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Tick-Borne Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Kyasanur Forest Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37844113", "10.1089/vbz.2023.0040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
