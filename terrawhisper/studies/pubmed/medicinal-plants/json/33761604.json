The literature on the active ingredients was then screened manually.", "We summarized the effect of these active ingredients on asthma, primarily including the effect through which these ingredients can regulate the immunologic equilibrium mechanism by acting on a number of signalling pathways, such as Notch, JAK-STAT-MAPK, adiponectin-iNOS-NF-\u03baB, PGD2-CRTH2, PI3K/AKT, Keap1-Nrf2/HO-1, T-bet/Gata-3 and Foxp3-ROR\u03b3t, thereby regulating the progression of asthma.", "The active ingredients from Chinese medicine have multilevel effects on asthma by regulating the immunologic equilibrium mechanism or signalling pathways, giving them great clinical value.
