TIC profiles were evaluated by \"Computer Aided Similarity Evaluation System\" (MATLAB5.3 based, Ver. 1.240, developed by Research Center for Modernization of Chinese Medicine, Central South University). The characteristic peaks in chromatograms were identified by comparing mass data with literatures. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed by SPSS based on the relative peak area (RPA) of identified peak to germacrone in 18 samples.", "Resemblance values of 18 samples of Ezhu were pretty low. The mutual mode fingerprint plots of Ezhu were failed to develop. However, 18 samples were divided into two main clusters based on hierarchical clustering analysis, Curcuma wenyujin cluster and Curcuma phaeocaulis cluster, but the samples of Curcuma kwangsiensis were dispersive. Therefore, based on hierarchical clustering analysis, two mutual mode fingerprint plots of Curcuma wenyujin and Curcuma phaeocaulis were developed. But that of Curcuma kwangsiensis was failed because of low resemblance among samples.", "The mutual mode fingerprint is the basis for quality control of Chinese materia medica from multi-origins. Development of GC-MS fingerprint of Ezhu was failed, which indicates that the chemical components in different species of herbs used as one Chinese materia medica may be significantly different. The relationship of chemical components and pharmacological activities should be further studied so as to elucidate the rationality of Chinese materia medica from multi-origins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Feng-qing", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shao-ping", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian-qing", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yi-tao", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ting-xia", "Initials": "TX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Hua-qiang", "Initials": "HQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes, Germacrane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "curdione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6902-91-6", "NameOfSubstance": "germacrone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9190RTN07X", "NameOfSubstance": "curcumol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes, Germacrane"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16499086"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
