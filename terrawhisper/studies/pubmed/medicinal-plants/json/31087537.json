In the process of 'elution', the sample solution was continuously loaded into the column and the maslinic acid was steadily\u00a0eluted out in this step while highly retained oleanlic acid always stayed in the column. In the process of 'extrusion', the oleanlic acid was pushed out of the column with the stationary phase. In this way, we achieved a large sample loading. A total of 120\u00a0mL sample solution (about 89.55% of the column volume) which contains 600\u00a0mg olive pulp extract was pumped in the apparatus by a constant-flow pump and the maslinic and oleanolic acids were largely separated within 120\u00a0min. Both of these two compounds presented high yields and high purities (271.6\u00a0mg for maslinic acid with 86.7% and 83.9\u00a0mg oleanolic acids with 83.4%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
