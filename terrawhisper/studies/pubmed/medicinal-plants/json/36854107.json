Seventeen new matrine-type alkaloids (<b>1</b>-<b>17</b>), including one new naturally occurring compound (<b>17</b>), along with 20 known ones were isolated from the EtOH extract of <i>S. tonkinensis</i>. Notably, compound <b>5</b> possessed an unprecedented 6/6/5/4/6/6 hexacyclic system. Their structures were confirmed via comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis (IR, UV, NMR, HRESIMS), ECD calculation, and X-ray crystallography. Biological tests indicated that compounds <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>30</b> displayed significant anti-tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) activities compared with the positive control ningnanmycin. Moreover, compound <b>12</b> strongly inhibited the expression of the TSWV <i>N</i>, <i>NSs</i>, and <i>NSm</i> genes and TSWV NSs protein in plant host. Furthermore, compounds <b>4</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>20</b>, and <b>22</b> exhibited moderate insecticidal activities against TSWV thrip vector (<i>Frankliniella occidentalis</i>)."]},
