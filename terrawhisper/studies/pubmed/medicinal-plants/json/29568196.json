The leaves contain genins, saponins, steroidal flavonoids, isoflavones, and coumarins. It has long been used for anti-inflammatory effects.", "This study was designed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of the extract of <i>A. americana</i>.", "<i>A. americana</i> leaves extract is collected and the extract is done by percolation method. Inflammation is induced in experimental animals' carrageenan-induced paw edema model and cotton pellet-induced granuloma model. The extract of <i>A. americana</i> and standard, aspirin and indomethacin are given orally for the anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effects were measured at regular intervals of time to see the percentage inhibition of paw edema and reduction of weight of granuloma with percentage protection to compare the effect of the extract with the control and standard.", "The extract of <i>A. americana</i> showed improved in percentage inhibition of paw edema in graded doses of hydroalcoholic extract of <i>A. americana</i> (HEAA) as compared with control in carrageenan-induced paw edema model. The percentage inhibition of 400 mg/kg of HEAA at the 3<sup>rd</sup> h is almost comparable with the standard, aspirin. On the other hand, graded doses (200 and 400 mg/kg) showed a highly significant reduction (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in the weights of granuloma in comparison with the control in cotton pellet-induced granuloma model. The percentage inhibition of weight of granuloma by 400 mg/kg of HEAA is quite comparable to the standard, Indomethacin.", "Anti-inflammatory activity is seen with the graded dose of HEAA. The plant contains flavonoids and genins which have been shown to have anti-edematous effects in the acute phase of inflammation. Thus, the plant contributes to its anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, higher doses of <i>A. americana</i> leaves need to be used to have the better understanding of the mechanism of anti-inflammation.", "The hydroalcoholic extract from <i>Agave americana</i> (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, HEAA) were studied in carrageenan-induced paw edema model and cotton pellet-induced granuloma model in Wistar rats. The plant contains flavonoids and genins which have been shown to have anti-edematous effects in the acute phase of inflammation. The results were good with the higher doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg of HEAA. Its <i>in vivo</i> anti-inflammatory activity is in good agreement with the traditional use of <i>A. americana</i>. <b>Abbreviation Used:</b> HEAA: Hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Agave americana</i> leaves; SEM: Standard error mean; ANOVA: Analysis of variance; n: Number; g: gram; w/w: weight by weight; h: hour; kg: kilogram; mg: milligram."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India."}], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "Arup Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Varma", "ForeName": "Sushil Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Raipur Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ranjeet", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Beg S, Swain S, Hasan H, Barkat MA, Hussain MS.
