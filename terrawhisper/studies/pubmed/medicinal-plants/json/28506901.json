DC (Fabaceae) as the best candidate to find new antimycobacterial compounds.", "To isolate and characterize the compounds of R. precatoria responsible for the inhibitory and bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC 700084. To determine antimycobacterial synergistic effect of pure compounds and their selectivity index towards Vero cells.", "A total of six flavonoids were purified by silica gel column chromatography. Structural elucidation of the isolated compounds was achieved by using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy techniques. The configuration at the C-3 chiral center was established by quantum mechanical calculation of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum. In vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activity against M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were determined with the redox indicator Alamar Blue (resazurin). Synergy was determined by X/Y quotient. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay.", "The isolated compounds were identified as precatorin A (1), precatorin B (2), precatorin C (3), lupinifolin (4), cajanone (5) and lupinifolinol (6). Compounds 1-3 are new. Compounds 1 to 5 inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis (MIC \u226531.25\u00b5g/mL); compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 killed the bacteria (MBC \u226531.25\u00b5g/mL) and also inhibited M. smegmatis (MIC \u2265125\u00b5g/mL), while 1 and 4 also resulted bactericidal (MBC \u2265125\u00b5g/mL). Compounds 4 and 5 presented synergistic effect (X/Y quotient value <0.5) at a concentration of 1/2 MIC of each compound in the combination. Cytotoxicity in murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) gave IC<sub>50</sub> values of 13.3-46.98\u00b5M, for compounds 1-5.", "In this work we isolated two new isoflavanones (1 and 2), and one new isoflavone (3) with a weak antimycobacterial activity. The (3R) absolute configuration was assigned to 1 by computational analysis of its ECD spectrum and to 2 and 5 by similarity of their ECD spectra with that of 1.
