The three treatments were tested using both IP and PO routes of administration. The extracts were prepared by first extracting the powdered leaves with 95% ethanol, evaporating the ethanol and then partitioning the residue between water and chloroform. The doses of the extracts studied were 60, 120, 240, and 480 mg/kg. The doses of cocaine studied were 3.45, 6.9, 13.8 and 27.6 mg/kg. These doses corresponded to the amount of cocaine contained in the four doses of the chloroform layer. Cocaine and the chloroform layer (via both routes) produced dose related increases in locomotor activity and dose related decreases in food consumption. The water layer (containing only trace amounts of cocaine) produced no changes in locomotor activity; however, the highest IP dose did significantly reduce food consumption. Furthermore two of the doses (one IP, one PO) of the chloroform layer produced significantly greater effects than an equivalent amount of cocaine. These data suggest that plant constitutents other than cocaine may contribute to the overall effect achieved by chewing the leaf."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bedford", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lovell", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Turner", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elsohly", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "271-78-3526", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I5Y540LHVR", "NameOfSubstance": "Cocaine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cocaine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7422695", "10.1016/0091-3057(80)90246-4", "0091-3057(80)90246-4"]}}]}
