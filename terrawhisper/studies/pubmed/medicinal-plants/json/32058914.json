Cuminaldehye and isoeugenol, are hydrophobic essential oil components (EOC), are showing drastic limitations in their applications by low water solubility and the respective volatility. Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin inclusion complexes (M\u03b2CD-ICs) were prepared in aqueous solution and in solid state with the EOC via the ultrasonication method, an energy saving, high efficiency and eco-friend technique, aim to extend their aqueous solubility and biological properties. UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and computational simulations confirmed the formation of EOC/M\u03b2CD-ICs. Result of solubility studies proved the enhanced solubilization of EOC in the presence of M\u03b2CD in aqueous and double reciprocal profiles substantiated the guest/host stoichiometry of 1:1. TGA and DSC studies indicated the improved stability of EOC in M\u03b2CD-ICs. The efficiency of ICs in terms of the antioxidant activity was verified and the IC displayed higher antioxidant activity compared to that of free EOC, as determined by free radical scavenging assay. Finally, the antibacterial effect of EOC/M\u03b2CD-ICs against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria was demonstrated. Overall results not only revealed the potential of M\u03b2CD on the bioavailability, solubility and stability, but also that the intensification caused by the IC may be greater that the antioxidant and antibacterial effects of the selected EOC for this study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
