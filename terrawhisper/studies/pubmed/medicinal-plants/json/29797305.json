The exploration of plants and discovery of natural compounds based on ethnopharmacology in combination with high sophisticated analytics is still today an important drug discovery to characterize and validate potential leads. Due to structural complexity, low abundance in biological material, and high costs in chemical synthesis, alternative ways in production like plant cell cultures, heterologous biosynthesis, and synthetic biotechnology are applied. The basis for any biotechnological process is deep knowledge in genetic regulation of pathways and protein expression with regard to todays \"omics\" technologies. The high number genetic techniques allowed the implementation of combinatorial biosynthesis and wide genome sequencing. Consequently, genetics allowed functional expression of biosynthetic cascades from plants and to reconstitute low-performing pathways in more productive heterologous microorganisms. Thus, <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis in heterologous hosts requires fundamental understanding of pathway reconstruction and multitude of genes in a foreign organism. Here, actual concepts and strategies are discussed for pathway reconstruction and genome sequencing techniques cloning tools to bridge the gap between ethnopharmaceutical drug discovery to industrial biotechnology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TU Dortmund University, Biochemical and Chemical Engineering, Technical Biochemistry, Dortmund, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kayser", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioengineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Systems Biology"}], "CoiStatement": "The author declares no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29797305", "10.1055/a-0631-3876"]}}]}
