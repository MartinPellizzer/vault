Effects attributable to condensed tannins were assessed by growing the plant under high and low levels of soil fertility, inducing low and high concentrations of tannin (Expt 1), or by binding the tannins through spraying the herbage with polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 3350, PEG; Expt 2). Primary-growth lotus was used in Expt 1 and secondary-growth lotus in Expt 2. Concentrations of total and free condensed tannin were determined in fresh lotus, free tanning being defined as that not bound by mascerates of the plant. In Expt 1 the herbages fed contained respectively 46 and 106 g total condensed tannin/kg dry matter (DM) and 3 and 14 g free condensed tannin/kg DM. Mean metabolizable energy (ME) intakes were 0.89 and 0.77 MJ/kg live weight0 .75 per d (P less than 0.05) respectively. The lotus used in Expt 2 contained 63 and 5 g total reactive condensed tannin and free condensed tannin/kg DM respectively. After spraying with PEG at 2.4 g/g total condensed tannin, these values were reduced to 7 and 0.5 g/kg DM respectively. PEG addition increased apparent digestibility (proportion of each nutrient ingested) of cellulose, hemicellulose and nitrogen by 0.05, 0.08 and 0.26, and increased ME intake from 0.48 to 0.69 MJ/kg live weight0 .75 per d. It was concluded that high concentrations of condensed tannins depressed ME intake, due to depressions in both the voluntary intake and digestion of organic matter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duncan", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6722089", "10.1079/bjn19840054", "S0007114584000556"]}}]}
