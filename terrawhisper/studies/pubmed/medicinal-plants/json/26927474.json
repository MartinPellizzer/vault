The 5 herbs with the highest virus inhibitory effects were Herba agastaches, Flos chrysanthemi indici, Rhizoma anemarrhenae, Astragalus root and Baikal skullcap root and these were used in herbal formulations. Anti-NDV activities of 4 formulations were tested on the growth of NDV in the DF-1 fibroblast cell line. Formulation II, containing Baikal skullcap root, Astragalus root, Anemarrhena rhizome (1:1:2) and formulation IV containing Anemarrhena rhizome, Astragalus root and Flos chrysanthemi indici (1:1:1), which had strong anti-NDV activity in vitro, were used to determine the in vivo inhibitory effects of NDV-infection in chickens. After treatment with the two formulations serum IgY titres against NDV were improved, and morbidity was reduced in the NDV-infected chickens. The results suggest that the components in formulations II and IV acted synergistically to improve resistance to Newcastle disease and provide a basis for the developing an anti-NDV herbal medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Veterinary Medicine , Northwest A&F University , Yangling , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Animal Facilities, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute , Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Lanzhou , China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c College of Chemistry and Biological Sciences , Yili Normal University , Yining , China."}], "LastName": "Brad", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Veterinary Medicine , Northwest A&F University , Yangling , China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Veterinary Medicine , Northwest A&F University , Yangling , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X-Y", "Initials": "XY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle disease virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26927474", "10.1080/00071668.2015.1119245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
