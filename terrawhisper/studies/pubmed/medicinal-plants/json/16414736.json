The analgesic activities of these extracts were compared with acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg/kg) which is used as a standard drug. Extracts were given orally in doses of 300, 500 and 1000 mg/kg. 0.9% saline was also administered in control group of animals. Results showed that four extracts were having highly significant analgesic activity at all the three doses tested. Three showed significant effects at higher doses while two extracts did not show any significant results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Karachi, Karachi-75270, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bingol", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sener", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16414736"]}}]}
