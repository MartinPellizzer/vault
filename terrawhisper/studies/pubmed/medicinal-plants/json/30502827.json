Roberty, Leptochloa uniflora Hochst, Pancratium triflorum Roxb and Molineria trichocarpa (Wight) N.P.Balakr against Culex quinquefasciatus.", "The larvicidal potential of selected plant extracts were determined against 4th instar larvae of C. quinquefasciatus with various concentrations viz., 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250\u2009mg/ml. The mortality counts were made after 24\u2009h of incubation and LC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated.", "Chloroform extracts of studied plants were showed highest larvicidal activity with remarkable irritant against the larva of C. quinquefasciatus. Highest larvicidal activity was observed in the chloroform extract of D. foveolatum against the larva of C. quinquefasciatus with LC50\u2009=\u2009277.03\u2009mg/ml. The larvicidal activity of the studied plants as follows chloroform extract of D. foveolatum (LC50\u2009=\u2009277.03\u2009mg/ml) >L. uniflora (LC50\u2009=\u2009300.56\u2009mg/ml) >M. trichocarpa (LC50\u2009=\u2009306.60\u2009mg/ml) >P. triflorum (LC50 318.42\u2009mg/ml). The larvicidal potential of P. triflorum was as follows Chloroform\u2009>\u2009acetone\u2009>\u2009methanol\u2009>\u2009petroleum ether. The larvicidal activities of L. uniflora and M. trichocarpa were as follows Chloroform\u2009>\u2009petroleum ether\u2009>\u2009acetone\u2009>\u2009methanol respectively.
