The use of anticancer agents inducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and controlling cell division might be a therapeutic approach to eradicate cancer cells. Herein, we examined the therapeutic effects of Auraptene on CT26 cells as well as on a mouse model of colorectal cancer (CRC). The spheroid assay was also conducted to analyze the anti-proliferative activity of Auraptene. We also assessed the in vitro analysis of ROS generation. The impact of Auraptene on oxidant/antioxidant markers, as well as the mRNA expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Nrf2, Cyclin D1, and Survivin genes, was evaluated by qPCR in tumor samples. As a result, Auraptene significantly reduced the size of CT26 spheroids at a dose of 200\u00a0\u00b5M. After 12\u00a0h, ROS levels were significantly elevated in CT26 cells. The administration of Auraptene induced apoptosis and the cell cycle arrest by modulating Bax, Bcl-2, Nrf2, Cyclin D1, and Survivin mRNA levels. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that Auraptene suppressed CAT, GSH (reduced Glutathione), and FRAP while increasing MDA in tissue homogenates which in turn could raise oxidative stress and stimulate apoptosis. Therefore, Auraptene may act as a powerful adjuvant therapy in CRC since it triggers apoptosis and cell cycle."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
