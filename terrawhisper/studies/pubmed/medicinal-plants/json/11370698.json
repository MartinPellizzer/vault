Documented pharmacological activities, including antidepressant, antiviral, and antibacterial effects, provide supporting evidence for several of the traditional uses stated for St John's wort. Many pharmacological activities appear to be attributable to hypericin and to the flavonoid constituents; hypericin is also reported to be responsible for the photosensitive reactions that have been documented for St. John's wort. With regard to the antidepressant effects of St John's wort, hyperforin, rather than hypericin as originally thought, has emerged as one of the major constituents responsible for antidepressant activity. Further research is required to determine which other constituents contribute to the antidepressant effect. Evidence from randomised controlled trials has confirmed the efficacy of St John's wort extracts over placebo in the treatment of mild-to-moderately severe depression. Other randomised controlled studies have provided some evidence that St John's wort extracts are as effective as some standard antidepressants in mild-to-moderate depression. There is still a need for further trials to assess the efficacy of St John's wort extracts, compared with that of standard antidepressants, particularly newer antidepressant agents, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (recent comparative studies with fluoxetine and sertraline have been conducted). Also, there is a need for further studies in well-defined groups of patients, in different types of depression, and conducted over longer periods in order to determine long-term safety. St John's wort does appear to have a more favourable short-term safety profile than do standard antidepressants, a factor that is likely to be important in patients continuing to take medication. Concerns have been raised over interactions between St John's wort and certain prescribed medicines (including warfarin, ciclosporin, theophylline, digoxin, HIV protease inhibitors, anticonvulsants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, triptans, oral contraceptives); advice is that patients taking these medicines should stop taking St John's wort, generally after seeking professional advice as dose adjustment of conventional treatment may be necessary."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Pharmacognosy & Phytotherapy, School of Pharmacy, University of London."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barnes", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillipson", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Seasonal Affective Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}], "NumberOfReferences": "172"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11370698", "10.1211/0022357011775910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
