The mobile system 0.3% ammonium carbonate solution-acetonitrile (75:25, v/v) with pH 7.5 was the optimal buffer to clearly separate aristolochic acids I, II within 20 min. The recovery of aristolochic acids I, II in medicinal plants and slimming products was better than 90% by extracting with methanol and purifying through a PHP-LH-20 column. The major component was aristolochic acid I in Aristolochia fangchi and the level ranged from 437 to 668 ppm. Aristolochic acid II was the major component for Aristolochia contorta and its range was <1-115 ppm. Twelve out of 16 samples of slimming pills and powders contained aristolochic acids I and/or II. The major component in most slimming products was aristolochic acid II and the level ranged from <1 to 148 ppm. It may indicate that slimming products were not mainly made of A. fangchi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, National Taiwan Ocean Univeristy, Keelung."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Tshung-Yei", "Initials": "TY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Lin", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Jou-Fang", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Deng-Fwu", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101139554", "ISSNLinking": "1570-0232"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94218WFP5T", "NameOfSubstance": "aristolochic acid I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Appetite Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11820292", "10.1016/s0378-4347(01)00416-9", "S0378-4347(01)00416-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
