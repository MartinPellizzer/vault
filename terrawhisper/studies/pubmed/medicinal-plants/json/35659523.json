Novel, effective, and plant-based pesticides are required to protect plants against TMV infection. To identify novel anti-TMV agents from natural sources, we systematically studied the roots of Cynanchum paniculatum and isolated six new seco-pregnane C<sub>21</sub> steroidal glycosides, along with 14 known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis. The anti-TMV activity of compounds were screened using the half-leaf method. Biological tests revealed that compounds 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 15, and 16 displayed significant anti-TMV activities compared with the positive control ningnanmycin. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis confirmed the antiviral activity of these compounds, as evident from reduced TMV coat protein (TMV-CP) gene replication and TMV-CP protein expression. These compounds downregulated the expression of NtHsp70-1 and NtHsp70-261, indicating that these steroidal glycosides possibly inhibit the TMV infection by suppressing the expression of NtHsp70-1 and NtHsp70-061 expression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
