This paper reports a study of its usage at Elcho Island, Northern Territory. At the high level of intake in this community, medical effects hitherto unreported are being observed. Some, such as a condition of detachment, reminiscent of the archetypal 'blissful indolence' of the lotus-eaters of Greek tradition as limned by the poet Homer, are obvious to the lay observer. Other effects are apparently advantageous for the management of alcohol abuse and some forms of psychosis. A surprising effect is the occurrence of a pellagrinous reaction. These observations indicate that further studies of the clinical effects and the human metabolism of high dosage kava are needed. Looming over all are questions of pharmacology. Do the kava pyrones possess anxiolytic or antipsychotic properties? Do they indeed have the property for which Pacific missionaries introduced them to Australia, as an alternative to alcoholism?"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cawte", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "0111052", "ISSNLinking": "0004-8674"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Alcoholism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceremonial Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotic Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Opinion"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3460587", "10.3109/00048678609158867"]}}]}
