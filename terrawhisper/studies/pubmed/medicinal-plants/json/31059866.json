One of these plants is Mitragyna speciosa, commonly referred to as Kratom. While traditional use of this plant was primarily for medicinal purposes, there has been a rise in its recreational use, and as a self-prescribed medication for opioid withdrawal. Although Kratom contains many alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are unique psychoactive biomarkers of the species, and are responsible for its psychoactive effects. A rapid validated method for the quantification of mitragynine in Kratom plant materials by direct analysis in real time-high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) is presented. It has a linear range of 5-100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL<sup>-1</sup>, and a lower limit of quantification of 5\u2009\u03bcg\u2009mL<sup>-1</sup>. The protocol was applied to determination of the mitragynine content of 16 commercially available Kratom plant products purchased online. The mitragynine amounts in these materials ranged from 2.76 to 20.05\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> of dried plant material. The utilization of DART-HRMS affords a mechanism not only for the preliminary identification of bulk plant material as being M. speciosa-derived (with no sample preparation required), but also provides the opportunity to quantify its psychoactive components using the same technique."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
