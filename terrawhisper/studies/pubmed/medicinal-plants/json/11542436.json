All cells were in the G1 phase at the beginning of germination and the duration of the first cell cycle was about 25 h. At 29 h, around 14% of the cortical nuclei were still in the G2 or M phases of the first cell cycle, whereas 53 and 33% of the nuclei were respectively in the G1 or S phase of the second cell cycle. In parallel, the cell cycle was analysed in root tips of lentil seedlings grown in space during the IML 2 mission (1994), (1) on the 1-g centrifuge for 29 h, (2) on the l-g centrifuge for 25 h and placed in microgravity for 4 h, (3) in microgravity for 29 h, (4) in microgravity for 25 h and placed on the 1-g centrifuge for 4 h. The densitometric analysis of nuclear DNA content showed that in microgravity there were less cells in DNA synthesis and more cells in G1 than in the controls on the 1-g centrifuge (flight and ground). The comparison of the sample grown continuously on the 1-g centrifuge in space and of the sample grown first in l-g and then in microgravity indicated that 4 h of microgravity modified cell cycle, increasing the percentage of cells in the G1 phase. On the contrary, the transfer from microgravity to the 1-g centrifuge (for 4 h) did not provoke any significant change in the distribution of the nuclear DNA content. Thus the effect of microgravity could not be reversed by a 4 h centrifugation. As the duration of the first cell cycle in the lentil root meristem is about 25 h, the results obtained are in agreement with the hypothesis that the first cell cycle and/or the second G1 phase was lengthened in absence of gravity. The difference observed in the distribution of the nuclear DNA content in the two controls could he due to the fact that the 1g control on board was subjected to a period of 15 min of microgravity for photography 25 h after the hydration of the seeds, which indicated an effect of short exposure to weightlessness. The mitotic index of cortical cells was greater on the 1-g centrifuge in space than in any other sample (flight and ground) which could show an effect of the centrifugation on the mitosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Cytologie Experimentale et Morphogenese Vegetale, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Driss-Ecole", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rembur", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legue", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perbal", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LGP81V5245", "NameOfSubstance": "Idoxuridine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Idoxuridine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11542436", "10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105125.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
