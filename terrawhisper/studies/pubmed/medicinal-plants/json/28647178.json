The potential of C.\u00a0sylvaticus as herbal medicine, the phytochemistry and pharmacological properties of its parts used as herbal medicines are reviewed. The extensive literature survey revealed that C.\u00a0sylvaticus is traditionally used to treat or manage at least 24 human and animal diseases and ailments. The species is used as herbal medicine for diseases and ailments such as abdominal pains, boils, fever, inflammation, malaria, rheumatism, swellings and tuberculosis and as ethnoveterinary medicine. Multiple classes of phytochemicals such as alkaloids, anthraquinones, essential oils, flavonoids, lignan, phenolics, sterols, tannins and terpenoids have been isolated from the species. Scientific studies on C.\u00a0sylvaticus indicate that it has a wide range of pharmacological activities which include antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, larvicidal and effects on the central nervous system. Although studies have confirmed that C.\u00a0sylvaticus has a wide range of bioactives, further research on the exact bioactive molecules and mechanisms of action are required."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
