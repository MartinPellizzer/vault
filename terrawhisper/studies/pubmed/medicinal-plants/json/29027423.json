However, the land must be given up after one season of R. glutinosa cultivation or replanted after a period of 8-10 years because of the severe continuous cropping obstacles. MicroRNAs is a class of endogenous non-coding small RNAs, which participate in regulation of physiological activities by target mRNA cleavage or translational repression in plants. In recent years,studies on the role of miRNAs in plants have made significant progresses,especially in medicinal plants\uff0eMiRNAs from some different medicinal plant species have been identified with regulatory effects\uff0eWhen plants are exposed to environmental stress, miRNAs act on stress-related genes and initiate stress-resistance mechanisms in the body against adverse factors. R. glutinosa is also a kind of environmental stress. It is conducive to deciphering the molecular mechanism of continuous cropping obstacles for us by researching miRNAs. This article reviews the production of miRNAs, mechanism, research approaches and characteristics of resisting the environmental stresses in plants, the development trends and future prospect of R. glutinosa miRNAs research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan University of Technology, Zhengzhou 450001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Fa-Jie", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ming-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Agriculture University, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng-Qing", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Henan Agriculture University, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xin-Jian", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yi", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29027423", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170217.007"]}}]}
