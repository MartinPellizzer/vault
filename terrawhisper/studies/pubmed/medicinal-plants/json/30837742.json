The elements were determined by ICP-MS DRC and CV-AAS using validated methods and QA/QC protocol. The interdependencies of 18 elements and 10 batches of mushrooms examined were tested with the help of principal component analysis.", "Some significant differences were found in the content and composition of minerals in marinated white button mushrooms depending on producer. Conserved white button mushrooms are poorer in major essential elements but also in toxic Hg, As, Ag, Cd, Sb, Tl or Pb which has been reported for unprocessed mushrooms.", "The relatively higher levels of Ag in some batches seem to be largely explained by the quality of the substrate used for mushrooms cultivation, while of Li, Rb, Cs, Cr, Al, U, V, As and Mn (in part also of Ba and Sr) largely by the quality of the marinade."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Gda\u0144sk, Environmental Chemistry & Ecotoxicology, 80-308 Gda\u0144sk, Poland"}], "LastName": "Pankavec", "ForeName": "Sviatlana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Adam Mickiewicz University, Department of Trace Element Analysis by Spectroscopy Method,\nUmultowska 89b, 61-614 Pozna\u0144, Poland"}], "LastName": "Han\u0107", "ForeName": "Anetta", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Adam Mickiewicz University, Department of Trace Element Analysis by Spectroscopy Method,\nUmultowska 89b, 61-614 Pozna\u0144, Poland"}], "LastName": "Bara\u0142kiewicz", "ForeName": "Danuta Bara\u0142kiewicz", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Gda\u0144sk, Environmental Chemistry & Ecotoxicology, 80-308 Gda\u0144sk, Poland"}], "LastName": "Dry\u017ca\u0142owska", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China"}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Gda\u0144sk, Environmental Chemistry & Ecotoxicology, 80-308 Gda\u0144sk, Poland"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Cartagena, Environmental and Computational Chemistry Group, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zaragocilla Campus, 130015 Cartagena, Colombia"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China"}], "LastName": "Falandysz", "ForeName": "Jerzy", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "UMO 2013/11 / N / NZ7 / 01240", "Agency": "National Science Centre of Poland", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig", "NlmUniqueID": "0414756", "ISSNLinking": "0035-7715"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30837742", "10.32394/rpzh.2019.0051"]}}]}
