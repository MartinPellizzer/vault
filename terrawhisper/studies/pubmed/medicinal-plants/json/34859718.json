Osteoclasts, the only multinucleated cells with bone resorption function, are derived from haematopoietic progenitors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. The regulation of osteoclast differentiation is considered an effective target for the treatment of bone-destructive diseases. Natural plant-derived products have received increasing attention in recent years due to their good safety profile, the preference of natural compounds over synthetic drugs, and their potential therapeutic and preventive activity against osteoclast-mediated bone-destructive diseases. In this study, we reviewed the research progress of the potential antiosteoclast active compounds extracted from medicinal plants and their molecular mechanisms. Active compounds from natural plants that inhibit osteoclast differentiation and functions include flavonoids, terpenoids, quinones, glucosides, polyphenols, alkaloids, coumarins, lignans, and limonoids. They inhibit bone destruction by downregulating the expression of osteoclast-specific marker genes (CTSK, MMP-9, TRAP, OSCAR, DC-STAMP, V-ATPase d2, and integrin av3) and transcription factors (c-Fos, NFATc1, and c-Src), prevent the effects of local factors (ROS, LPS, and NO), and suppress the activation of various signalling pathways (MAPK, NF-\u03baB, Akt, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Therefore, osteoclast-targeting natural products are of great value in the prevention and treatment of bone destructive diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Zhiyou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "JiaQiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xuqiang", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Drug Target", "NlmUniqueID": "9312476", "ISSNLinking": "1026-7158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Resorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone and Bones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteoclasts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34859718", "10.1080/1061186X.2021.2013488"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
