Pers. (Lauraceae) has long been used as a folk remedy in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Previous studies from our laboratory indicated that L. cubeba extract showed anti-arthritic activity in rats. Objective To study L. cubeba chemically and biologically and to find the potential constituents responsible for its anti-arthritic effect. Materials and methods The compounds were isolated from the root of L. cubeba by column chromatography which eluted with PE:EtOAc gradient system, and the structures were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic data analysis; the anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells and the TNF-\u03b1 and NO level were measured by ELISA (commercial kit); The iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression were measured by RT-PCR and the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, P38 and Akt were determined by western blots. Results A novel 9-fluorenone, 1-ethoxy-3,7-dihydroxy-4,6-dimethoxy-9-fluorenone (1), together with 4 known compounds, namely pinoresinol (2), syringaresinol (3), 9,9'-O-di-(E)-feruloyl-meso-5,5'-dimethoxysecoisolariciresinol (4) and lyoniresinol (5) were isolated from the root of L. cubeba for the first time. The IC50 for NO inhibition on compounds 1 and 4 were 56.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2 and 32.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. The IC50 for TNF-\u03b1 inhibition were 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 and 15.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0\u2009\u03bcM, respectively. Both 1 and 4 suppress mRNA expression of iNOS, COX-2 and protein phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b2 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Discussion and conclusion Compounds 1 and 4 isolated from L. cubeba exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity through the NF-\u03baB signal pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
