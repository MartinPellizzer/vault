Most of the studies are related to its chemistry and pharmacology, but the pathway involved in the biosynthesis of steroidal saponin is not much emphasized. Squalene epoxidase acts as a rate-limiting enzyme in this biosynthesis. In this study, we have selected root specific squalene epoxidase ArSQE from A. racemosus for its characterization. ArSQE was able to complement ergosterol auxotrophy in erg1 yeast mutants. Mutants were sensitive to the antifungal drug terbinafine, whereas ArSQE complementation made them tolerant to the same drug. ArSQE plays a significant role in early germination in transgenic tobacco. The transgenic tobacco seedlings overexpressing ArSQE were tolerant to terbinafine and abiotic stress. Expression analysis of transcripts in ArSQE transgenic lines suggests that it mostly affects ABA, GA, stress, and sterol related functions in transgenic tobacco. Further, root specific MeJA responsive A. racemosus bZIP transcription factors (TFs), ArTGA1 and ArTGA2, were identified that bind to MeJA responsive cis-element present in the promoter region of ArSQE. Characterization of ArSQE of A. racemosus provides new information about its regulation through MeJA responsive bZIP TF along with its role in the development and abiotic stress response in transgenic tobacco."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
