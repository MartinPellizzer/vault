The spectral data and physicochemical properties of the compounds were obtained from separation and compared with those of the compounds reported in the literature. As a result, 11 compounds isolated from the 90% ethanol extract of the stems and leaves of A. tonkinensis were identified as artocatonkine(1), 5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone(2), apigenin-4'-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside(3), rayalinol(4), psorachalcone A(5), 4-ketopinoresinol(6), ficusesquilignan B(7), pinnatifidanin AI(8), pinnatifidanin A(9), O-methylmellein(10), and trans-4-hydroxymellein(11). Among these compounds, compound 1 was a new prenylated flavone, and compounds 2-11 were isolated from the plants belonging to the genus Artocarpus for the first time. Furthermore, all compounds 1-11 were evaluated for their anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, and the MTS method was used to measure their inhibitory effects on the proliferation of synovioblasts in vitro. The results of activity evaluation showed that flavonoid compounds 1-3, 5, and lignan compounds 8 and 9 displayed significant anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, showing the IC_(50) values in inhibiting the proliferation of synovioblasts MH7A from(6.38\u00b10.06) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1) to(168.58\u00b10.28)\u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jia-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lin-Xuan", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin-Yi", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tian-Yu", "Initials": "TY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "En-Ning", "Initials": "EN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Long-Cheng", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Research and Development of Tropical Fruit and Vegetable of Haikou City, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Haikou City, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Research and Development of Tropical Fruit and Vegetable of Haikou City, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Artocarpus tonkinensis"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artocarpus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041125", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240405.203"]}}]}
