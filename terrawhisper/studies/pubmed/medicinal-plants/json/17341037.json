The flavonoid baicalein was found as an active component in the extract. Analysis of freeze-dried fruits of the plant indicated that this component comprised about 4% of the material by dry weight. In this study, we investigated the in vitro effects of baicalein on the viability and induction of apoptosis in the HL-60 cell line. The cell viability after treating with baicalein for 24 h was quantified by counting viable cells using trypan blue staining. The results showed that baicalein caused a 50% inhibition of HL-60 cells at concentrations of 25-30 microM. The inhibition of proliferation of HL-60 cells due to 36-48 h exposure to 10 or 20 microM baicalein was associated with the accumulation of cells at S or G2M phases. However, proliferation inhibition at a higher dose may be associated with induction by apoptosis, as evidenced by the typical nuclear fragmentation using DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The results indicate that baicalein has anti-tumor effects on human cancer cells, and Oroxylum indicum extract could be used in supplementary cancer therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Food Research InstituteFood Function Laboratory, Tsukuba, Japan. mkroy@affrc.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "M Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakahara", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Na", "ForeName": "Thalang V", "Initials": "TV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trakoontivakorn", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takenaka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isobe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsushida", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Situ Nick-End Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17341037"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
