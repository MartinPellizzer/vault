Ultrastructural parameters revealed that acute hypoxia deteriorated the morphologic condition of the diabetic cardiomyocytes: volume fractions of sarcoplasm, t-tubules, mitochondria, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and degenerative intramitochondrial areas increased after hypoxia, those of myofibrils and mitochondrial cristae decreased. Since these alterations are more striking than after hypoxia of non-diabetic animals as demonstrated in preceding studies, we regard them as indicative for reduced hypoxia tolerance of the diabetic myocardium. EGb-treatment of the diabetic animals could improve the above mentioned parameters thus indicating a gradual improvement of the hypoxia tolerance. The biochemical parameters of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase) were decreased after hypoxia in the diabetic myocardium but increased after EGb-pretreatment. The ultrastructural damage by hypoxia and its prevention by EGb should be regarded rather as a consequence of ATP--and energy deficiency and breakdown of membrane functions and--structure resp. as membrane stabilizing and enzyme-regulating effects of EGb than as radical-related events. The hypoxia-induced deprivation of creatine kinase activity of the diabetic myocardium was not prevented by EGb-treatment. Immunohistochemical demonstration of iNOS expression was strongest in the unprotected diabetic myocardium, absent after additional hypoxia and in the controls, and very weak in the protected hypoxic specimens. Transcription of iNOS as demonstrated by RT-PCR was present in few diabetic, some of the hypoxic diabetic, in most of the EGb-treated hypoxic diabetic, and in all control animals. EGb-treatment seems to improve the hypoxia tolerance of diabetic myocardium concerning ultratructural parameters. The partly conflicting immunohistochemical and biochemical results require further investigations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Leipzig, Germany. fitzig@medizin.uni-leipzig.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fitzl", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welt", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dettmer", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hermsdorf", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clemens", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Konig", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Exp Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "9208920", "ISSNLinking": "0940-2993"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11089893", "10.1016/S0940-2993(00)80075-5", "S0940-2993(00)80075-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
