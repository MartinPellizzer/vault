Hence, this study sought to identify EHH via an integrated approach comprising data from its morphological evaluation, HPLC analysis, comparative plastomes analysis and allele-specific PCR identification. First, the morphological characteristics of 8 subgenus Chamaesyce plants were summarized. Then, HPLC analysis showed that 18 batches of EHH were adulterated or unqualified. Furthermore, the plastomes of the 8 subg. Chamaesyce species were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a sister relationship among the 8 subg. Chamaesyce species. The allele-specific PCR authentication was developed by the nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (InDels) analysis. The results of allele-specific PCR showed that 27 batches of EHH were adulterated, indicating that the superior sensitivity of molecular authentication over the other methods used. This study provided a reference for rational use and phylogenetic research of EHH."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
