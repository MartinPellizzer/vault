Existing treatments for RA mainly focus on the use of immunomodulators and the suppression of synovial inflammation, and many have significant side effects. Medicinal plants are regarded as important alternative sources for treating RA.", "This review summarizes the bioactive compounds of medicinal plants, which have been shown to modulate the immune response by regulating interleukins in vitro and in vivo experimental models, and that may be promising substances for use in the treatment of RA.", "Articles on natural products used for the management of arthritis were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science through electronic and manual search in English. In total, 576 publications were identified, and 34 were included in this systematic review.", "Two articles presented findings on the role of natural components in the treatment of arthritis in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Nine reports defined the role of plant-derived natural molecules in the treatment of arthritis using cell lines, and 27 in vivo studies assessed the anti-arthritic efficacy and immunomodulation effects of phytoconstituents on interleukin production and inflammatory responses.", "This systematic review broadly reports that, in contrast to other classes of phytochemicals, flavonoids have the greatest therapeutic potential against arthritis by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17, as well as anti-inflammatory IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines, through the suppression of dynamic inflammatory biomarkers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
