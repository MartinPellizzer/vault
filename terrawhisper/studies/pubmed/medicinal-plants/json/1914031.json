A clinical prospective trial was conducted to evaluate its effect in comparison with the Captopril. 30 cases with initial Scr level of 344.8 +/- 114.0 mumol/L were allocated randomly to 3 groups. Rheum E treated group, Captopril treated group and Rheum E + Captopril group. The long term (6-22 mos) follow-up results showed that the progression rate of renal failure, calculated by regression analysis of 1/Scr vs time, was found to be retarded after treatment, being more marked in both Rheum E and Rheum E + Captopril group. Uremic symptoms improved after the treatment with serum albumin level increased. To explore the mechanism of therapeutic effects of Rheum on CRF, a series of experimental studies were performed. Rheum can suppress the proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells in culture. In 5/6 nephrectomized rats, the O2 consumption of remnant kidney was obviously decreased by feeding the animal Rheum E and the hypermetabolic state was ameliorated as well. A group of 5/6 nephrectomized rats were fed with Rheum E for 28 wks. It was found that the level of azotemia of this treated group was lessened remarkably as compared with the controls. The serum albumin and transferrin contents of the treated animals were much higher than the controls while the blood cholesterol and triglycerides decreased unexpectedly. In conclusion, both the in vivo and in vitro studies have proved the effectiveness of Rheum in preventing the progression of CRF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinling Hospital, Nanjing."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "L S", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Z H", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G64RSX1XD", "NameOfSubstance": "Captopril"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Captopril"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Glomerular Mesangium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1914031"]}}]}
