In this experimental model of mitochondrial myopathy, as in many human mitochondrial diseases, there is a random distribution of COX negative fibers. Some fibers are completely COX negative while others are partially negative and others are completely positive. In the present work we have studied the distribution of COX negative mitochondria at transmission electron microscopy in skeletal muscle of rats in this experimental myopathy. In myofibers of intoxicated animals the expression of COX was heterogeneous. The histochemical reaction was observed in the internal membrane (more evident in mitochondrial cristae) of all mitochondria of some myofibers, while it was almost absent in other myofibers. In these myofibers the great part of the mitochondria were negative for COX reaction while other ones had a weak expression of this enzyme (dot or focal expression of COX). Our results indicated that the COX mitochondrial activity is heterogeneously impaired in myofibers of rats intoxicated with S. occidentalis. These abnormalities remember those observed in some types of human mitochondrial myopathies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Department, Biomedical Institute, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calore", "ForeName": "N M P", "Initials": "NM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calore", "ForeName": "E E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sesso", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Correia", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marcondes", "ForeName": "M C S L", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vilela de Almeida", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "8804312", "ISSNLinking": "1122-9497"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome-c Oxidase Deficiency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondrial Myopathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Fibers, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12117285"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
