Terminalia ferdinandiana is a traditional medicinal plant, endemic to Australia and is a rich source of many bioactive phytochemicals such as ellagic acid (EA) with known antioxidant capacity. Methods We investigated the in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of an aqueous food grade EA enriched (EAE) extract of T. ferdinandiana. Caco-2 and KERTr cell lines were treated with EAE or pure EA (used as reference control), followed by the exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and gene expression of molecular markers associated with oxidative stress and inflammation were monitored. Results Significant reduction in ROS production was observed in both cell types treated with 100 or 200\u2006\u00b5g/mL EA or EAE. Treatment of cells with EAE or EA showed upregulation of mRNA expression of the antioxidative gene superoxide dismutase (SOD)-2 and downregulated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), soluble cell adhesion molecule (sICAM), and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Neither EAE nor EA had any effect on the constitutively expressed COX1. Conclusions The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of T. ferdinandiana extract on mammalian cells exposed to H2O2 suggests the potential of using this traditional medicinal plant in preventing oxidative damage and inflammation related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland, Block 10, Level 1, 39 Kessels Rd, Coopers Plains Qld 4108, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Chaliha", "ForeName": "Mridusmita", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland, Block 10, Level 1, 39 Kessels Rd, Coopers Plains Qld 4108, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sultanbawa", "ForeName": "Yasmina", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caco-2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terminalia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31343981", "10.1515/jcim-2019-0008", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2019-0008/jcim-2019-0008.xml"]}}]}
