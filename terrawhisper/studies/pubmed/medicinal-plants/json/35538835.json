However, until now no specific drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found. This prompted many researchers to explore compounds as anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidates. One of the efforts to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus is to increase the body's immune system (immune). Medicinal plants are known to have the ability as immune-modulators, one of which is Betel leaf (Piper betle L.) which has good activity as antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-viral with other pharmacological effects. An in silico approach in drug development was used to search for potential antiviral compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Protein, RBD, and Non-structural Protein (NSP15).", "This study aimed to determine the potential of Betel leaf compounds as immunemodulators and good inhibitory pathways against COVID-19.", "In this study, a potential screening of steroid class compounds, namely 24- propilcholesterol was carried out as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate, using an in silico approach with molecular docking simulations for three receptors that play an important role in COVID-19, namely Mpro SARS-CoV-2, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and a non-structural protein (NSP15) and were compared with Azithromycin, Favipiravir and Ritonavir as positive controls.", "Based on the results of molecular docking simulations, compound from Betel leaf, 24- Propylcholesterol, showed high binding affinity values for spike glycoprotein RBD and nonstructural protein 15 (NSP15), namely -7.5 and -7.8 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, a native ligand of Mpro, inhibitor N3, has a higher binding affinity value than 24-propylcholesterol -7.4 kcal/mol.", "24-Propylcholesterol compound predicted to have potential as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound. However, it is necessary to carry out in vitro and in vivo studies to determine the effectiveness of the compound as an anti-SARS-CoV-2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Kurnia", "ForeName": "Dikdik", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Wiani", "ForeName": "Ika", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Zainuddin", "ForeName": "Achmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Windaryanti", "ForeName": "Devi", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Universitas Padjadjaran, Sumedang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Sondang Gabriel", "ForeName": "Christine", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunomodulating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunomodulating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35538835", "10.2174/1386207325666220509184838", "CCHTS-EPUB-123261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
