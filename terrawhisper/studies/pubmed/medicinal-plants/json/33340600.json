Various approaches have been used to eradicate the menace of biofilm. Ethnomedicinal plants as potent antibiofilm agents are gaining a lot of interest in an era where the drug resistance is increasing and the availability of potent antibiotics is no longer promised. In this context, the methanol extract of Cuphea carthagenensis (CCMD), an ethno-medicinal and culinary herb, was evaluated as an antibiofilm and anti-QS agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.", "The aim of the study is to evaluate the antibiofilm and anti-QS activity of an ethnomedicinal plant against a strong biofilm forming microorganism, P. aeruginosa.", "Antibiofilm activity of CCMD was demonstrated at different concentrations by Tissue Culture Plate, Test Tube method and other microscopic techniques. The effect of CCMD on QS and QS-related virulence factors viz. Pyocyanin, exopolymeric substance matrix (EPS), total protease, elastase, pyoverdin and swimming motility in P. aeruginosa were also evaluated. Antioxidant activity (DPPH & FRAP), total phenolic and flavonoid content were also checked. In order to determine the composition of the extract HPLC analysis was also performed.", "In vitro study demonstrated a significant inhibition of biofilm formation (81.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.57%) as well as production of QS-dependent virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. The extract also inhibited violacein production (83.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.77%) in Chromobacterium violaceum which correlates with the reduction in QS-mediated virulence factors. The extract showed 64.79%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83% DPPH scavenging activity and reduction of ferricyanide complex (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) to the ferrous form (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in DPPH and FRAP assay, respectively. Furthermore, the extract showed thermal stability and does not have any growth inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa. The HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of ellagic acid, ascorbic acid and hippuric acid in the extract.", "This work is the first to demonstrate that C. carthagenensis can attenuate biofilm formation and QS-mediated virulence factors of P. aeruginosa. Further investigation is required to use this ethnomedicinal plant (CCMD) as an important source of antibiofilm agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
