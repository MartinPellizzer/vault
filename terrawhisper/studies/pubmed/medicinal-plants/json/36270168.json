In aqueous solution, the nucleophilic addition of HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (as SO<sub>2</sub> donor) to MIB blocked its long-range \u03c0-conjugation and ICT process and resulted in significant optical signal changes (blue-shifted UV absorbance and fluorescence), which enabled colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent detection of HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> with high selectivity and sensitivity (detection limit of 63.15\u00a0nM). MIB offers obvious advantages of good water-solubility, fast response time (within 1\u00a0min), unique dual lysosome/mitochondria targeting capability and has been applied to the sensing of endogenous and exogenous SO<sub>2</sub> in live cells through fluorescent imaging<sub>.</sub> In addition, the proposed probe has been utilized for the determination of bisulfite in real water, food and herbal medicine samples, showing good recovery (91.45\u00a0% - 109.3\u00a0%) and precision."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
