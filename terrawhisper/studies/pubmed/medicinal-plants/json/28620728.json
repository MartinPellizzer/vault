In this study, heavy metals in Epimedii Folium, an edible medicinal plant in China, were quantitatively analyzed. Variations of heavy metals in different species, in various organs (i.e., leaves, stems, and roots), in wild-growing and cultivated plants, and in 35 market samples of Epimedii Folium, were systematically investigated. In all of Epimedium samples, Hg (mercury) was not detectable (0.00\u00a0\u03bcg/g). Four species, Epimedium pubescens, Epimedium sagittatum, Epimedium brevicornu, and Epimedium wushanense, were found to contain Cu (copper) and Pb (lead). And contents of Cu and Pb in E. brevicornu were significantly higher than those in other species (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In wild-growing and cultivated Epimedium plants, Cd (cadmium) and As (arsenic) were not detectable, and concentrations of Cu and Pb in wild-growing plants were significantly higher than those in cultivated plants (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Cd was not detectable in leaves, roots, and stems, while organ specificity was apparent in the distribution of Cu, As, and Pb. And the highest levels of Cu and Pb were observed in roots and leaves, respectively. In Chinese markets, several samples of Epimedii Folium contained excessive Cu, Cd, As, and Pb beyond the national permissible limits. In summary, there was a large variation of heavy metals among Epimedii Folium samples, and Cu and Pb were the most important heavy metals contaminating the edible medicinal plant. Application of Epimedii Folium to drug and food industries will need to focus more on toxic heavy metal contamination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Trace Elements and Endemic Diseases of Ministry of Health, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hua", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Center of Shaanxi Province for Food and Health Sciences, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710062, People's Republic of China. isaacsau@sohu.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University, Wuhan Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430074, People's Republic of China. isaacsau@sohu.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hua-Feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Joint Research Center of Shaanxi Province for Food and Health Sciences, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710062, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Li-Li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate University, Wuhan Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, 430074, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Trace Elements and Endemic Diseases of Ministry of Health, Health Science Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710061, People's Republic of China. laijh1011@mail.xjtu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Jiang-Hua", "Initials": "JH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GK201703076, 2016CSZ008", "Agency": "Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities in China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2014SJ-01, 2014SJ-08, 2016SF-350", "Agency": "Project of Science & Technology in Shaanxi Province", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28620728", "10.1007/s12011-017-1075-2", "10.1007/s12011-017-1075-2"]}}]}
