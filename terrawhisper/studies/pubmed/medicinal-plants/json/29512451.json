For the prevention and treatment of cancer, herbal remedies have played a significant role. In this review, we have summarized medicinal herbs from the entire world, including India, that are used traditionally for various cancer treatment. Whenever we talk about cancer treatment, medicinal plants always have been on the priority.", "In this article, we have summarized the flora used in earlier times and recently identified for pre-clinical anticancer treatment. The present paper is a comprehensive review of different literature sources with discussion being made on the therapeutic value of diverse medicinal herbs in the treatment of various kinds of cancer by using different in vitro cancer cell lines. Countless anticancer plants have been recognized with the help of innovative techniques including isolation and structure elucidation that implement their beneficial effect by increasing the immunity of the body, inducing antioxidant action, endorsing making of shielding enzymes, hindering cancer triggering enzymes and hormones, and exciting DNA restoration mechanism.", "Finally, we have concluded that Argemone mexicana shows maximum anti-cancer activity on various cancer cell lines in comparison to other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Hail, Hail, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Dasauli, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Talib", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Dasauli, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Bajpai", "ForeName": "Shrestha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences , College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of Hail, Hail, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Hail, Hail, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Moin", "ForeName": "Afrasim", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Hail, Hail, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alafnan", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Integral University, Dasauli, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, 226026, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Moazzam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Enzymoics, 7 Peterlee Place, Hebersham, NSW 2770, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Novel Global Community Educational Foundation, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kamal", "ForeName": "Mohammad Amjad", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ganash", "ForeName": "Magdah", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "Ghulam Md", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29512451", "10.2174/1389200219666180305144841", "CDM-EPUB-88905"]}}]}
