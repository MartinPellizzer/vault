At present, effectively reducing ammonia emissions or recovering ammonia is still a huge challenge. Ionic liquids (ILs) as a new class of green solvent have been introduced for ammonia absorption with great potential, but a huge number on combination systems of ILs lead to the difficulty of measuring the ammonia solubility in all ILs by experiments (e.g., danger and cost). Hereby, this study proposed a novel approach for estimating the ammonia solubility in different ILs. A predictive model was developed based on the novel Algorithm - extreme learning machine (ELM) and the molecular descriptors of electrostatic potential surface areas (S<sub>EP</sub>) as input parameters. Besides, 502 data points of ammonia solubility in 17 ILs were gathered with a wide range of pressure and temperature. For the total set, the determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) and the average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of the developed model were 0.9937 and 2.95%, respectively. The regression plots revealed good consistency between predictive and experimental data points. Results show the good performance and reliability of the developed model, indicating that the proposed approach can be potentially applied for screening reasonable ILs to absorb ammonia from chemical industry processes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
