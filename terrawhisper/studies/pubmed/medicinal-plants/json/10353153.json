The influence of the drug, Semecarpus anacardium Linn. nut extract, on hepatocarcinogenicity of aflatoxin B1 was evaluated in adult albino male Wistar rats. Aflatoxin B1 was administered intraperitoneally to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. These cancer bearing animals were treated with Semecarpus anacardium Linn. nut extract (200 mg/kg body weight/day) in sunflower oil orally for 14 days. The plasma and the liver tumour tissue were investigated biochemically for lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. The elevation of plasma concentration of these enzymes were indicative of the persistent deteriorating effect of aflatoxin B1 in cancer bearing animals. Lactate dehydrogenase and aminotransferases levels were decreased in liver, whereas alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were increased in cancer conditions. These enzyme levels were reversed to near normal control values in drug treated animals. The analysis of marker enzyme activities clearly indicates the antitumour efficacy of Semecarpus anacardium Linn. nut extract on aflatoxin B1 induced hepatocellular carcinoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Dr. A.L.M.
