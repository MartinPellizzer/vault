The PCOS group (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200994) was identified according to the Rotterdam criteria. The Control group (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u200968) included age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy volunteers. Serum levels of adipocytokines were measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and ACE genes were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCOS group, when compared to the Control group had lower adiponectin (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.001) but higher visfatin (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.001) and apelin (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u2009.003). There was no significant correlation of the levels of these adipocytokines with BMI, fasting glucose, fasting insulin or Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). The PCOS and the Control groups also differed with regard to the ACE ID genotype distribution (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u2009.001). The ID, DD, and II genotype frequencies were, respectively, 34, 57 and 9% in the PCOS group and 49, 22 and 29% in the Control group. When stratified according to individual ID genotypes, the levels of adipocytokines in the PCOS and the Control groups remained significantly different. There was no statistically significant relationship between the levels of adipocytokines and ACE ID genotypes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5988-4969"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "O\u017cegowska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8347-0512"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Experimental Pharmacogenetics, Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Biopharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bartkowiak-Wieczorek", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Experimental Pharmacogenetics, Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Biopharmacy, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bogacz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5660-2893"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Perinatology and Women's Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1419-6502"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Department of Reproductive Medicine, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA."}], "LastName": "Duleba", "ForeName": "Antoni J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3309-3269"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Pawelczyk", "ForeName": "Leszek", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Gynecol Endocrinol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807913", "ISSNLinking": "0951-3590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adipokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.15.1", "NameOfSubstance": "ACE protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.15.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Adipokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "INDEL Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Thinness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31814467", "10.1080/09513590.2019.1695248"]}}]}
