Semen samples were collected from Simmental breed bulls via the artificial vagina and pooled. After dividing into five groups, control (C: no additive) and four different P (200, 100, 50, and 25 \u03bcg/mL) groups, the final concentration was diluted to 16\u00d7106 per straw. Semen samples were equilibrated at 4\u00b0C for approximately 4 hours, then placed in French straws and frozen. After thawing, sperm motility and kinetic parameters, DNA integrity by single-cell gel electrophoresis, sperm abnormalities by liquid fixation, and lipid peroxidation levels by the colorimetric method was analyzed by Computer-Assisted Semen Analyzer. P added to the diluent showed no effect on motility and kinetic parameters at P25 and P50 (p>0.05), while P100 and P200 had a negative effect (p\u27e80.001). The addition of P (25 and 50) showed a treatment effect on tail abnormality compared to C (p\u27e80.05). Especially P50 had a positive effect on tail length, tail DNA, and tail movement, while P100 and P200 caused DNA damage (p\u27e80.001). MDA levels increased in all P dose groups compared to C (p\u27e80.001). This study has clearly demonstrated that P25 and P50 supplements could be used therapeutically to treat sperm tail abnormalities and prevent DNA damage in post-thawed bull sperm."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Polish Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Reproduction and Artificial Insemination, Afyon Kocatepe University, Ahmet Necdet Sezer Campus, 03200, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yeni", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Vocational School of Technical Sciences, Aksaray University, Hacilar Harman\u0131 Street, 12.
