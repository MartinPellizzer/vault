(mistletoe) extracts and mistletoe lectins were studied by light and electron microscopy. The first events observed were membrane perforation and protrusions typical for apoptosis. Inhibition of Molt 4 cell growth was obtained with lectin concentrations in the pg/ml range as long as cells were cultured in serum-free medium. Under this condition, mistletoe lectin-III was about 10 times more cytotoxic than mistletoe lectin-I; mistletoe lectin-II was in between. Lectin cytotoxicity was modulated by human serum from donors who had never been treated with mistletoe preparations and lectin-specific carbohydrates, added at the mmol/l range, particularly D-galactose (or beta-lactose) for mistletoe lectin-I and N-acetyl-galactosamine for mistletoe lectin-II and -III. In addition, at subtoxic concentrations, mistletoe lectin-I, -II and -III enhanced the production of cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha) by isolated human monocytes. The experimental results are discussed in relation to the treatment of cancer patients administered with mistletoe extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Pharmacognosie, Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg, Illkirch, France."}], "LastName": "Rib\u00e9reau-Gayon", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Frantz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anton", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "9100823", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}], "NumberOfReferences": "20"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9179359", "10.1097/00001813-199704001-00002"]}}]}
