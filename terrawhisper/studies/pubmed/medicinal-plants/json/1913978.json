Sandw. on the basis of bioactivity-guided fractionation and confirmed to mediate a potent cytotoxic response with cultured P-388 cells. We presently report a detailed isolation procedure and the results of studies designed to examine its mechanism of action. By means of a Michael-type addition, stizophyllin formed adducts with nucleophilic substances such as L-cysteine and beta-mercaptoethanol. The adduct with beta-mercaptoethanol was isolated, structurally characterized, and found to be 20-fold less cytotoxic than stizophyllin. Stizophyllin interacted with DNA, but no mutagenicity was observed with Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677 or cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and no in vitro reaction occurred with guanosine. Relative to control cell cultures, the total biosynthesis of DNA, RNA or protein was reduced when P-388 cells were treated with stizophyllin. However, the cell number did not increase in the presence of inhibitory stizophyllin concentrations (e.g., 4 micrograms/ml), and the DNA content (per cell) actually doubled after approximately 48 h. Consistent with this, stizophyllin blocked the cells in the G2 + M compartment of the cycle, and the block appeared to be specific for the G2 phase. Accordingly, stizophyllin did not modulate in vitro tubulin polymerization reactions nor did it affect the morphology of dibutyryl cAMP-treated astrocytoma cells in culture. These data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of stizophyllin is mediated by covalent reaction with a cellular component (such as a sulfhydryl-containing protein) by means of a Michael-type addition. Based on the cell-cycle specificity of the response, it appears that this interaction prevents the cells from progressing through mitosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612."}], "LastName": "Duh", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kinghorn", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 CA33047", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pregnatrienes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tubulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "109237-00-5", "NameOfSubstance": "stizophyllin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Astrocytoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia P388"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnatrienes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tubulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1913978", "10.1016/0009-2797(91)90030-b", "0009-2797(91)90030-B"]}}]}
