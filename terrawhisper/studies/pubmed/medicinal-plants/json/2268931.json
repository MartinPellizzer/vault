Coli in dogs. The experimental results indicated that the survival rate at 48 h after intravenous injection of live E. Coli was 30% in saline group, 80% in GAB, 90% in dexamethasone (Dex) group. The BPC, WBC, FG, AT-III, beta-GC, PHb were 82 +/- 28, 9.1 +/- 5.9, 1.85 +/- 0.41, 112 +/- 43, 0.37 +/- 0.17, 0.11 +/- 0.07 respectively for GAB, 70 +/- 37, 6.7 +/- 3.7, 1.55 +/- 0.36, 59 +/- 29, 0.91 +/- 0.28, 0.12 +/- 0.06 respectively for the saline group, 58 +/- 33, 6.3 +/- 2.9, 1.95 +/- 0.21, 103 +/- 43, 0.50 +/- 0.16, 0.13 +/- 0.06 respectively for Dex. The BPC, WBC, FG, AT-III levels of the GAB group were significantly higher than those in saline group and were not significantly difference from the Dex group. The beta-GC and PHb levels of the GAB group were significantly reductive than the saline group and were not significantly different from the Dex group. The results showed that the survival rate was higher, the DIC was inhibited and normal biomembranes were maintained in the GAB group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Hunan College of TCM, Changsha."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Y Y", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8207427", "ISSNLinking": "0254-9034"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S5I7G3JQL", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexamethasone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dexamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Septic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2268931"]}}]}
