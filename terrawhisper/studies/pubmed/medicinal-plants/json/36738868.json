All of nine compounds exhibited cytotoxic activities against the three cancer cell lines, with compound D4 exhibiting potent cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells and was better than positive control. Herein, we further evaluated the effect of compound D4 on HeLa cells. The results revealed that compound D4 has excellent cytotoxic effect on HeLa cells by inhibiting cell colony formation and migration, promoting cell apoptosis, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and arresting of HeLa cells in S and G2/M phases. These findings encourage further work on the chemistry and bioactivity of the Bufo viridis toad venom."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
