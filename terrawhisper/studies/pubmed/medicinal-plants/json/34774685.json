In traditional medicine, Calanthe species provide remedies against various conditions such as arthritis, rheumatism, traumatic injuries, snake-bites, abdominal discomfort, nose bleeding, common colds, ulcers, chronic coughs, and others. Some species are also used as aphrodisiacs, tonics, and as pain relievers on joints and toothaches.", "This review provides comprehensive information on the herbal uses, chemical components, pharmacological activities, and conservation of Calanthe, which might be useful in the future development of potent herbal medicines and facilitate the enactment of better conservation strategies.", "Relevant information was obtained from online databases including SCI-Finder, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, PubMed, Springer, IOP Science, and other web sources such as PubChem, The Plant List, and World Flora Online. Books, Ph.D. and MSc dissertations were used for unpublished literature. Information from Chinese literature was obtained from the CNKI database.", "In total, 19 species of the genus Calanthe have been reported to be used in traditional medicine in different countries of Asia. A total of 265 chemical compounds from different chemical classes including, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolic compounds and phenolic derivatives, phenanthrenes, and others, have been identified from Calanthe species. Calanquinone A isolated from C. arisanensis has been reported to exhibit antitumor activity against six malignant cell lines. Other bioactive compounds from Calanthe with pharmacological activity include phenanthrenes, phenanthrenequinones, 6'-O-\u03b2-D-apiofuranosylindican, 4H-Pyran-4one, 2, 3-dihydro-3,5 dihydroxy-6-methyl, and calanthoside. These compounds exhibit valuable biological properties such as hair restoration, anticancer activity, anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activity, antidiabetic and hepatoprotective potency, antiplatelet aggregation action, and antibacterial and antifungal activities. Some Calanthe species, including C. ecallosa and C. yuana, are endangered in the IUCN red list. The high risk of extinction is attributed to illegal trade and unsustainable harvesting and utilization.", "This review summarizes the herbal uses, chemical components, biological activity, and conservation of Calanthe. The pharmacological studies on this genus are limited; thus, extensive research on the toxicology, pharmaceutical standardization, and mechanism of action of the isolated bioactive compounds are needed. Since some species of Calanthe are listed as endangered, stringent guidelines on trade, collection, and sustainable utilization of medicinal orchids should be set up to facilitate the conservation of these species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
