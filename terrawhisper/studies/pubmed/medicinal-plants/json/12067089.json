It is also of significance in new drug development based on the mechanism of Chinese medicine. A key step towards this task is the determination of the therapeutic and toxicity protein targets of CMP compounds. In this work, newly developed computer software INVDOCK is used for automated identification of potential therapeutic and toxicity targets of several bioactive compounds isolated from Chinese medicinal plants. This software searches a protein database to find proteins to which a CMP compound can bind or weakly bind. INVDOCK results on three CMP compounds (allicin, catechin and camptotecin) show that 60% of computer-identified potential therapeutic protein targets and 27% of computer-identified potential toxicity targets have been implicated or confirmed by experiments. This software may potentially be used as a relatively fast-speed and low-cost tool for facilitating the study of molecular mechanism and pharmacology of bioactive compounds from Chinese medicinal plants and natural products from other sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore. yzchen@cz3.nus.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Y Z", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ung", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XT3Z54Z28A", "NameOfSubstance": "Camptothecin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Camptothecin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predictive Value of Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12067089", "10.1142/S0192415X02000156", "S0192415X02000156"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
