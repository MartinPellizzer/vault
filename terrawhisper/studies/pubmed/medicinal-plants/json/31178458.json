The oils from the aerial parts (flower, leaf and stem) were obtained by Clevenger-type apparatus and characterized by GC-FID and GC-MS. While tricosane (21.67%) was the main component of flower oil, hexadecanoic acid was the most abundant component of leaf and stem oils in ratios 26.46% and 31.89%, respectively. Additionally, all essential oils of G. gelida were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against eight Gram negative bacteria, four Gram positive bacteria and five fungi, using agar dilution method and antioxidant activities by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and Folin-Ciocalteu assays. The flower oil of G. gelida showed stronger antimicrobial and antioxidant activities than those of stem and leaf. The amount of total phenolic content and scavenging activity of the flower oil were found 525.35\u00b18.24 mg GAE/L and 49.30\u00b11.25%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane University."}], "LastName": "\u00dc\u00e7\u00fcnc\u00fc", "ForeName": "Osman", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane University."}], "LastName": "Karata\u015f", "ForeName": "\u015eeyda Merve", "Initials": "\u015eM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane University."}], "LastName": "Baltac\u0131", "ForeName": "Cemalettin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Programme of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Espiye Vocational School, Giresun University."}], "LastName": "Karak\u00f6se", "ForeName": "Mustafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Karadeniz Technical University."}], "LastName": "T\u00fcrku\u00e7ar", "ForeName": "Semra Alkan", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gentianaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31178458", "10.5650/jos.ess18113"]}}]}
