This review examines which herbal medicines show to be effective to treat atopic dermatitis, diaper dermatitis, and skin lesions or wounds.", "Clinical studies were searched according to PRISMA-guidelines in the medical databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL and summarised in a systematic review.", "Among the 429 articles screened, 17 studies with a total of 2358 participants were identified that suited our inclusion criteria. Thereof seven studies each on the treatment of atopic dermatitis and skin lesions or wounds and three on diaper dermatitis. The phytotherapeutics investigated were based on the following herbs: Evening primrose, blackcurrant, polypodium leucotomos, calendula, aloe vera, chamomile, comfrey, hamamelis, olive, hypericum, neem, white oak, and myrrh. They have mainly been analysed in randomized controlled trials, but also in (long-term) observational studies, prospective trials and case series.", "Based on the application of the Jadad score, eight out of 17 of the studies examined were of low quality. Yet we found some indication that evening primrose oil may be effective for treating atopic dermatitis in children, while comfrey appears to have a positive effect on wound healing. Interestingly, none of the studies found positive effects for treating skin disorders with aloe vera or chamomile."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
