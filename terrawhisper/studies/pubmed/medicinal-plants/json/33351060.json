The appropriate mobile phase combination of toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (7:2.5:0.5, v/v/v) were developed to expand the plates which separated components according to the marker compounds. Further, the anti-oxidant potential of methanol extract of R. communis (MERC) and E. hirta (MERH) were also assessed with 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) by using UV spectrophotometry.", "Densitometric scanning was performed with a Camag V scanner and measured at two different wave lengths, 272 and 318\u2009nm. The marker compounds were practically resolved with RF 0.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04 for syringic acid and 0.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 for vanillic acid. The results obtained in the study of anti-oxidant activity of MERC and MERH showed significant free radical scavenging capacity against DPPH-generated free radicals.", "The developed HPTLC method was validated for accuracy, linearity, precision, and specificity. Both the extracts revealed considerable antioxidant activity. The reported existing phenolic and flavonoids compounds are responsible for antioxidant activity of plant extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020. All rights reserved.
