Deane) and Boraginaceae plants. These compounds have various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and anti-depressive activities, but the content of these compounds in perilla has not been studied in detail. This study investigated the caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid contents of several pure strains in genus Perilla. Perilla plants cultivated under a certain set of conditions had different caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid contents. For example, their contents were higher in P. setoyensis (\"Setoegoma\"), suggesting that the genetic background of the species greatly affects caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid contents. Several strains of P. frutescens var. crispa were cultivated at the Experimental Station for Medicinal Plants, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University and differences in their caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid contents were also observed. The total content of anthocyanins, which are closely related to the leaf color of perilla, was measured as cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents, and a weak positive correlation was observed between the content of rosmarinic acid, and the total content of total anthocyanins. Furthermore, the results suggest that luminosity and photon flux density of light during cultivation can affect rosmarinic acid content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshidashimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan."}], "LastName": "Deguchi", "ForeName": "Yuya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9821-0628"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, 46-29 Yoshidashimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. michihoi@pharm.kyoto-u.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "Michiho", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101518405", "ISSNLinking": "1340-3443"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Perilla"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Deguchi Y, Ito M (2020) Rosmarinic acid in Perilla frutescens and perilla herb analyzed by HPLC.
