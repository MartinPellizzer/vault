There were observed the following results: 1) Pain decreased or disappeared in 80% of the patients. 2) Constipation decreased or disappeared in 78.6% of the patients. 3) Diarrhoea decreased or disappeared in 5 of the 6 patients that were studied. 4) There was a significative increase of the feces weight without changes of the dry residue. 5) Taking all the patients as a whole the number of the retained radio-opaque markers was the same before and after the active treatment. If we evaluate the patients with constipation and the patients with diarrhoea separately the first group shows an acceleration of the colonic transit (fewer retained markers) and the second group shows a decrease of the colonic transit (more retained markers). We draw the conclusion that the Plantago Ovatae fiber regulates or moderates the colon motility and enables a physiological balance of the colonic transit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Servicio del Gastroenterolog\u00eda, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Rep\u00fablica Argentina."}], "LastName": "Soifer", "ForeName": "L O", "Initials": "LO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Paula", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Caruso", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Efectos de la fibra medicinal sobre el tr\u00e1nsito col\u00f3nico en pacientes con s\u00edndrome del colon irritable."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Argentina", "MedlineTA": "Acta Gastroenterol Latinoam", "NlmUniqueID": "0261505", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9033"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Diseases, Functional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Transit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2849850"]}}]}
