We have recently isolated several species of LAB strains from\u00a0plant sources, such as fruits, vegetables, flowers, and medicinal plants. Since antibiotics used to treat bacterial infection diseases induce the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in intestinal microflora, it is important to evaluate the susceptibility of LAB strains to antibiotics to ensure the safety and security of processed foods. The aim of the present study is to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotics against several plant-derived LAB strains. When aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as streptomycin (SM), kanamycin (KM), and gentamicin (GM), were evaluated using LAB susceptibility test medium (LSM), the MIC was higher than when using Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium. Etest, which is an antibiotic susceptibility assay method consisting of a predefined gradient of antibiotic concentrations on a plastic strip, is used to determine the MIC of antibiotics world-wide. In the present study, we demonstrated that Etest was particularly valuable while testing LAB strains. We also show that the low susceptibility of the plant-derived LAB strains against each antibiotic tested is due to intrinsic resistance and not acquired resistance. This finding is based on the whole-genome sequence information reflecting the horizontal spread of the drug-resistance genes in the LAB strains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan."}], "LastName": "Noda", "ForeName": "Masafumi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan."}], "LastName": "Danshiitsoodol", "ForeName": "Narandalai", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mitsui Sugar Co., Ltd., Hakozaki-cho 36-2, Nihonbashi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0015, Japan."}], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Yusuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan."}], "LastName": "Okamoto", "ForeName": "Tomoko", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine, Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kasumi 1-2-3, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, 734-8551, Japan. sugi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Sugiyama", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Antibiot (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0151115", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome-Wide Association Study"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probiotics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31399643", "10.1038/s41429-019-0218-4", "10.1038/s41429-019-0218-4"]}}]}
