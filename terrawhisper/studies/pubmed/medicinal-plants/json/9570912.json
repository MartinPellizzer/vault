The distribution of seleno-amino acids in a Se-tolerant grassland legume species (Melilotus indica L.) grown in Se-laden soils was studied using high-resolution gas chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Five seleno-amino acids including selenocystine, selenomethionine, selenocysteine, Se-methylselenocysteine, and gamma-glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine were identified and measured for their plant tissue concentrations. Se-methylselenocysteine, a nonprotein seleno-amino acid, was found in the plant tissue. Its concentration ranged from 15.3 mumol kg-1 for the plants growing in soil of low Se concentration to 109.8 mumol kg-1 for the plants grown in soil of high Se concentration. Accumulation of the nonprotein seleno-amino acid in this species resembles that in Se accumulator plants. gamma-Glutamyl-Se-methylselenocysteine was detected in the plant. However, its concentration was very low. It might not become a toxic element in the food chain. Results of plant tissue Se accumulation analysis indicated that there was a five-fold increase in tissue selenocysteine concentration when the total tissue Se increased from 5.07 to 22.02 mg kg-1, but there was no further increase in tissue selenocysteine concentration when the tissue total Se concentration increased from 22.0 to 117.4 mg kg-1. Selenomethinone constituted more than 50% of the total seleno-amino acid in the plant. More research is needed to reveal whether the mechanisms limiting the accumulation of selenocysteine and preferential accumulation of selenomethionine found in this study play any role in Se tolerance in this species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of California, Davis 95616, USA."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ecotoxicol Environ Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "7805381", "ISSNLinking": "0147-6513"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organoselenium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0CH9049VIS", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenocysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1464-43-3", "NameOfSubstance": "selenocystine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48TCX9A1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "964MRK2PEL", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenomethionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TWK220499Z", "NameOfSubstance": "selenomethylselenocysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cystine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organoselenium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Selenocysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Selenomethionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Reagents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9570912", "10.1006/eesa.1997.1628", "S0147-6513(97)91628-6"]}}]}
