The Amrit Bhallatak is a compound formulation containing extract of both the cotyledons and the pericarp of the fruit of Semecarpus anacardium. RB3 is composed of the whole cotyledon (300 mg); the daily dose of cotyledons was 3.6 g. Garsin contained 200 g of cotyledons. The extract is derived by separating the oil by a physical process. The daily dosage of Amrit Bhallatak was 10 g/day, that of Garsin, 2.4 g/day. No toxicity or side effects were observed. The therapeutic value of Semecarpus anacardium in arthropathies, atopic dermatitis, leucoderma, leprosy, hypothyroidism, oligospermia, and azoospermia and its value as an oral contraceptive have been studied. The most significant effect was on the ovaries and testes. The drug probably acts via the hypophysics. Out of 266 patients, 189 were men, 77 women between 30-45 years of age. The treatment was restricted to internal medication by mouth. No external contact or application of the drug was applied. Of the 77 women treated with the drug, 41 were followed up after treatment. 12 had become pregnant and none showed any teratogenecity."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["746763", "00070560"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: Indian Journal of Experimental Biology"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Demographic Factors", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Fertility", "Fertility Measurements", "Male Contraception", "Parity", "Population", "Population Dynamics"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "4448495", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1975", "Month": "05", "Day": "21"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0019-5189", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "12", "Issue": "5", "PubDate": {"Year": "1974", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Indian journal of experimental biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Exp Biol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Clinical toxicity study of Semecarpus anacardium Linn. f.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "444", "EndPage": "446", "MedlinePgn": "444-6"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murty", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leprosy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1974", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1974", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1974", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4448495"]}}]}
