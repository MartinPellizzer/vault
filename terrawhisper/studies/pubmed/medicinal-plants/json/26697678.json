The associated genetic parameters were calculated by POPGENE 1.31. The Genetic distance was calculated by TREECONW and the systematic diagrams of genetic relationship were clustered by UPG-MA. The results showed that, using 26 primers, a total of 558 bands were produced, of which 539 were polymorphic loci. There was a high level of genetic diversity among species (PPB = 96.59%, Na = 1.9659, Na = 1.3375, H = 0.2143, I = 0.3423). However, genetic diversity was lower within species, the average of genetic parameters was PPB = 6.97%, Na = 1.0697, Na = 1.0311, H = 0.0187, I = 0.0291. The Nei's genetic differentiation coefficient was 0.9126, indicated that most of the genetic variation existed among species. By clustering analysis, different individuals gathered in the same group and the classified result of SRAP marker between traditional modal characters was almost same. The results confirmed that SRAP marker can be used as one of the effective methods to reveal the genetic diversity and relationship among medicinal species of Dipsacus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Da-xia", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Long-yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dipsacaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Amplification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26697678"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
