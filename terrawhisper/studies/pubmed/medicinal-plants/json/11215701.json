Because of the current rise in environmental pollutants and hazardous exposures of human beings, there is an imperative need for monitoring the environment for biosafety. In addition, the importance of natural products with novel activity for drug or agrochemical scopes is being more and more realized. We report on a novel test system that can act as biosensors for detecting useful compounds while simultaneously monitoring or forecasting the biohazard exposure of organisms to chemicals as well as to physical factors in a given environment. Using different compounds and factors with known biological and cytotoxic activities, a detail plant test procedure has been developed that can be used in detecting and analyzing the value and/or danger of any given compound or treatment, including cell division inhibition, cytotoxicity, growth inhibition, and anticancer activities. The method provides a highly efficient single biosensor system that can replace several individual biotesting procedures. This plant assay procedure is a highly sensitive system for monitoring physical stress factors in the environment, including ionizing and nonionizing radiation. The procedure can be followed throughout the year because of the rapid growth rate of the plant used and its regeneration in ambient conditions. Therefore, the described system is highly useful to thoroughly monitor the environment and detection of new chemicals/compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India. khanujazy@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khanuja", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darokar", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gangwar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shasany", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saikia", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hazardous Substances"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosensing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hazardous Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11215701"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
