R stricta leaves were fed to male Wistar albino rats at 2%, 10% or 50% of the diet for 6 w. Decreased growth rate, soft feces, dullness, ruffled hair and hepatonephrotoxicity were observed in rats on 10% and 50% Rhazya diet. Fifty percent Rhazya was fatal to rats, and hepatorenal lesions at 3 and 6 w confirmed changes in serum enzyme activity and in total protein, albumin, bilirubin and urea concentrations. Serum copper was decreased and zinc was increased in rats on 50% R stricta at 3 and 6 w, and were accompanied by anemia and neutropenia. Two percent Rhazya diet promoted growth as the plant leaves contained 28.3% crude protein and 16.6% crude fat and were not deficient in copper, zinc or iron."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, King Saud University, Buraidah, Al-Qassim, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematologic Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9949475"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
