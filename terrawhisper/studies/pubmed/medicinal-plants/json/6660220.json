Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride (TG) and non-esterified fatty acid levels were reduced with oral administration of ginseng principle fraction 3 (saponin content, ca. 1/5). Incorporation of 1-[14C]-acetate into total lipids and fatty acids in adipose tissue was increased by fraction 3 administration in both normal and tumor-bearing rats. The incorporation increased in the earlier stage of tumor growth and decreased in the later one. Incorporation of 1-[14C]-acetate into total lipid, free and esterified cholesterol, TG and phospholipid in the liver was also enhanced by fraction 3 administration in both normal and tumor-bearing animals. In vitro addition of ginseng principle fraction 4 (saponin content, ca. 1/2) increased incorporation of 1-[14C]-acetate into lipid fractions in adipose tissue and liver. Incorporation of 1-[14C]-acetate into lipid fractions in ascites hepatoma cells remained unchanged with both oral administration of fraction 3 and in vitro addition of fraction 4. DNA and protein synthesis in the tumor cells was not changed with in vitro addition of fraction 4."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumagai", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamamura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neoplasm Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6660220", "10.1142/S0192415X8300015X", "S0192415X8300015X"]}}]}
