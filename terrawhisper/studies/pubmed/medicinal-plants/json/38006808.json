In pursuit of profits, unscrupulous merchants have engaged in the substitution or adulteration of valuable varieties with cheaper alternatives. It is, therefore, urgent to develop effective technical approaches to identify FBs from adulterants.", "This paper employed infrared spectroscopy (IR), thin layer chromatography-image analysis (TLC-IA), and untargeted metabolomics techniques to discriminate ten species of FBs.", "Five species of FBs were successfully differentiated using mid-infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, the power of TLC-IA technology allowed the differentiation of five species of FBs and two origins of FCBs (Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus). Remarkably, through the application of untargeted metabolomics technique, the precise discrimination of five species of FBs, as well as three origins of FCBs were accomplished. Moreover, a comprehensive identification of 101 markers that reliably distinguished diverse FBs was achieved through the employment of untargeted metabolomics technique.", "The investigation presented powerful means of detection for assuring the quality control of Fritillaria herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
