Inappropriate use of current antibiotics has continuously contributed to the emergence of resistance to conventional antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the search for natural molecules that are able to combat infections is of great public interest, and many of these compounds with antimicrobial properties can be obtained from phytochemical studies of medicinal plants. In this context, this study reports the isolation and characterization of the flavonoid, kaempferol 7-O-\u03b2-D-(6\u2033-O-cumaroyl)-glucopyranoside, from Croton piauhiensis leaves. Additionally, the intrinsic antimicrobial action of the compound and its enhancement against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus strains were assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compound was determined using broth microdilution assays. To evaluate the modulatory effect of the flavonoid, the MIC of antibiotics amikacin and gentamicin, belonging to the class aminoglycosides was assessed, with and without the compound in sterile microplates. The results of intrinsic antibacterial activity tests revealed that the compound had no antibacterial activity against strains tested at concentrations <1024\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The combination of the flavonoid at a concentration of 128\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with gentamicin presented synergistic effects against S. aureus 10 and E. coli 06, and also reduced the MIC from 16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Amikacin also showed synergistic effects against S. aureus 10 and E. coli 06. We also observed reduced MIC for both, from 128\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL; however, antagonism for P. aeruginosa increased the MIC from 16\u00a0\u03bcg/mL to 64\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The combination of the flavonoid with the aminoglycosides may be an alternative to potentiate the expected results in treatment against S. aureus and E. coli, since their association leads to a synergistic effect, reducing the MIC of these drugs and decreasing the dose necessary for therapeutic success."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
