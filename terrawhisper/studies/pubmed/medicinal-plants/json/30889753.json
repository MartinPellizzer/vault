Copper nitrate (Cu (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) was used as a precursor. The stoichiometric ratio of both leaf extracts (PR/CB) and Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> was standardized for the synthesis of NSP. During formation of CuO NSP, a color of solution gradually changed from light greenish-blue to black with a number of intermediate stages and it correlated to the reduction reaction catalyzed by phytochemicals. As-synthesized materials were characterized in detail at the structural, electronic level and morphological authentication by XRD, FT-IR, EDS, UV-DRS, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM, BET and AFM. SEM studies of phytosynthesized materials revealed nearly monodisperse nanospheres, while TEM rendered average particles size 4-14\u202fnm. Also, AFM profiles suggested a homogenized nature of the nanospheres. Then, the antioxidant property was obtained by \u03b1, \u03b1-diphenyl-\u03b2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Ethanolic, methanolic extracts were used for the antioxidant activity, while ascorbic acid was used as a standard medium. Each plant extract exhibited noteworthy antioxidant activity. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of CuO NSP (PR/CB) was tested against human pathogenic bacteria viz. gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and gram-negative Escherichia coli. Result rendered effective antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
