It is a well-known antioxidant, currently being tried against several neurological disorders. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential of sesamol treatment against 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative damage in striatal, cortex and hippocampal regions of the rat. The memory performance was assessed by Morris water maze and elevated plus maze paradigms. The oxidative damage was assessed by estimating the total glutathione, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione levels and glutathione redox ratio. Glutathione-S-transferase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymes were also measured in different brain areas. 3-NP significantly impaired memory performance as assessed in Morris water maze and elevated plus maze, which was significantly attenuated by sesamol (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) pre-treatment. On the other hand, 3-NP significantly induced oxidative stress and depleted total glutathione, reduced glutathione, glutathione-S-transferase, lactate dehydrogenase enzyme levels and redox ratio in the striatum, cortex and hippocampal regions as compared to the vehicle-treated group. Sesamol pre-treatment restored oxidative defence possibly by its free radical scavenging activity as compared to the 3NP-treated group. The present study suggests that sesamol could be used as an effective agent in the management of Huntington's disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Division, University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, UGC Centre of Advanced Study, Panjab University, Chandigarh, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Puneet", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalonia", "ForeName": "Harikesh", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Anil", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101208422", "ISSNLinking": "1742-7835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzodioxoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94IEA0NV89", "NameOfSubstance": "sesamol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QY4L0FOX0D", "NameOfSubstance": "3-nitropropionic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzodioxoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escape Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitro Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Propionates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sesamum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20102363", "10.1111/j.1742-7843.2010.00537.x", "PTO537"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
