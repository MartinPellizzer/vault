Over 181 plants were collected, taxonomically identified and their detannified dichloromethane (DCM)-methanolic extracts were used for profiling selected bioactivities. Assays were performed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the extracts for Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) induction, total non-enzymatic antioxidant potential, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. The high throughput analysis of 280 extracts resulted in identification of 57.5% of the extracts that could induce ARE at one or more concentrations tested, 93.5% that harbored total antioxidant capacity, and 2.1% of the extracts that showed lung cancer cell line-specific cytotoxicity. Data from our profiling experiments indicate that a large number of extracts could be a source for further isolation and chemical identification of compounds that could serve as leads for discovery of antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents to prevent or treat complex diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Throughput Screening Laboratory, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS66047, USA."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Anuradha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "High Throughput Screening Laboratory, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS66047, USA."}], "LastName": "McDonald", "ForeName": "Peter", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry.
