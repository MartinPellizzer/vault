The meals had comparable physical appearance and contained similar amounts of digestible carbohydrate, fat, and protein. No difference in gastric emptying, recorded by gamma camera after mixing 51Cr with the meals, was found between the meals. The bean-flakes meal gave significantly lower blood glucose (p less than 0.01) and serum insulin (p less than 0.05) concentrations than did the potato-flakes meal. The overall blood glucose response, calculated as incremental area under the curves for 2 h, also differed between the meals (p less than 0.05) whereas the overall insulin response did not differ significantly. The low glycemic response after bean flakes could not be explained by the gastric emptying rate, which provides additional evidence for the slow digestion of bean starch in the small intestine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, University of G\u00f6teborg, Sahlgren's Hospital, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Torsdottir", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alpsten", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schweizer", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "T\u00f6lli", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "W\u00fcrsch", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Formulated"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Emptying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2688396", "10.1093/ajcn/50.6.1415"]}}]}
