Here, we report that a natural compound bufalin (BF) could time-dependently inactivate hCYP3A via complex CYP-catalyzed cascade oxidative metabolism. Metabolite profiling and time-dependent inhibition assays showed that 3-keto-bufalin (3-KBF), a unique nonpolar oxidative metabolite of BF, was the key substance responsible for hCYP3A inactivation. Further investigations demonstrated that 3-KBF was further metabolized by hCYPs to generate two mono-hydroxylated metabolites, which could be readily dehydrated and then covalently bound on glutathione or hCYP3A4. Collectively, this study uncovers unique CYP-catalyzed cascade oxidative pathways of BF in which two reactive intermediates bearing a Michael acceptor are finally formed as hCYP3A inactivators. These findings expand the current knowledge of CYP inactivators and suggest that some steroids bearing the 3-keto group may trigger time-dependent CYP3A inactivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Dongzhu", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Key Laboratory of Metabolic Target Characterization and Traditional Chinese Medicine Intervention, College of Integrative Medicine, National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China."}], "LastName": "Ning", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Liwei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yani", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dalian Key Laboratory of Metabolic Target Characterization and Traditional Chinese Medicine Intervention, College of Integrative Medicine, National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug Development of Neurodegenerative Disease, College of Pharmacy, Dalian Medical University, Dalian 116044, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Xiangge", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8187-2147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9670-4349"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine Research, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Guangbo", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9716531", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2623"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bufanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U549S98QLW", "NameOfSubstance": "bufalin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bufanolides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35094507", "10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c01875"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
