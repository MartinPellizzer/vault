Because of its higher price and scarce resources, its related species D. officinale and D. moniliforme are usually presented as \"Huoshan shihu\" for sale. Fengdou, the processed form of D. huoshanense, its identification is particularly important. To effectively identify Fengdou of D. huoshanense and protect the Daodi herb, the morphological and microscopic characteristics of the stems of three Dendrobium species were examined. The results showed that macroscopic and microscopic features helpful for identification of the three species were the total lengths and internode numbers of stems, diameter and length of each internode, number of vascular bundles, and presence or absence of silica masses. The key features useful for distinguishing between D. huoshanense and its related species, and also between their Fengdou, were the stem lengths and the trends of change in diameter in different internodes. The results of the study indicated that a combination of macroscopic and microscopic identification techniques might conveniently and effectively be applied for identification of Dendrobium species. \"Longtou Fengwei\" is the main feature of the Daodi herb \"Huoshan shihu,\" (D. huoshanense Fengdou) and reflects the wisdom behind the protection of Daodi herbs in ancient times."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yujiao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Synergetic Innovation Center of Dendrobia Industrialization Development in Anhui Province, Lu'an, 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Bangxing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4656-1543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Huasheng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of TCM Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan, 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University, Synergetic Innovation Center of Dendrobia Industrialization Development in Anhui Province, Lu'an, 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Improvement, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Daiyin", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28245078", "10.1002/jemt.22856"]}}]}
