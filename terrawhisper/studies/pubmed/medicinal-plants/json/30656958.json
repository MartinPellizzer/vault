This metallic pollutant was selected to its high toxicity and to its great release from several industrial and agricultural activities emissions in the area of the study region. Artemisia herba alba is a medicinal plant but also a forage species widely used in pasture. It has dominated then adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of Algerian steppe region, due principally to their morphological and physiological characteristics. To establish this work, A. herba alba species were selected in the Algerian steppe region, and their soils were treated weekly with K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> solution for about three months. Chromium concentrations were determined in the soil and in the different plants' parts to verify its absorption and translocation with and without pollution simulation. This study demonstrated that A. herba alba has a strong resistance to high concentrations of hexavalent chromium. An increase in chromium concentrations at the different parts of plant's has been noticed, without affecting its growth and vegetative development. The results of physiological and elementary analysis indicated that chromium was absorbed by A. herba alba. Cr (VI) accumulation in plant increase when they are increasing in soil. Translocation factor results indicated that Cr (VI) was mainly accumulated by A. herba alba roots. Particle size analysis showed that the soil is poor in organic substances and mostly sandy loams with 79.77% of sand and 9.76% of clay minerals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Ecole Nationale Polytechnique , El Harrach , Algeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et des Substances Naturelles , Universit\u00e9 Ziane Achour , Djelfa , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Rebhi", "ForeName": "A E M", "Initials": "AEM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Universit\u00e9 Mohand Oulhaj , Bouira , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Lounici", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et des Substances Naturelles , Universit\u00e9 Ziane Achour , Djelfa , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Lahrech", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Laboratoire sols et environnement , Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine , Vand\u0153uvre-l\u00e8s-Nancy , France."}], "LastName": "Morel", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18540-29-9", "NameOfSubstance": "chromium hexavalent ion"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30656958", "10.1080/15226514.2018.1524841"]}}]}
