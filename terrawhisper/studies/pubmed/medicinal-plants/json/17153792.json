No doubt to start with, he hunted for food mainly by killing the wild animals, but if there was anything on which he could depend upon with any confidence towards its availability, it was the plant. Not only the fact that a large number of plants provided him with food but also the fact that they provided him with curative medicine and shelter, were perhaps the reasons why he worshiped them more than the animals which also gave him food. There are a large number of plants, which are used by the people all over India for curse against witchcraft or to remove the effect of the evil eye and sickness. The use of the flora in India to relieve mankind from their sufferings was known from the ancient days. This includes all food, fuel, shelter, drugs, cosmetics etc. The standards have been maintained for several centuries since the disciples were trained in the forest close to the natural flora. In the present paper certain useful methodologies are evaluated for preparing standard Herbal formulations and focus mainly on two things namely drug (Dravya) and industry (pharmaceutical industry)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Institute of History of Medicine, Osmania Medical College Building, Putlibowli, Hyderabad."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Narayana", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Bull Indian Inst Hist Med Hyderabad", "NlmUniqueID": "7510174", "ISSNLinking": "0304-9558"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17153792"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
