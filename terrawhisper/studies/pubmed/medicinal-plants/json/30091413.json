In recent years, the study of anticancer drugs has become one of the most popular medical topics.", "In this review, in order to study the application of machine learning in predicting anticancer drugs activity, some machine learning approaches such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal components analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) were selected, and the examples of their applications in anticancer drugs design are listed.", "Machine learning contributes a lot to anticancer drugs design and helps researchers by saving time and is cost effective. However, it can only be an assisting tool for drug design.", "This paper introduces the application of machine learning approaches in anticancer drug design.
