Pancreatitis was induced in 6-week-old male SPF Sprague-Dawley rats by two intravenous (i.v.) administrations of 40 microg/kg cerulein. To investigate the effects of DA-9601 on the severity of pancreatitis and extent of apoptosis, rats were treated with intragastric DA-9601, 30 mg/kg (D30), 100 mg/kg (D100), or 300 mg/kg (D300), intraperitoneal superoxide dismutase, 10,000 U/kg (SOD), and i.v. gabexate mesilate, 40 mg/kg (Foy), three times (30 min before cerulein injection, 30 and 90 min after cerulein injection). The control group was administered vehicle alone. Ten rats were included in each treatment group and control group. Rats were sacrificed 5 h after cerulein treatment. Serum amylase, histological activity index (HAI), pancreatic lipid peroxide levels, and apoptotic index [in situ hybridization by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL)] were determined. Gel electrophoresis was performed for the presence of DNA fragmentations. The results were as follows. Serum amylase was significantly increased in all cerulein-treated groups compared to normal controls (p < 0.001). The HAI was significantly decreased in only the D300 group compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The apoptotic index of the cerulein-alone group was 3.8 +/- 2.7, but the mean apoptotic indexes of the SOD and Foy groups were 16.4 +/- 4.6 and 13.3 +/- 1.8, respectively, a significant increase (p < 0.01). The apoptotic index was more significantly increased in the DA-9601-treated groups, dose dependently (8.4 +/- 3.4 in D30, 14.8 +/- 4.3 in D100, 24.2 +/- 4.7 in D300). A smearing pattern of DNA electrophoresis was noted in the DA-9601-treated groups. In conclusion, DA-9601, an extract of Artemisia, induced apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells dose dependently and concomitantly attenuated the severity of pancreatitis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Gastroenterology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Hahm", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "B M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "B O", "Initials": "BO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pancreas", "NlmUniqueID": "8608542", "ISSNLinking": "0885-3177"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4V7M9137X9", "NameOfSubstance": "Gabexate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "888Y08971B", "NameOfSubstance": "Ceruletide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Amylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ceruletide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gabexate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9700946", "10.1097/00006676-199808000-00007"]}}]}
