However, there still lacks a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of SF in treating coronary heart disease (CHD). It is therefore the purpose of this study to comprehensively review all clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SF in CHD to assess its efficacy and safety.", "All analysis is based on 8 databases as of February 2023, which includes 35 outcomes of RCTs that investigate the effect of SF combination therapy in CHD. The present study evaluates the quality and bias of selected literature by the Jadad scale and Cochrane Collaboration's tools, and also the quality of evidence by GRADE Profiler. Furthermore, it applies sensitivity analysis to assess the high heterogeneity impact of outcomes and conducted subgroup analysis to estimate the influence factors in these studies. The study protocol was set documented, and published beforehand in PROSPERO (Registration No.CRD42022348841).", "The meta-analysis of 36 studies (with 3207 patients) shows that SF combined with conventional drugs has improved clinical effectiveness for patients with CHD [RR: 1.21 (95% CI 1.17,1.26); p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001]. Statistically significant results of meta-analyses are also seen in electrocardiography (ECG) efficacy, frequency of angina attacks, endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin (ET), whole Blood low shear rate (LS), platelet aggregation test (PAgT), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL6), triglyceride (TG). Adverse events are reported in 6 RCTs. By GRADE approaches, 2 outcomes (clinical efficacy, CRP) indicate a moderate quality of evidence, 17 outcomes indicate low quality of evidence, with the other 16 very low-quality.", "SF combination therapy has a better curative effect than conventional therapy. However, due to items with low-quality evidence demonstrated in the study, the presence of clinical heterogeneity, and imprecision in partial outcome measures, all these led to limitations in the evidence of this study. Thus, the conclusion needs to be further verified by more in-depth research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
