Many polyphenols, which are universal components in edible herbal medicines, have low bioavailability. Therefore, gut microbiota is a key determinant of polyphenol bioactivity. Polyphenols can alter the abundance of flora associated with neuroinflammation by reversing intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. Intestinal flora-mediated chemical modification of polyphenols can result in their conversion into active secondary metabolites. The current review summarizes the main edible medicines used in anti-depression and details the interactions between polyphenols and gut microbiota; in addition, it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the possible suppression of neuroinflammation associated with depression, by polyphenols in edible herbal medicine. A better understanding of polyphenols with bioactivities that are crucial in edible herbal medicine may facilitate their use in the prevention and treatment of neuroinflammation associated with depression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Formula-Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Wenzhi", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Formula-Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Formula-Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Formula-Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Junqing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Formula-Pattern of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiaxu", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neuroinflammatory Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dysbiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35838146", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2099808"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
