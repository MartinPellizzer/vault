International development trends of pharmacognosy studies on molecular level were analyzed by bibliometric methods using the SCIE database on Web of Science, the literature distribution, national distribution, agency distribution, periodicals distribution, and hot research topics were described using multivariate statistical analysis and multidimensional scaling analysis method,etc. The number of international pharmacognosy literature on molecular level is increasing year by year. USA, China and Japan have close cooperation, and focus on molecular identification and genetic diversity. Chinese scientists issued high-impact factor journals papers and high citations amount in the international forefront. The international pharmacognosy research on molecular level has developed rapidly. Chinese research has a significant influence.The molecular mechanism of the formation of Dao-di Herbs may become the next hotspot."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Library & Institute of Medical Information, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Beijing 100005, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Information on Traditional Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Library & Institute of Medical Information, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Beijing 100005, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ting", "Initials": "XT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Library & Institute of Medical Information, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Beijing 100005, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bibliometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Journal Impact Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Publications"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28868855", "10.4268/cjcmm20160308"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
