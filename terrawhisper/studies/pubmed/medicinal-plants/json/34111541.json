Traditional medicine systems in China and India have historical origins pertaining to mutual learning, reference, and development from medical theory to the drugs used. The exchange of traditional medicine between China and India began in the Qin and Han Dynasties (221 BC-220 AD), prospered in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and declined after the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD). It was also directly related to the rise and fall of Buddhism. The traditional medicines of the two countries are highly complementary because of differences in geographical climate and the modernisation process of traditional medicine.", "This review aimed to understand the spread and development of traditional Indian medicine in China to further promote exchange and cooperation between China and India in the field of traditional medicine.", "We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE via PubMed, CNKI, Science Direct, Sci-Hub, and other databases using the terms 'traditional Indian medicine' or 'Indian medicine' or 'Ayurveda' or 'Yoga' or 'Unani', and limiting the search to articles published between 1958 and 2019. We analysed the sources, publication date, type, and topic of the retrieved articles/studies.", "Based on the results of research on traditional Indian medicine carried out by Chinese scholars, 518 academic papers and 60 classic works published in China and abroad were collected. The results showed the following. First, Chinese scholars have systematically investigated traditional Indian medicine including its composition, management, and education; the scale of medicinal and pharmaceutical plants; protective measures of intellectual property rights of traditional medicine; and international promotion of Yoga. Second, studies have examined the development status of traditional Indian medicine in China including the spread of Yoga in the country and the industrial scale of, education in, existing problems in, and clinical research on Yoga. In addition, Chinese scholars conducted research on and the translation of classic works and terms of Ayurveda, and studied the theory, treatment, and medicine thereof. Third, the historical exchange and trading status of traditional medicine between India and China have been discussed, including the exchange of traditional medicine between the two countries, effect of traditional Indian medicine on Chinese Buddhism, and minority medicine and trade in medicinal materials between the two countries.", "India attaches great importance to the management of, education in, and industry of traditional medicine, and has made various efforts to protect intellectual property rights. Indian Yoga is very popular in China, and Chinese scholars have conducted some clinical research thereon. However, regulatory systems and legislation for Yoga are lacking in China. At present, traditional Chinese medicine scholars have an enhanced understanding of the term Yoga and less knowledge of the terms Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and similar concepts. We suggest that Chinese scholars further study the classic works, basic theories, treatment of clinical diseases, medicinal materials, and prescriptions compounding traditional Indian medicine. The results of this study highlight directions for Chinese scholars to pursue in further studying traditional Indian medicine comprehensively, and will help promote exchange and cooperation between China and India in the field of traditional medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
