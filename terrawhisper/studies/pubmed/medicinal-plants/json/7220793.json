(Corresponding current densities in the exposure medium associated with these field strengths ranged from 0.5--3.0 mA/cm2). Control and exposed roots were grown concomitantly in the same tank whose growth medium was continuously circulated. Temperature in the exposure medium was held at a constant 19 degrees C. All experiments were conducted \"double blind.\" Root growth rates were determined daily. No perturbations in root growth were observed with electric fields of 150 V/m; there was a slight effect at 360 V/m, and a pronounced decrease in growth rate occurred at 430 V/m. Root conductivities are comparable to that of the growth medium. Under conditions in which growth inhibition occurs, it is estimated that induced 60 Hz cell membrane potentials would be of the order of 3--8 mV."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carstensen", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robertson", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Child", "ForeName": "S Z", "Initials": "SZ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM09933", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Radiat Environ Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0415677", "ISSNLinking": "0301-634X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1975 Jan 31;187(4174):357-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1111109"]}, {"Citation": "Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1977 Dec 30;303:198-216", "ArticleIdList": ["290292"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7220793", "10.1007/BF01324272"]}}]}
