The cultures were vigorous and showed no visual signs of bacterial presence. The transfer from growth regulator-free culture medium to medium containing kinetin and the increase of temperature from 14\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C for fast propagation led to the emergence of latent bacteria in all twelve accessions studied.", "To investigate latent infections occurring during the development of a cryopreservation protocol of genetically interesting material using droplet-vitrification.", "Two protocols for droplet-vitrification were tested using plant vitrification solutions (PVS) 2 and 3. The bacteria were isolated and identified using 16S rDNA analysis. Next, non-cryopreserved in vitro plantlets were acclimatized and transferred to the glasshouse. After 6 weeks, shoot tips were harvested from the pot plants, surface-sterilized and initiated into culture. Further, newly acquired achenes of Tussilago were surface-sterilized and germinated in vitro and seedlings checked for bacteria.", "The bacteria from the long-term cultures were isolated and identified as Luteibacter. Regeneration after cryopreservation using PVS3 was successful despite the continuing presence of Luteibacter. Luteibacter could no longer be detected in the newly-initiated in vitro material in subsequent tests and it was also not detected in the seedlings.", "Luteibacter withstood the cryopreservation procedure. Re-initiation of infected material may be an efficient alternative to antibiotic treatment to manage bacteria in micropropagation systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."}], "LastName": "Hambeck", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), OT Gatersleben, Germany."}], "LastName": "Senula", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy; Core Facility Botanical Garden, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. andrea.kodym@univie.ac.at."}], "LastName": "Kodym", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cryo Letters", "NlmUniqueID": "9891832", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2044"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33966059"]}}]}
