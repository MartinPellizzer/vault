As a primary resource for complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has accumulated a large number of effective formulas for the treatment of liver fibrosis in clinical practice. However, studies on how to systematically optimize TCM formulas are still lacking.", "To provide a methodological reference for the systematic optimization of TCM formulae against liver fibrosis and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms; To provide an efficient method for searching for lead compounds from natural sources and developing from herbal medicines; To enable clinicians and patients to make more reasonable choices and promote the effective treatment toward those patients with liver fibrosis.", "TCM formulas related to treating liver fibrosis were collected from the Web of Science, PubMed, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, and the Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP). Furthermore, the TCM compatibility patterns were mined using association analysis. The core TCM combinations were found by designing an optimized formulas algorithm. Finally, the hub target proteins, potential molecular mechanisms, and active compounds were explored through integrative pharmacology and docking-based inverse virtual screening (IVS) approaches.", "We found that the herbs for reinforcing deficiency, activating blood, removing blood stasis, and clearing heat were the basis of TCM formulae patterns. Furthermore, the combination of Salviae Miltiorrhizae (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge; Chinese salvia/Danshen), Astragali Radix (Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge; Astragalus/Huangqi), and Radix Bupleuri (Bupleurum chinense DC.; Bupleurum/Chaihu) was identified as core groups. A total of six targets (TNF, STAT3, EGFR, IL2, ICAM1, PTGS2) play a pivotal role in TCM-mediated liver fibrosis inhibition. (-)-Cryptotanshinone, Tanshinaldehyde, Ononin, Thymol, Daidzein, and Formononetin were identified as active compounds in TCM. And mechanistically, TCM could affect the development of liver fibrosis by regulating inflammation, immunity, angiogenesis, antioxidants, and involvement in TNF, MicroRNAs, Jak-STAT, NF-kappa B, and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed that key components had good potential to bind to the target genes.", "In summary, this study provides a methodological reference for the systematic optimization of TCM formulae and exploration of underlying molecular mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
