Four of the diets consisted of more than 50% of the traditional sole feeds wheat (W), rye (R), maize (M), or lupin seed (L), mixed with other ingredients to give diets with similar concentration of energy and crude protein. The fifth diet consisted exclusively of deep frozen zooplankton (Z). The fish were given a daily feed amount of 1.8% of bodyweight. The bodyweights of the carp on the cereal diets or the lupin seed diet were similar at the end of the experiment, after 105 days, (W) 995 g, (R) 916 g, (M) 979 g, (L) 979 g, but were significantly lower on diet (Z) at 659 g. Average OM digestibility coefficients for the diets were 77-79% for the cereal-rich diets, 68% for (L), and 75% for (Z). The contents of skinless fillet (average 38.7%), viscera (average 13.2%) and residual carcass (average 48.2%) were similar for the diets with cereals or lupin seed, while fish on diet (Z) had significantly lower fillet proportion (33.6%), coupled with an increase in residual carcass (53.0%). The chemical composition of the fillet, viscera and the residual carcass was also affected. Fish on diet (M) had the highest fat content in the whole body (14.5% of the FM), followed by those on diets (W) and (R) at 13.3% and 12.9%, while fish on diets (L) and (Z) had significantly lower fat contents at 10.7% and 8.2%. Protein contents in the whole body (% of FM) were for diets (L) 16.7%, (W) 16.4% (R) 16.3%, (M) 16.2%, and (Z) 15.5%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrungsphysiologie, Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Freising-Weihenstephan, Deutschland."}], "LastName": "Oberle", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schwarz", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kirchgessner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Wachstum und Schlachtk\u00f6rperqualit\u00e4t von Karpfen (Cyprinus carpio L.) bei Verf\u00fctterung von verschiedenen Getreidearten, Lupinen oder Zooplankton."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Arch Tierernahr", "NlmUniqueID": "0217641", "ISSNLinking": "0003-942X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Composition"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carps"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zooplankton"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9304388", "10.1080/17450399709386120"]}}]}
