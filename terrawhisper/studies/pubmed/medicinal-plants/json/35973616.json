Their structures were established by comprehensive 1D, 2D-NMR and HRESIMS analyses, and their absolute configurations were determined by comparing their calculated ECD data with the experimental ones. Evaluations of the anti-inflammatory activity revealed that kunawuronoside A-D and compounds 14-15 inhibited COX-2 expression with inhibition rates ranging from 36.7% to 58.5%, while the NO production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was suppressed by the kunawuronoside A-D in a dose-dependent manner in RAW264.7 macrophage cell line."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
