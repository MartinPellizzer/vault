We have assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in adolescents. In this study, 897 adolescent girls living in Mashhad and Sabzevar, Iran, received nine high-dose vitamin D supplements (as 50,000\u2009IU/week of cholecalciferol) and were followed up over 9\u00a0weeks. We evaluated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on individuals in four categories: those with only PMS; individuals with only dysmenorrhea; subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea and normal subjects. The prevalence of PMS after the intervention fell from 14.9% to 4.8% (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Similar results were also found for the prevalence of subjects with dysmenorrhea (35.9% reduced to 32.4%), and in subjects with both PMS and dysmenorrhea (32.7% reduced 25.7%). Vitamin D supplementation was associated with a reduction in the incidence of several symptoms of PMS such as backache and tendency to cry easily as well as decrement in pain severity of dysmenorrhea (p\u2009<\u2009.05). High dose vitamin D supplementation can reduce the prevalence of PMS and dysmenorrhea as well as has positive effects on the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Student Research Committee , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrami", "ForeName": "Afsane", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, School of Health , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Habibollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Clinical Research Unit , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Tayefi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine , Arak University of Medical Sciences , Arak , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Faezeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "h Department of Nutrition, School of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Nejati Salehkhani", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "h Department of Nutrition, School of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Arabpour-Dahoue", "ForeName": "Mahla", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Rastgar-Moghadam", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "i Division of Medical Education , Brighton & Sussex Medical School , Brighton , UK."}], "LastName": "Ferns", "ForeName": "Gordon A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "j Complementary and Chinese Medicine, Persian and Complementary Medicine Faculty , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrami-Taghanaki", "ForeName": "Hamidreza", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghayour-Mobarhan", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Gynecol Endocrinol", "NlmUniqueID": "8807913", "ISSNLinking": "0951-3590"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Menstruation Disturbances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29447494", "10.1080/09513590.2017.1423466"]}}]}
