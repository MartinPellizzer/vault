Several nutraceuticals have been widely studied as supplements due to their functional properties ameliorating symptoms associated with neurological disorders, such as oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory states. This seems to be the case of some fruits and seeds from the Amazon Biome consumed since the pre-Columbian period that could have potential beneficial impact on the human nervous system. The beneficial activities of these food sources are possibly related to a large number of bioactive molecules including polyphenols, carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and trace elements. In this context, this review compiled the research on six Amazonian fruits and seeds species and some of the major nutraceuticals found in their composition, presenting brief mechanisms related to their protagonist action in improving inflammatory responses and neuroinflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
