The lyophilized extract was administered to male Swiss mice. Formalin paw test and tail flick tests were used for the evaluation of the antinociceptive activity. Plant extract (10, 25, 50 and 60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) (n = 16-24 for each group) or vehicle (n = 27) was administered 30 min before the subplantar formalin injection. In the tail flick test, mice were examined for latency to withdraw their tails from a noxious thermal stimulus using a tail flick meter (n = 8 for each group). The effects of the extract on sensorimotor performance was also assessed (n = 16-24 for each group). The extract caused a significant dose-related inhibition of the first phase (50, 60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) and second phase (10, 25, 50 and 60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) of formalin induced hindpaw licking. Additionally, the extract administration (50, 60 mg kg(-1), i.p.) increased the tail flick latencies. No significant change was observed in any of the treatment groups in the sensorimotor performance test. The observed antinociceptive activity of the extract may be due to its noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake blocking activity. Moreover, the probable antiinflammatory activity of the extract may play a role in the dose-related inhibition of the second phase of formalin paw test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ege University, Center for Drug R&D and Pharmacokinetic [E1]Applications, Izmir, Turkey. apaydin@egeuniv.ege.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apaydin", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeybek", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ince", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elgin", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karamenderes", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozturk", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tuglular", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10617065", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00071-9", "S0378874199000719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
