Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques used for solving the optimization problems. Using the RSM method, compounds, extracts, antioxidant and antibacterial agents of methanol, hexane, chloroform and water extracts of black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) found in Iran, had been studied for this research. GC and GC/MS had been used to determine the composition of the extracts from the aerial parts of S. nigrum. The major components of these varieties are alkane and alkane acid derivatives. The research has shown significant results that the maximum antioxidant activity was achieved in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test, and significant differences were also observed between the extracts and solvents in this respect (P<0.05, R<sup>2</sup><sub>adj</sub>=99.97%). As regards the antibacterial activity, the chloroform extract has the largest zone of growth inhibition diameter in which the gram-positive bacteria were cultured."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, North Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Akbar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, North Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tahazadeh", "ForeName": "Abdul Rahman", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Medical Sciences University of Mazandaran, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Ali", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum nigrum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28649072"]}}]}
