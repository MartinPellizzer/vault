Methods POR recombinant lentivirus was established and infected with Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO cells, and the expression of green fluorescent protein was observed by fluorescence microscope for monoclonal screening. Mitomycin C (MMC) cytotoxic assay, Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were employed to detect the activity and expression of POR, and eventually obtained a cell line stably expressing POR (Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR). Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR cells (Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR-2C19) stably co-expressing POR and CYP2C19, and Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO cells stably expressing CYP2C19 (Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-2C19) were constructed, and the activity of CYP2C19 was measured by cyclophosphamide (CPA). Results The consequences of MMC cytotoxic assay, Western blot and qRT-PCR illuminated that Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO cells infected with POR recombinant lentivirus had elevated MMC metabolic activity and boosted the expression of POR mRNA and protein, compared with Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO cells infected with negative control virus, indicating that Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR cells stably expressing POR were obtained. No significant disparity existed in the metabolic activity of CPA between Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-2C19 and Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO cells, whereas the metabolic activity enhanced in Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR-2C19 and was significantly higher than in Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-2C19 cells. Conclusion The stable expression of Flp-In<sup>TM</sup> CHO-POR cell line is successfully established and can be further applied to construct CYP transgenic cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004; Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Dingyan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004; Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004; Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Junqi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yonglin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004; Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China. *Corresponding author, E-mail: 970088464@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Xiaolan", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "101139110", "ISSNLinking": "1007-8738"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lentivirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36872427"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
