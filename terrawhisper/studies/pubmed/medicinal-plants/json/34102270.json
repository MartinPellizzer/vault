(Liliaceae) consisted of 33 species, of which the study focused on Paris polyphylla Smith, P. polyphylla var. chinensis (Franch.) Hara, and P. polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand. -Mazz. Due of course to the good effects of analgesia and hemostasis, it was traditionally used to treat trauma by folk herbalists.", "This study summarized the traditional uses, distributions, phytochemical components, pharmacological properties, and toxicity evaluation of the genus Paris, and reviewed the economic value of cultivate P. polyphylla. This aim was that of providing a new and comprehensive recognition of these medicinal plants for the further utilization of Paris plants.", "The literature about traditional and folk uses of genus Paris was obtained from Duxiu Search, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The other literature about genus Paris was searched online on Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, Scifinder database, and Springer research. The Scientific Database of China Plant Species (DCP) (http://db.kib.ac.cn/Default.aspx) databases were used to check the scientific names and provide species, varieties, and distribution of genus Paris. The botany studies information of genus Paris was available online from Plant Plus of China (www.iplant.cn). All the molecular structures of chemical compounds displayed in the text were produced by ChemBioDraw Ultra 14.0.", "The plants of genus Paris, containing about 33 species and 15 varieties, are mainly distributed in Southwest China (Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces). More than 320 chemical components have been isolated from genus Paris since 2020, including steroidal saponins, C-21 steroids, phytosterols, insect hormones, pentacyclic triterpenes, flavonoids, and other compounds. Arrays of pharmacological investigations revealed that compounds and extracts of Paris species possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, such as antitumor, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antifungal, hemostatic, and anti-inflammatory activities. The studies about toxicity evaluation suggested that Rhizome Paridis had slight liver toxicity.", "The dried rhizomes of P. polyphylla, P. polyphylla var. chinensis, and P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis were used to treat wound, bleeding, and stomachache, etc. in folk medicine. Phytochemistry researches showed that different species had pretty similarities especially in terms of chemical constituents. Pharmacological studies witnessed that Rhizome Paridis has various activities. Among these activities, steroidal saponins were the main active ingredients. Furthermore, an important aspect responsible for increasing interest in genus Paris is the use of antifertility-nonhormonal contraceptives by women. Also, the development of TCM (Traditional Chinese medicine) planting industry can improve the income of ethnic minorities and promote economic development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
