The proximate composition of the bambara groundnut seed was found to be 9.7% moisture, 16.6% protein, 5.9% fat, 2.9% ash, 4.9% crude fibre and 64.9% carbohydrate. Maximum water absorption was attained after soaking for 11, 9, 6, and 4 h at 25, 40, 50, and 60 degrees C, respectively. Maximum dehulling efficiency was attained when the seeds absorbed 54.7% water and drying for 9 h at 60 degrees C. Study of the microstructure of the raw flour and seed showed that they contained differently shaped and sized starch granules and protein materials within the cell wall in the cotyledon. Milling disorganised the arrangement of these components in the cotyledons. In the steamed moin-moin ('okpa'), all components in the seed had lost their identity and integrity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Nigeria, Enugu State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Enwere", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hung", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8933200", "10.3109/09637489609031875"]}}]}
