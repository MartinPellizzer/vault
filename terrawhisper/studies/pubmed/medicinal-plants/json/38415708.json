The oncogenic modifications of KRAS are intricately linked to tumor development and are identified in 22% of cancer patients. This has spurred the necessity to explore inhibition mechanisms, with the aim of investigating and repurposing existing drugs for diagnosing cancers dependent on KRAS G12C In this investigation, 26 nucleoside-based drugs were collected from literature to assess their effectiveness against KRAS G12C. The study incorporates <i>in-silico</i> molecular simulations and molecular docking examinations of these nucleoside-derived drugs with the KRAS G12C protein using Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 5V71. The docking outcomes indicated that two drugs, Azacitidine and Ribavirin, exhibited substantial binding affinities of -8.7 and -8.3\u2009kcal/mol, respectively. These drugs demonstrated stability in binding to the active site of the protein during simulation studies. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) analyses indicated that the complexes closely adhered to an equilibrium RMSD value ranging from 0.17 to 0.2\u2009nm. Additionally, % occupancies, bond angles and the length of hydrogen bonds were calculated. These findings suggest that Azacitidine and Ribavirin may potentially serve as candidates for repurposing in individuals with KRAS-dependent cancers.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
