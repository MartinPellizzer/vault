They supply proteins of low biological value, minimal amounts of lipids (mostly essential polyunsaturated), complex carbohydrates, and soluble fiber, which are fermented into short-chain fatty acids by the colonic flora, and insoluble fiber that modulates intestinal function. Minerals, trace elements, and vitamins add to the value of fiber-containing foods in the diet. Recent nutritional surveys indicate that the diets of 12-month-old infants tend to include too much animal proteins and to be too protein-dense, which could be corrected with an increase of fiber-containing foods.", "Fiber-containing foods share unique characteristics with nutritional and metabolic implications for the weaning infant. Whole cereals, green vegetables, and legumes should be routinely introduced during the weaning process to achieve a better nutritional balance and to accustom children to diets with fiber content. The daily intake of fiber should be gradually increased to 5 g/d during the second semester of life."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Milan, San Paolo Biomedical Institute, Italy."}], "LastName": "Agostoni", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Riva", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Giovannini", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pediatrics", "NlmUniqueID": "0376422", "ISSNLinking": "0031-4005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrition Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}], "NumberOfReferences": "42"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7494670"]}}]}
