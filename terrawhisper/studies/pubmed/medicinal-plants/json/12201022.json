The formulations used were: 1) Formulation A comprising Cymbogogon citratus leaves, Carica papaya leaves, and Zea mays silk. 2) Formulation B comprising C. papaya roots, Mangifera indica leaves, Citrus limon fruit and C. citratus leaves. 3) C. papaya leaves. 4) Emilia coccinea whole plant. 5) Comelina bengalensis leaves. 6) Telfaria occidentalis leaves. 7) Gossypium arboreum whole plant. Antimicrobial activity was tested using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays. Generally, Formulation A elicited inhibitory activity at a lower range of 0.02 to 0.06 mg/ml. Similarly, Formulation B elicited bacterial activity at the lowest range of 0.06 to 0.25 mg/ml. C. bengalensis leaves on the other hand, showed the lowest activity with a concentration range of 0.132 to 2.0 mg/ml and 1 to 4 mg/ml in MIC and MBC assays respectively. S. paratyphi was most sensitive to the formulations (concentration range of 0.02 to 1 mg/ml in both MIC and MBC assays) while S. typhimurium was the least sensitive and concentrations of up to 4 mg/ml were required to be bactericidal.", "It is concluded that plant extracts with low MIC and MBC values (1 mg/ml and lower) may contain compounds with therapeutic activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Life Sciences and Chemistry, University of Buea, PO Box 63, Buea, South West Province, Cameroon."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nkuo-Akenji", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ndip", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McThomas", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fru", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Zimbabwe", "MedlineTA": "Cent Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372566", "ISSNLinking": "0008-9176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Typhoid Fever"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12201022", "10.4314/cajm.v47i6.8607"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
