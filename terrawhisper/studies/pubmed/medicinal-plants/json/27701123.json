Plants with a wide range of secondary metabolites, with valuable properties like antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, can be a promising source of wound healing agents.", "Effects of hydromethanolic extracts of Lythrum salicaria and Hypericum scabrum, individually and in combination, were assessed in second-degree burn wounds in rats in comparison to a white oleaginous base (negative control) and silver sulfadiazine (positive control). Histological assessments as well as total thiol molecules, lipid peroxidation, and total antioxidant power were evaluated in skin tissue samples. Total phenol, flavonoids, and tannins along with the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the extracts were also as- sessed.", "Total phenol, total flavonoid, and total tannin amounts for L. salicaria and H. scabrum were 331 \u00b1 3.7 and 308.1 \u00b1 5.2 \u03bcg gallic acid/mg extract, 5.8 \u00b1 0.4 and 4.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcg quercetin/mg extract, and 430 \u00b1 2.33 and 13.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u03bcg tannic acid/mg extract, respectively. H. scabrum significantly inhibited S. aureus and L. salicaria moderately suppressed Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans growth. Wound contraction percentage with L. salicaria and H. scabrum was 89.5 \u00b1 3.7 and 77.6 \u00b1 4.1, respectively. A well-organized epidermal layer and normal appearance in dermis layer were more observable in the L. salicaria group. Moreover, L. salicaria ointment individually displayed better influence on tissue oxidative stress parameters than H. scabrum and the negative control (P < 0.05).", "Results of this study clearly confirm the effectiveness of L. salicaria topical ointment as a wound healing agent, possibly due to the considerable polyphenolic content and antioxidant properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vafi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahramsoltani", "ForeName": "Roodabeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Manayi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Pharmacology and Applied Medicine, Department of Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hossein Abdolghaffari", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug and Food Control, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Samadi", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amin", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Hassanzadeh", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug and Food Control, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Jamalifar", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Baeeri", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran and Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}], "LastName": "Khanavi", "ForeName": "Mahnaz", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Wounds", "NlmUniqueID": "9010276", "ISSNLinking": "1044-7946"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["27701123", "WNDS20160929-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
