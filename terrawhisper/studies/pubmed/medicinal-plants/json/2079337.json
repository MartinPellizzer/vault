Keeping a constant and high Mg2+ concentration and varying the concentration of one of the substrates (ATP or 3-phosphoglycerates) at several fixed concentrations of the other substrate (3-phosphoglycerate or ATP), the Km values of Mg.ATP2- and 3-phosphoglycerate were found to be 0.42 and 0.60 mM, respectively. These values are independent of the concentration of the other substrate. A limiting value of Vmax, where the enzyme is saturated with both the substrates, was found to be 39.4 mumoles product formed per min per mg enzyme protein. This corresponds to a turnover number equal to 31.5 sec-1 (for molecular weight of the enzyme equal to 48,000). If [Mg2+] and [ATP4-] are held equal and varied together at several fixed concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate, deviations from Michaelis-Menten kinetics (non-linear Lineweaver-Burk plots) are observed at lower values of ATP4- and Mg2+ (less than 0.1 mM), giving rise to apparent sigmoidicity in the rate versus [ATP4-] plots. It has been suggested that the real substrate for this enzyme is the Mg.ATP2- complex (and not free ATP4-). The complex dissociates at lower values of [Mg2+] and [ATP4-]. The resulting disproportionate decrease in the concentration of the complex brings about a steeper fall in the rate of reaction than is required by the Michaelis-Menten equation, giving rise to an apparent sigmoidicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malhotra", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "820-11-1", "NameOfSubstance": "3-phosphoglycerate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.2.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoglycerate Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glyceric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoglycerate Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2079337"]}}]}
