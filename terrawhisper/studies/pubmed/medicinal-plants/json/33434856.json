In this study, several Hibiscus species (leaves) were extracted with petroleum ether, methanol, and their mucilage was separated. All the tested species extracts were assessed for their viability percentage using the water-soluble tetrazolium. H.syriacus was the plant of choice to be incorporated in a new drug delivery system and evaluated for its wound healing activity. H.syriacus petroleum ether extract (PEE) showed a high percentage of palmitic and oleic acids while its mucilage demonstrated high glucosamine and galacturonic acid. It was selected to be formulated and pharmaceutically evaluated into three different composite sponges using chitosan in various ratios. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy investigated the chemical interaction between the utilized sponges' ingredients. Morphological characteristics were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. H.syriacus composite sponge of mucilage: chitosan (1:5) was loaded with three different concentrations of PEE. Medicated formulations were assessed in rat model of excision wound model. The wound healing ability was clearly proved by the clinical acceleration, histopathological examination, and modulation of correlated inflammatory parameters as tumor necrosis factor in addition to vascular endothelial growth factor suggesting a promising valuable candidate that supports the management of excision wounds using single-dose preparation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
