Wistar albino rats were fed with fresh garlic homogenate daily by gavage in three different doses (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day) for 30 days. After this period, rats were sacrificed and liver and kidneys were harvested for biochemical estimation. In comparison to saline-treated rats, the 250 mg/kg/day dose significantly (P<0.02) reduced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (L: 187.48+/-9.23 vs 150.66+/-11.45; K: 177.38 15.88 vs 120.66+/-9.39 nmol/g wet. weight) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (L: 0.2438+/-0.05 vs 0.0046+/-0.0005; K: 0.1459+/-0.034 vs 0.0055+/-0.0003 U/mg protein). There was no change in catalase and reduced glutathione (GSH) but superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased significantly (P<0.01) (L: 5.49+/-0.76 vs 18.38+/-2.26; K: 11.47+/-1.48 vs 21.22+/-3.19 U/mg protein). Both 500 and 1000 mg/kg/day doses significantly (P<0.05) reduced endogenous antioxidants (catalase and SOD) without altering TBARS. A 1000 mg/kg/day dose of garlic caused marked histopathological and ultrastructural changes in both liver and kidneys. The results suggest that garlic in low doses has the potential to enhance the endogenous antioxidant status, although at higher doses a reversal of these effects is observed. The present study also highlights the potential ability of a high dose of garlic to induce morphological changes in the liver and kidneys, indicating the need to identify a safe dose range for garlic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, 110029, New Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maulik", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manchanda", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dinda", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maulik", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11434986", "10.1016/s0278-6915(01)00018-7", "S0278-6915(01)00018-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
