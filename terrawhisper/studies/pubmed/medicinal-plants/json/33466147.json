At present, acupoint herbal patching as an adjuvant therapy is currently undergoing clinical trials in different medical centers.

There is also a lack of systematic evaluation and analysis of acupoints and herbs.", "We will search the following 8 databases from their inception to November 15, 2020, without language restrictions: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the Chinese Scientific Journal Database, the Wan-Fang Database and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The primary outcome measures will be clinical effective rate, functional outcomes, and quality of life. Data that meets the inclusion criteria will be extracted and analyzed using RevMan V.5.3 software. Two reviewers will evaluate the studies using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.
