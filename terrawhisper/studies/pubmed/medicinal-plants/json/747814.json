Antisera of three peanut Rhizobium strains were tested against eight different Rhizobium isolates. Three serogroups identified by agglutination and immunodiffusion tests were confirmed by ELISA. In this experiment ELISA was more sensitive by four to six orders of magnitude than the agglutination and immunodiffusion tests and enabled the detection of Rhizobium antigens in cell suspensions of 10(4)-10(5) cells per millilitre. The reactions of culture and nodule antigens were identical for all strains investigated. ELISA enabled the precise typing of rhizobial isolates in single small root nodules. The minimum fresh weight of nodule tissue necessary to perform the ELISA test was 0.4 mg crushed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). ELISA was also successfully used for strain identification in mixed inoculated plants. One of the strains in each pair formed most of the nodules examined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kishinevsky", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bar-Joseph", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Bacterial"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "growth & development", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serotyping"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["747814", "10.1139/m78-245"]}}]}
