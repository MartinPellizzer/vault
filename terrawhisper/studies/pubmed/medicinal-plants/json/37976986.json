In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with the mass defect filter method was used for the qualitative analysis of Farfarae Flos metabolites in the lung tissues. Then a method for the simultaneous determination of 14 Farfarae Flos metabolites was developed and validated in terms of specificity, linearity, precision and accuracy, matrix effect and recovery. The method was applied to compare the lung tissue of Farfarae Flos treated mice, and 10 caffeoylquinic acid metabolites were higher in the mice with better antitussive effect. Further network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking results showed that these metabolites played an important role in the antitussive effect of Farfarae Flos. This study presented a novel strategy for deciphering the active compounds of herbal medicine by inter-individual variability of bioactivities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
