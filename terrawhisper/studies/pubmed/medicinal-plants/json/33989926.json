Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>, 620\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mol<sup>-1</sup>)was employed to enhance the nutritive and health promoting values of sprouts of two species of lemongrass, i.e. Cymbopogon citratus and Cymbopogon proximus. eCO<sub>2</sub> improved the biomass production of sprouts, and their levels of primary metabolites e.g., amino acids and oils and active secondary metabolites e.g., phenolic compounds. As a result, eCO<sub>2</sub> increased total antioxidant capacity, cytotoxicity against several human cancer cell lines, and antibacterial activities of Cymbopogon sprouts. We also recorded a significant increase in hypocholesterolaemic potential and anti-inflammatory activities of eCO<sub>2</sub>-treated sprouts, as indicated by inhibition of cholesterol micellar solubility and pancreatic lipase activity, as well as lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase activities, respectively. Thus, the present investigation supports the use of eCO<sub>2</sub> as a promising approach to produce lemongrass sprouts with effective phytochemicals and enhanced biological activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
