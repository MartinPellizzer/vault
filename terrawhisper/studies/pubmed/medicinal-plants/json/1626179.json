Only the breeders were used in the experiments. A number of mice were given intracellular fluid of way-bread in subcutaneous injections. The controls received no treatment. The age at which mammary cancer appeared was noted and also how often the tumors occurred. The frequency of tumor formation was 93.3% in the controls and 18.2% in the treated mice.
