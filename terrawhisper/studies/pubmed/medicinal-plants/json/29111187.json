Traditionally used medicinal plants are an essential part of the health sector in Bangladesh due to its abundance of a vast source of ethno-medicine.

This study has focused on five plants which are Andrographis paniculata, Ageratum conyzoides, Swertia chirata, Terminalia arjuna, and Azadirachta indica to find out their traditional formulation as anti-diabetic medicine and their pharmacological activity has also been explored through literature search. The available information about traditional anti-diabetic uses of these plants and their pharmacological activities were collected from various electronic sources like Pubmed, SciFinder, Elsevier, Springer, Scopus, Scirus, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Web of Science apart from these locally available books and peer reviewed journal were also used to collect information.
