The antimutagens were isolated from the bioactive hexane and carbon tetrachloride fractions following a bioactivity-directed fractionation scheme and using the micronucleus test to monitor the antimutagenic activities. Structure elucidation studies indicated that C1 is stigmast-7-enol[1], D3 is lupeol carboxylic acid [2] and F2 is ursolic acid [3]. The structure of A1 was not fully elucidated but MS data suggested that it contained a long hydrocarbon chain. At a dosage of 2 mg isolate/25 g mouse, A1 reduced the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MPCE) induced by the mutagen, mitomycin C, by 75%, C1 by 80%, D3 by 57%, and F2 by 76%. Compound A2 was also isolated but was found inactive. Its structure was identified to be lupeol acetate [4]."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, College of Science, University of the Phillippines (UP), Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Guevara", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amor", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8980690", "10.1016/s0165-1161(96)90240-x", "S0165-1161(96)90240-X"]}}]}
