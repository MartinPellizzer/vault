For both systems, LOX was irreversibly inactivated by high-pressure treatment combined with subzero and elevated temperatures and the inactivation could be described as a first-order reaction. At ambient pressure, in situ LOX was less thermostable than in the juice at temperatures below 68 degrees C whereas the stability ranking was reverse at temperatures above 68 degrees C. At temperatures below 63 degrees C, sensitivity of the inactivation rate constants to temperature changes was on the same order of magnitude in the juice and in situ, while at higher temperature it was lower in situ. The pressure needed to obtain the same rate of LOX inactivation at a given temperature was lower in situ than in the juice. Application of high-pressure treatment at low/subzero temperature resulted in an antagonistic effect on LOX inactivation for both systems, whereas no such effect was found above room temperature. The pressure-temperature dependence of the LOX inactivation rate constants in green beans was successfully modeled."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Microbial Technology, Faculty of Agricultural and Applied Biological Sciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kardinaal Mercierlaan 92, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Indrawati", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ludikhuyze", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Van Loey", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hendrickx", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10820104", "10.1021/jf990937n", "jf990937n"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
