Succinate:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity of these mitochondria was inhibited to a similar extent. The oxidation of ascorbate/TMPD was also sensitive to the phenothiazine (IC50 = 65 microM). Oxidation of exogenous NADH was inhibited by trifluoperazine even in the presence of excess EGTA [ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid] (IC50 = 60 microM), indicating an interaction with the electron transport chain rather than with the dehydrogenase itself. In contrast, substrate oxidation in Voodoo lily (Sauromatum guttatum) mitochondria was relatively insensitive to the phenothiazine. The results suggest the bc1 complex to be a major site of inhibition. The membrane potential of energized mung bean mitochondria was depressed by micromolar concentrations of trifluoperazine, suggesting an effect on the proton-pumping capability of these mitochondria. Membrane-bound and soluble ATPases were equally sensitive to trifluoperazine (IC50 of 28 microM for both), implying the site of inhibition to be on the F1. Inhibition of the soluble ATPase was not affected by EGTA, CaCl2, or exogenous calmodulin. Trifluoperazine inhibition of electron transport and phosphorylation in plant mitochondria appears to be due to an interaction with a protein of the organelle that is not calmodulin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dunn", "ForeName": "P P", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Slabas", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cottingham", "ForeName": "I R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moore", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "214IZI85K3", "NameOfSubstance": "Trifluoperazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.99.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinone Reductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Electron Transport Complex III"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport Complex III"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Quinone Reductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trifluoperazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6322689", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90154-1", "0003-9861(84)90154-1"]}}]}
