Metal elemental contents, chemical constituents, biomass and the structure of the rhizosphere microbial community was used to estimate this effect. The results indicated CuO NPs increased the Cu content and ZnO NPs increased the Zn content significantly as exposure increased, \u03b3-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs had no significant effect on Fe content in S. miltiorrhiza roots, while 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> ZnO and CuO NPs significantly decreased the Fe content in roots. Additionally, ZnO and \u03b3-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs increased the underground biomass, and diameter of S. miltiorrhiza roots. However, these three metal oxide nanoparticles had no significant effect on total tanshinones, while the 700\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> \u03b3-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> NPs treatment increased salvianolic acid B content by 36.46%. High-throughput sequencing indicated at 700\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> ZnO NPs, the relative abundance of Humicola (Zn superoxide dismutase producer), was notably increased by 97.46%, and that of Arenimonas, Thiobacillus and Methylobacillus (taxa related to heavy metal tolerance) was significantly increased by 297.14%, 220.26% and 107.00%. The 700\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> CuO NPs exposure caused a significant increase in the relative abundances of Sphingomonas (a copper-resistant and N<sub>2</sub>-fixing genus) and Flavisolibacter (stripe rust biocontrol bacteria) by 127.32% and 118.33%. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to examine the potential impact of NPs on the growth and rhizosphere microorganisms of S. miltiorrhiza."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
