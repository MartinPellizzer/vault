This review focuses on Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid found in various medicinal plants, which has garnered attention in the field of oncology for its anticancer potential either alone or in combination with other compounds and its ability to modulate chemoresistance, acting as a natural chemosensitizer. BBR's ability to modulate chemoresistance is attributed to its diverse mechanisms of action, including inducing DNA breaks, inhibition of drug efflux pumps, modulation of apoptosis and necroptosis, downregulating multidrug resistance genes, enhancing immune response, suppressing angiogenesis and targeting multiple pathways within cancer cells, including protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (Akt/mTOR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1), janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), Wnt/\u03b2-catenin etc. Moreover, BBR, in combination with other compounds, also offers a promising approach to cancer therapy, enforcing its broad-spectrum anticancer effects. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the intricate mechanism of action of BBR in combinatorial therapy as a potential chemosensitizer to increase the efficiency of several drugs, including cisplatin, doxorubicin, lapatinib, tamoxifen, irinotecan, niraparib, etc. in various cancers. Additionally, this review briefly covers the origin and biological activities of BBR, exploring the specific actions underlying its anticancer effects. Further, pharmacokinetic properties of BBR are also discussed, providing insight into its therapeutic potential and optimization of its use in cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
