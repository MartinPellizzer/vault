The oral bioavailability of linagliptin is low (29.5%) due to its first pass metabolism in the intestine and liver. Gallic acid and ellagic acid are natural polyphenols which are widely distributed in fruits and medicinal plants. Gallic acid and ellagic acid have been reported to inhibit p-glycoprotein (p-gp) and enhance the bioavailability of p-gp substrate drugs. Hence, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of gallic acid and ellagic acid on intestinal transport and bioavailability of linagliptin, a p-gp substrate in diabetic rats. Methods The intestinal transport of linagliptin was assessed by conducting an in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion study. The oral pharmacokinetics was evaluated by conducting oral bioavailability study in diabetic rats. Results After pretreatment with gallic acid and ellagic acid, no significant change in effective permeability of linagliptin was observed at the ileum part of the rat intestine. A significant improvement in the peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration time profile (AUC), AUMC, AUCtotal and decrease in clearance were observed in rats pretreated with gallic acid and ellagic acid. Conclusions This study demonstrates that gallic acid and ellagic acids increase the bioavailability of oral linagliptin in rats due to the inhibition of p-gp. These animal data need to be confirmed in a clinical setting to determine whether linagliptin dosing should be adjusted when given concomitantly with these phytochemicals or gallic acid/ellagic acid-containing dietary supplements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and phytochemistry, Kakatiya University, Warangal, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Shaik", "ForeName": "Munthaj", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and phytochemistry, Kakatiya University, Warangal, Telangana, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kakatiya University, Warangal, Telangana-506009, India."}], "LastName": "Vanapatla", "ForeName": "Swaroopa Rani", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Pers Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101653409", "ISSNLinking": "2363-8915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3X29ZEJ4R2", "NameOfSubstance": "Linagliptin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Linagliptin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31256062", "10.1515/dmpt-2018-0020", "/j/dmdi.2019.34.issue-2/dmpt-2018-0020/dmpt-2018-0020.xml"]}}]}
