Dunal, commonly known as Ashwagandha, belongs to the family Solanaceae. In Ayurveda, Ashwagandha has been defined as one of the most important herb and is considered to be the best adaptogen. It is also an excellent rejuvenator, a general health tonic and cure for various disorders such as cerebrovascular, insomnia, asthma, ulcers, etc. Steroidal lactones (Withanolides: Withanolide A, Withaferin A, Withanolide D, Withanone, etc) isolated from this plant, possess promising medicinal properties such as anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulatory etc. Standardized root extract of the plant NMITLI-118R (NM) was prepared at CSIR-CIMAP, and was investigated for various biological activities at CSIR-CDRI. Among the notable medicinal properties, NM exhibited excellent neuroprotective activity in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model.", "Endothelial dysfunction is the primary event in the cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disorders, present study was thus undertaken to evaluate vasoprotective potential of NM and its biomarker compound Withanolide A (WA) using rat aortic rings and EA.hy926 endothelial cells.", "Transverse aortic rings of 10 weeks old Wistar rats were used to evaluate effect of NM and WA on the vasoreactivity. While, mechanism of NM and WA mediated vasorelaxant was investigated in Ea.hy926\u00a0cell line by measuring NO generation, nitrite content, Serine 1177 phosphorylation of eNOS, reduced/oxidized biopterin levels and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein.", "Fingerprinting of NM using HPLC identified presence of WA in the extract. NM as well as WA exerted moderate vasorelaxant effect in the endothelium intact rat aortic rings which was lesser than acetylcholine (ACh). NM and WA augmented ACh induced relaxation in the rat aortic rings. NM and WA dependent vasorelaxation was blocked by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), indicating role of NO/cGMP. Further Ea.hy926\u00a0cells treated with NM and WA showed accumulation of nitrite content, enhanced NO levels, eNOS expression and eNOS phosphorylation (Serine 1177).", "Altogether NM and WA dependent improvement in the NO availability seems to be mediated by the enhanced eNOS phosphorylation. WA, seems to be one of the active constituent of NM, and presence of other vasoactive substances cannot be ruled out. The data obtained imply that the vasorelaxant property of NM is beneficial for its neuroprotective potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
