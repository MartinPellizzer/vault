Their rates of application are milligrams per hectare instead of kilograms and tons of chemicals traditionally used in agriculture. Also, the glycoside bioregulators are very inexpensive products, being recovered from wastes of canning and pharmaceutical industries. Their application allows the pesticide pressure to be considerable lowered. Steroid glycoside bioregulators can be used as supplements to nutrient media for in vitro culture. The morphogenesis stimulation by glycosides is conditioned by their interaction with phytohormones and depends on the basic medium content. The regulatory effect of glycosides directs the morphogenesis to the increase of shoot formation in the latter stages of growth or to the further activation of callus formation. The stimulation of morphogenesis in vitro under the influence or glycosides and phytohormones of interaction can be explained by using two mechanisms; one involves connection with the permeability of cell membranes, and the other one is connected with the regulation of reactions during the subsequent morphogenetic stages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Genetics, Academy of Science, Chisinau, Moldovia."}], "LastName": "Kintia", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Moldova"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}], "NumberOfReferences": "28"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8957305", "10.1007/978-1-4899-1367-8_27"]}}]}
