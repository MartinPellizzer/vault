The effect of TA/HCl on the skin wound was evaluated through determining closure time and contracting ability of the skin wound, observing histopathological characteristics and measuring contents of hydroxyproline (Hyp) and protein in the wound tissue.", "The closure time of the skin wounds was significantly shorter in the TA/HCl-treated groups than that in the model group. The percentages of wound contraction were higher in the TA/HCl-treated groups than that in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control group of the same group (P<0.05 or P<0.01) on the 3rd to 14th days after wounding. The content of the protein in the wound tissue in the TA/HCl-treated group (2 mg/ml) was higher than that in the model group (P<0.05) on the 3rd to 7th days after wounding, and it arrived at the peak on the 7th day and gradually decreased to the normal level in skin tissue on the 14th to 21st days after wounding. The contents of Hyp in the wound tissues in the TA/HCl-treated groups were higher than that in the model group (P<0.05 or P<0.015) on the 3rd to 21st days after wounding, and they arrived at the peak on the 14th day and at the normal level in skin tissue on the 21st day. Histopathological test results showed that TA/HCl could promote the formation of newly born capillaries in the early period of the wound healing.", "TA/HCl has the ability of promoting skin wound healing in rats, and it can also accelerate the growth of newly born capillaries and raise the production of protein and collagen in wound tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province 710061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ya-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lang-Chong", "Initials": "LC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huai-Hui", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "You", "ForeName": "Hai-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jiao-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "101199657", "ISSNLinking": "1672-1977"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V53XN9L07O", "NameOfSubstance": "taspine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16159575", "10.3736/jcim20050514", "431"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
