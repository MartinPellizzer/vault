The only difference between the chemical structures of the two pigments is that Acetylshikonin has the acetyl radical, while Shikonin does not. Though the activity was slightly different between the two compounds, the pharmacological effect of Shikonin was similar to that of Acetylshikonin. As the two pigments were extracted by ether from Shikon, systemic administration of these pigments showed the same effect as that of ether extract of Shikon as outlined in the first report(1). These compounds had no effect on blood coagulation, but inhibited the anticoagulant effect of heparin in rats. Topical application of both pigments (50 mg of 0.1% ointment) inhibited an increased vascular permeability and acute edema induced by histamine, anti-rat rabbit serum and heat. The activity was similar to that of 0.1% phenylbutazone ointment. On the other hand, these pigments increased proliferation of granuloma tissue in the cotton pellet method and promoted would healing in rats. The results suggest that Shiunko, a main prescription of Shikon, is an effective ointment for cutaneous injuries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Barbiturates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Barbiturates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Coagulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Vessels"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["560339"]}}]}
