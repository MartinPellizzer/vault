However, the association between RHR and metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components remains controversial. We aimed to explore the link between these two parameters.", "The study included 6589 Dong adults (1434 cases of MetS) from the cross-sectional survey of the China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study. Logistic regression model was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assess the association between RHR and MetS, clustered metabolic risk, and MetS components. Restricted cubic splines model was used to evaluate the dose response association.", "A positive association existed between RHR and MetS, and people in the highest RHR quartile had a higher MetS risk (OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.42-2.15]) than those in the lowest quartile. The clustered metabolic risk associated with RHR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, RHR was related to elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated triglycerides (TG) and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG); the ORs (95% CIs) for the highest versus lowest RHR quartile were 2.06 (1.75-2.43), 1.37 (1.17-1.62) and 2.53 (2.04-3.14), respectively. Similar results were found in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Also, non-linear dose response association existed between RHR and MetS and elevated levels of BP, TG and FPG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).", "RHR was related to increased risk of MetS, three MetS components (elevated BP, elevated TG and elevated FPG) and the clustered metabolic risk.
