The Malayali tribes living in the Kolli hills region of Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu has long history of ethnomedicinal knowledge has been remained unexplored hither to. Hence, this study was initiated with an aim to record the ethnomedicinal plants of Malayali tribes and to document and analyse the local knowledge on phytotherapy before environmental and cultural changes deplete the resources.", "In order to document the phytotherapical knowledge, a field study was carried out between August 2012 and February 2014. The ethnomedicinal knowledge was recorded through interviews among the Malayali tribes, and traditional healers. In addition a semi structure questionnaire was used to collect information on the local name of the plant, plant part used for curing, method of preparation in phytoremedies and any other plants/agents used as ingredients. Factor of informant consensus (Fic), use value (UV), fidelity level (FL), relative importance (RI) and novelty index were employed in data analysis.", "Current research work reports total of 86 medicinal plant species belonging to 76 genera of 46 different families. Herbs constituted the largest growth habit (48 species, 56%) followed by trees (13 species, 15%) and shrubs (9 species, 11%) etc. Leaf 43 (46%) is the plant part widely used followed by whole plant 9 (10%), seeds and fruits 9 (10%) and root 7 (8%). Paste was the most common preparation method use in herbal recipes. These plants were used to treat various human diseases and ailments grouped under 19 disease categories with the highest number of species (31) being used for dermatological infections/diseases followed by gastro-intestinal ailments (28) and general health (15). Asystasia chelonoides (UV of 2.76) and Piper nigrum (UV of 2.12) are the most frequently and popularly used medicinal plant species in the study area.", "The result of the study revealed that there was high diversity of medicinal plants and traditional knowledge about the use, preparation, and application of which is still maintained in the study area. However, the knowledge of herbal medicine was held by elders. The decline in the use of plants by the younger generation may gradually lead to the fading away of indigenous knowledge associated with the plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
