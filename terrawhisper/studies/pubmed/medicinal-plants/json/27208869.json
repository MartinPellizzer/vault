Recently, the photoreceptor cell protection of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP), a water extract from Lycium barbarum L. has received more attention. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of LBP on N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced photoreceptor cell apoptosis, and the involvement of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase.", "Photoreceptor cell injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by an intraperitoneal injection of MNU 60mg/kg. Seven days prior to MNU injection, LBP were intragastrical administered daily, rats were sacrificed at 24h and 7 days after MNU injection. Retinal morphologies, photoreceptor cells apoptosis, and protein expression were evaluated at 24h and 7 days after MNU injection.", "Morphologically, the outer nuclear layer was well preserved in the LBP-treated rat retinas throughout the experimental period. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays showed that LBP could significantly suppress the loss of photoreceptor cells, as determined by the photoreceptor cell ratio at the central retina 24h and 7 days after MNU administration. Western-blot analysis demonstrated the expression levels of procaspase-9, -7, -3 and cleaved caspase-9, -7, -3 were upregulated, and PARP were downregulated both 24h and 7 days after MNU injection. LBP treatment significantly decreased protein levels of procaspase and cleaved caspase, increased the level of PARP and cleaved PARP on 24h and 7 days.", "LBP inhibits MNU-induced rat photoreceptor cell apoptosis and protects retinal structure via the regulation of the expressions of PARP and caspase."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
