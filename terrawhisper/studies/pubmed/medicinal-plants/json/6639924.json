These hays were given to four sheep with rumen, duodenal and ileal cannulas, and to a steer with rumen and abomasal cannulas, to investigate the extent and sites of digestion of lignin and phenolic monomers. The hays and digesta samples were analysed for alkali and nitrobenzene-extractable phenolic monomers. Lanthanum oxide was used as an external marker in the digestion studies. Urine was also collected for estimates of total phenolic balance. Grass hays contained greater concentrations of alkali-labile phenolic monomers than did legume hays, whereas legume hays had higher levels of nitrobenzene oxidation products. Mature tall fescue hay had greater concentrations of phenolic monomers than did immature tall fescue hay, but corresponding differences with maturity were not observed with lucerne hays. There were quantitative differences between diets in the digestibilities and in the sites of digestion of phenolic monomers. Digestibilities ranged from 0.191 to 1.004 for alkali-labile compounds and from -1.137 to 0.868 for nitrobenzene oxidation products. Composition of lignin was altered during its passage through the digestive tract. The proportion of phenolic monomers not recovered in urine and faeces varied from -1.014 to 0.871 for individual compounds and differed between diets. Soluble phenolic monomers decreased in concentration as digesta passed from the rumen to the abomasum and duodenum, but increased again in the ileum; levels varied with diet. Phenolics were rapidly solubilized in the rumen after feeding. Results indicate that forages differ in their phenolic monomer content and in the digestibility of these compounds. Therefore, lignin is not an inert compound in the digestive tract of ruminants as has been previously reported."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fahey", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Merchen", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrobenzenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6639924", "10.1079/bjn19830135", "S0007114583001397"]}}]}
