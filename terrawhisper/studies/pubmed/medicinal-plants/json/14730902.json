HPLC separation is performed on a Shim-pack CLC-ODS column (150 mm x 6.0 mm ID, 5 microns) with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile -0.01 mol.L-1 KH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 2.8 with phosphoric acid). The flow rate was 1.0 mL.min-1 and the UV detector was set at 280 nm. The linear range of Danshensu was 0.2-50 mg.L-1 (r = 0.9999), and its limit of detection was 1.5 ng. The mean recovery was 99.4% (RSD = 2.9%).", "The pharmacokinetics of Danshensu after p.o. administration of two kinds of pharmaceutical preparations containing Danshen (with 20 mg of Danshensu) were investigated in 6 healthy human volunteers by determining the Danshensu in urine samples. The elimination half lives (T1/2) of Danshensu after p.o. administration of compound granule preparation A and decoction of Danshen were (0.92 +/- 0.16) h and (0.94 +/- 0.21) h, respectively. Their excretions of Danshensu in urine were (6.2 +/- 2.8)% and (14 +/- 4)% of the dose in 8 hours, respectively.", "Under normal doses, Danshensu can be eliminated from kidney. There is no evident difference on elimination half lives of Danshensu after p.o. administration of the two doses, but the excretions of Danshensu by urine after p.o. administration of compound granule preparation A were lower than that of decoction of Danshen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "Ruo-bing", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4GF33A5PAJ", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-dihydroxyphenyllactic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Lactates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14730902"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
