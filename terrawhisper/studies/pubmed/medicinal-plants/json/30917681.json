The free radical scavenging activity of the acetone, methanol, and aqueous extracts of the fruit, leaf, and root were evaluated against DPPH<sup>+</sup>, ABTS<sup>+</sup>, and phosphomolybdenum. Alkaloid and saponin contents were also determined.", "The acetone extract of the fruit revealed the highest polyphenol content when compared with the other solvent extracts analyzed. Total phenol content of the parts tested ranged from 3.66 \u00b1 0.17 to 44.98 \u00b1 3.41, flavonoid content ranged from 4.63 \u00b1 3.33 to 401.33 \u00b1 7.89, and proanthocyanidin content ranged from 8.84 \u00b1 2.65 to 504 \u00b1 36.6. Significant amount of alkaloids present was observed in the fruits, leaf, and root (10.68 \u00b1 0.68, 14.12 \u00b1 1.67, and 12.15 \u00b1 4.74), respectively, while saponin content was 33.33 \u00b1 11.55, 26.67 \u00b1 11.55, and 20.00 \u00b1 0.00 for the fruit, leaf, and root, respectively. Solvent extracts showed significant antioxidant activity, with acetone showing highest antioxidant ability in correlation with the polyphenol contents. Based on the IC<sub>50</sub> values, acetone extract of the root revealed the best DPPH radical scavenging ability, the leaf aqueous extract had the highest IC<sub>50</sub> value for ABTS, and the methanol extract of the leaf was best for phosphomolybdenum assays.", "This study suggests that fruit, leaf, and root of Cucumis africanus could be a potential source of natural antioxidant and justifies its use in ethnomedicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Abifarin", "ForeName": "Taiwo Oluwafunmilola", "Initials": "TO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "Anthony Jide", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Otunola", "ForeName": "Gloria Aderonke", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101719675", "ISSNLinking": "2515-690X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dinda B, Debnath S, Harigaya Y.
