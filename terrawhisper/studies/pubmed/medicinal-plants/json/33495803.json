In the present study, the aim was to discover natural direct AMPK activators from natural sources, thus a virtual screening for direct AMPK activators was conducted by combining ligand\u2011based and structure\u2011based screening. A common\u2011feature pharmacophore model (HipHop1) was generated with two hydrogen bond acceptor lipid features and one hydrophobic region feature. A total of 1,235 natural products were screened using the HipHop1 hypothesis and CDOCKER protocol successively. According to the docking score, seven hit compounds were selected for AMPK activation assays. Ultimately, (\u2011)\u2011catechin (compound\u00a0522) and licochalcone A (compound 1148) exhibited the highest AMPK activation activity. These findings may contribute to the development of AMPK activators from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of TCM Chemistry and Analysis, Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of TCM Chemistry and Analysis, Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Lifeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, P.R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Activators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.31", "NameOfSubstance": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33495803", "10.3892/mmr.2021.11842", "203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
