The constitutive triterpene saponins, ginsenosides, or panaxosides are attributed to ginseng's miraculous efficacy towards anti-aging, rejuvenating, and immune-potentiating benefits. The major ginsenosides such as Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd., Re, and Rg1, formed after extensive glycosylations of the aglycone \"dammaranediol,\" dominate the chemical profile of this genus in vivo and in vitro. Elicitations have successfully led to appreciable enhancements in the production of these major ginsenosides. However, current research on ginseng biotechnology has been focusing on the enrichment or production of the minor ginsenosides (the less glycosylated precursors of the major ginsenosides) in ginseng preparations, which are either absent or are produced in very low amounts in nature or via cell cultures. The minor ginsenosides under current scientific scrutiny include diol ginsenosides such as Rg3, Rh2, compound K, and triol ginsenosides Rg2 and Rh1, which are being touted as the next \"anti-neoplastic pharmacophores,\" with better bioavailability and potency as compared to the major ginsenosides. This review aims at describing the strategies for ginsenoside production with special attention towards production of the minor ginsenosides from the major ginsenosides via microbial biotransformation, elicitations, and from heterologous expression systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, PO- CIMAP, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Tanya", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, PO- CIMAP, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, PO- CIMAP, Lucknow, 226015, India. archnacimap@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "Archana", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5R89LAS235", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rg2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A9RLM212CY", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside M1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28411325", "10.1007/s00253-017-8279-4", "10.1007/s00253-017-8279-4"]}}]}
