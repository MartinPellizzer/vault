A radar map was used to visually reflect the fertility level of individual indicators. Then,the comprehensive index model was used to calculate the soil fertility quality index( SFQI),and the values of SFQI was used to cluster,and the results showed that MDS was composed of five indicators: organic matter( OM),total phosphate( TP),available phosphorus( Av P),available magnesium( Av Mg) and available ferrum( Av Fe). Radar maps showed that the fertility of available phosphorus( Av P) and available copper( Av Cu) was mostly different in the two town,and the fertility of available ferrum( Av Fe) is smallest different. Except for the effective manganese( Av Mn) fertility level of Huangtugang town was higher than that of Futianhe town,the rest were lower than that of Futianhe town. Through analysis,the sensitivity of SFQI value calculated by taking the contribution rate of MDS index in the principal component of the whole data set( TDS) as the weight was the highest,MDS could better replace TDS. The value of SFQI-MDS ranged from 0. 353 to 0. 833,with an average value of 0. 604 and a coefficient of variation of 22%. The results of SFQI-MDS clustering showed that soil fertility could be divided into four categories: grade \u2160( 0. 727-0. 833) was superior,accounting for 25. 0%,grade \u2161( 0. 615-0. 681)was good,accounting for 29. 2%,mainly distributed in Futianhe Town,grade \u2162( 0. 494-0. 589) was medium,accounting for29. 1%,and grade \u2163( 0. 353-0. 419) was poor,accounting for 16. 7%,mainly distributed in Huangtugang town. Soil fertility of Futianhe town was better than that of Huangtugang town. It is suggested that boron fertilizer and potassium fertilizer should be supplemented to Chrysanthemum morifolium in production practice,and the amount of phosphate fertilizer,magnesium fertilizer and nitrogen fertilizer should be increased appropriately. At the same time,the amount of organic fertilizer should be increased to enhance soil fertility and improve soil physical and chemical properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Faculty,Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Faculty,Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hong-Yuan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Pharmacology Laboratory,Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025,China."}], "LastName": "Ou", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs Breeding Base,Institute of Chinese Material Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Faculty,Hubei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Wuhan 430065,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Da-Hui", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237384", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191101.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
