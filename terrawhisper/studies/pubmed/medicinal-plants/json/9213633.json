A critical component of the Institute's mission is the identification and development of new and promising treatments for cancer and AIDS. For many years these efforts have included a program to investigate natural products for potential new therapeutic agents. In 1986, with the advent of new screening techniques, the National Cancer Institute stepped up its exploration of natural products and began world-wide collections of plants in tropical and subtropical regions. In recognition of the principles of the Biodiversity Treaty, NCI appreciates that continued access to the natural products of these countries depends on the Institute's ability to recognize the contributions of these source countries and their indigenous peoples, and to provide them adequate incentives to conserve their natural resources for the purposes of drug discovery. Accomplishing this goal presented several legal issues for the National Cancer Institute. As an agency of the US government, the NCI has an adjunct statutory mission to facilitate the transfer of technology developed through the Institute's programs into the private sector for further development and commercialization, and NCI operates under a national policy to use the patent system to transfer Federally supported research to the private domestic sector. Reliance on patent law may limit the Institute's ability to recognize the rights of source countries and their indigenous people and provide compensation for their contributions. However, other legal instruments, such as contracts, can serve as interim measures to provide compensation to source countries and indigenous populations. The National Cancer Institute's Letter of Collection agreement (LOC, formerly the \"Letter of Intent'), is an example of an alternative means that \"fills-in the gaps' created by patent law and through which source countries may share in the benefits of natural product development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Technology Development, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."}], "LastName": "Mays", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mazan", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics", "legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Entrepreneurship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intellectual Property"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Licensure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "National Institutes of Health (U.S.)"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence", "organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Policy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology Transfer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "NumberOfReferences": "14"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9213633", "10.1016/0378-8741(95)01352-0", "0378-8741(95)01352-0"]}}]}
