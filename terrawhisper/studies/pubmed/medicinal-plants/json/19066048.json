In order to change the situation that there is few information in plenty of data and to obtain useful knowledge which has high information content, it is necessary to clean data and ensure data's accuracy and without noise off when database is established initially. High-quality data comes from high-quality data source. But incomplete and incorrect and irregular data exist widely in the data source of Chinese materia medica. The phenomenon of synonyms and homonym is quite serious, and there is no unified description for the name and origin of Chinese materia medica among different data sources. So data processing including data analysis and research is very important in the establishment of Chinese materia medica database. In order to get the most accurate and standard data, this paper analyzed the items of Medical Plants in Xiandai Bencao Gangmu, including classification analysis of medical plants: distribution analysis of different classes and analysis of medical part; analysis of synonyms and homonym; analysis of incorrect data and analysis of advantage and disadvantage of data sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Information Management of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fuzhou 350003, China. ldy-ftjcm@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Duan-yi", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Chang-en", "Initials": "CE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lai", "ForeName": "Xin-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shu-jing", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Books, Medical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19066048"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
