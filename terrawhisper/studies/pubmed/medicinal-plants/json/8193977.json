However, it is not known whether and to what extent these habits are practised by Asian people in the United Kingdom. Home based interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were undertaken among 296 first generation Bangladeshi women resident in inner-city Leeds and Bradford, West Yorkshire. 'Pan' was reportedly chewed by 282 (95 per cent) of the women, of whom 174 (62 per cent) added tobacco in leaf form, and 75 (27 per cent) as a component of zarda. Those who consumed more 'pans' daily were significantly older, less literate, had a lower educational attainment, and were more likely to believe that chewing betel quid was beneficial. Cigarette smoking was practised by 9 per cent, this group being older and having lived in the UK longer. Burnt tobacco leaves were used as an oral hygiene aid by 20 per cent. Over half (58 per cent) of the sample had never visited a dentist, the majority deeming it unnecessary. The use of tobacco and 'pan' imply an increased risk for oral cancer and precancer. Since 'pan' chewing is a traditional custom, health promotion within these communities would require a sensitive approach. Health personnel likely to be consulted by Asian groups who chew 'pan' should be aware of the danger to oral health posed by this practice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Child Dental Health, University of Leeds, UK."}], "LastName": "Summers", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Curzon", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8411261", "ISSNLinking": "0265-539X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Habits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services Needs and Demand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Women"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8193977"]}}]}
