Since degradation of collagen by fibroblast phagocytosis is an important pathway for physiological remodelling of soft connective tissues, we have investigated phagocytosis of collagen- and fibronectin-coated latex beads by fibroblast cultures with an in vitro model system. Coated fluorescent latex beads were incubated with human oral mucosa fibroblasts and the fluorescence associated with internalized beads was measured by flow cytometry. Cells from normal tissues that had been incubated with beads for 16 h contained a mean of 75% collagen phagocytic cells and 70% fibronectin phagocytic cells; however, about 15% and 10% of phagocytic cells individually contained more than twice the mean number of beads per cell. In contrast, cells from OSF tissues exhibited a 40% reduction of the proportions of collagen phagocytic cells (mean=35%) and a 48% decrease of the proportions of fibronectin phagocytic cells (mean=22%), none of the cells having a high number of beads as compared to normal fibroblasts. OSF lesions appear to contain fibroblasts with marked deficiencies in collagen and fibronectin phagocytosis. To investigate if inhibition of phagocytosis could be demonstrated in vitro, normal fibroblast cultures were incubated with areca nut alkaloids (arecoline, arecaidine). The cultures had a dose-dependent reduction in the proportions of phagocytic cells. On the other hand, corticosteroid used in the treatment of OSF exhibited a dose-dependent enhancement in the proportion of phagocytic cells. Therefore, our hypothesis for OSF, although oversimplified, is that betel nut alkaloids (arecoline, arecaidine) inhibit fibroblast phagocytosis and this provides a mechanism for the development of OSF. The benefit of a local intralesional injection of corticosteroid is also possibly, at least in part, through an enhancement of fibroblast collagen phagocytosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical College, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shieh", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibronectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0S8YEV0D4O", "NameOfSubstance": "arecaidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1ZK20VI6TY", "NameOfSubstance": "Triamcinolone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4ALN5933BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Arecoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Arecoline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibronectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triamcinolone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9950251", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1999.tb01997.x"]}}]}
