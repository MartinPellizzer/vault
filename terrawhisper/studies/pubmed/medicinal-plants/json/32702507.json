All treatment decisions depend on the pattern of biomarkers selection to enhance the response to the targeted therapies. Although advanced treatments are available for lung-cancer, the disease treatment remains not adequate. There are several synthetic chemotherapeutic agents available for the treatment of lung cancer. However, due to their toxic effect, survival rate is still 15-18%. Besides, medicinal plants are a huge reservoir of natural products that provide protective effects against lung cancer. Likewise, successful studies of potential phytochemicals in targeting lung-cancer biomarkers have created a novel paradigm for the discovery of potent drugs against lung-cancer. Hence, to defeat severe toxicity and resistance towards the synthetic drugs, detailed studies are required regarding the available phytochemicals and targets responsible for the treatment of lung-cancer. The present review provides a comprehensive information about the lung-cancer biomarkers under the classification of predictive, prognostic, and diagnostic type. Moreover, it discusses and enlists the phytochemicals with mode of action against different biomarkers, effective doses in in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies, the limitations associated with usage of phytochemicals as a drug to prevent/cure lung-cancer and the latest techniques employed to overcome such issues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
