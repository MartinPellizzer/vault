However, its poor water solubility causes low oral bioavailability and poor absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting its practical applications. Encapsulation is an efficient approach to overcome these limitations. This study demonstrates the encapsulation of vitexin into poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether-grafted chitosan (mPEG-g-CTS)/alginate (ALG) polyelectrolyte complex nanoparticles.", "The vitexin-loaded mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The vitexin-loaded mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles had a spherical shape, 50-200\u2009nm in diameter, and negatively charged surface (-27 to -38\u2009mV). They possessed a loading capacity of 4-60%, encapsulation efficiency of 50-100% and antioxidant activity (30-52% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl decoloration) when their initial vitexin content was 0.02-0.64\u2009g\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> polymers. Successful vitexin loading into mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles was also indirectly confirmed by the enhanced thermal stability of both polymers and the residual soybean oil used in the emulsion preparation step and delayed oxidative degradation of the residual soybean oil. Vitexin's in vitro release from the mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles was very fast in phosphate buffer at pH\u200911, followed by pH\u20097, and very slow in acetate buffer at pH\u20093. The gastrointestinal digestion of vitexin increased by encapsulating into mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles.", "Vitexin-loaded mPEG-g-CTS/ALG nanoparticles were successfully fabricated using a two-step process of oil-in-water emulsion and ionic gelation without the use of pungent odor acids and other crosslinkers. The obtained nanoparticles are suitable for oral intestinal-specific delivery systems. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5115-1082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Packaging and Materials Technology, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Studies for Agriculture and Food, Kasetsart University Institute for Advanced Studies, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Yoksan", "ForeName": "Rangrong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Packaging and Materials Technology, Faculty of Agro-Industry, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Towongphaichayonte", "ForeName": "Pawika", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "FF[KU]23.64", "Agency": "Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9004-74-4", "NameOfSubstance": "monomethoxypolyethylene glycol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9VP70K75OK", "NameOfSubstance": "vitexin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alginates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-22-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Soybean Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alginates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soybean Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Cao D, Li H, Yi J, Zhang J, Che H, Cao J et al., Antioxidant properties of the mung bean flavonoids on alleviating heat stress.
