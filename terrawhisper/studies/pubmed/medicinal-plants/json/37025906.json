Unfortunately, there is a dearth of study on pregnant women in Ethiopia who concomitantly utilize pharmaceutical drugs and medicinal plants. Hence, the objective of this research was to assess the concomitant use of pharmaceutical drugs and medicinal plants among pregnant women in Southern Ethiopia in 2021.", "A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among systematically selected 400 pregnant women in Shashamane town, Southern Ethiopia, from July 1-30/2021. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Binary logistic regression was performed to examine the association between a dependent variable and independent variables.", "According to this study, among those who self-medicated, 90 (22.5%) reported using at least one pharmaceutical drug, while 180 (45%) reported using at least one medicinal plant. Moreover, 68 (17%) of the participants who had taken drugs while pregnant also used pharmaceutical drugs and medicinal plants concomitantly. Having a medical condition during pregnancy (AOR\u00a0=\u00a05.6, 95% CI: 2.7-11.6), not having ANC follow up (AOR\u00a0=\u00a02.9, 95% CI: 1.3-6.2), gestational age (AOR\u00a0=\u00a04.2, 95% CI: 1.6-10.7), and not having a formal education (AOR\u00a0=\u00a04.2, 95% CI: 1.3-13.4) were all significantly associated with concomitant use of pharmaceutical drugs and medicinal plants during pregnancy.", "This study showed that nearly one in five pregnant women used medicinal plants concomitantly with pharmaceutical drugs. Mother's educational status, medical illness during pregnancy, having ANC follow up and gestational period were significantly associated with concomitant use of medicinal plants and pharmaceutical drugs. Therefore, health care providers and concerned stakeholders should consider these factors to minimize the risks associated with drug use during pregnancy on both mother and fetus."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Bekele", "ForeName": "Gemechu Gelan", "Initials": "GG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Hawassa University, Hawassa, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Woyo", "ForeName": "Terefe", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Fekene", "ForeName": "Daniel Belema", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Gonfa", "ForeName": "Dajane Negesse", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Moti", "ForeName": "Berhanu Ejara", "Initials": "BE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Roga", "ForeName": "Ephrem Yohannes", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Yami", "ForeName": "Amare Tesfaye", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Bacha", "ForeName": "Amente Jorise", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ambo University, Ambo, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Kabale", "ForeName": "Wogene Daro", "Initials": "WD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Gyarmathy V., et al.
