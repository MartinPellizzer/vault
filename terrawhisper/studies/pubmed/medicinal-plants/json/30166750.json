The aim of the study was designed to evaluate the chemical composition and antioxidant and biological properties of different fractions obtained from <i>A. viridis</i>.", "Four different extracts of <i>A. viridis</i> were prepared using aqueous, methanol, chloroform, and hexane and investigated their antioxidant potential using free radical scavenging activities such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging activity, as well as metal chelating activity. In addition, antityrosinase and antigenotoxicity properties were also evaluated by the standard <i>in vitro</i> methods. Finally, the active methanolic extract (ME) was investigated for identifying the phenolic compounds using UPLC-MS/MS.", "In the present study, chlorogenic acid, gulonic acid, and kaempferol were found to be the major components responsible for the antioxidant activity of <i>A. viridis</i> extract as evidenced from UPLC-MS/MS. Furthermore, the ME of <i>A. viridis</i> revealed excellent antioxidant activities such as DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 47.23 \u00b1 0.66 \u03bcg/mL), NO radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 64.33 \u00b1 2.01 \u03bcg/mL), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 33.21 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcg/mL), ABTS radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 47.61 \u00b1 1.31 \u03bcg/mL), metal chelating activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 32.1 \u00b1 1.11 \u03bcg/mL), as well as lipid peroxidation inhibiting activity (IC<sub>50</sub>= 112 \u00b1 1.21 \u03bcg/mL). Furthermore, ME revealed that the protective effects of extract were observed on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced DNA damages with alkaline comet assay.", "Taken together, the study concluded that the promising antioxidant capacities of <i>A. viridis</i> extract can further be utilized in various agricultural, pharmaceutical, and food applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, Biochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology, Guwahati, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Sima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, Drug Discovery Laboratory, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology, Guwahati, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Elancheran", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences, Biochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology, Guwahati, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Rajlakshmi", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902477", "ISSNLinking": "0253-7613"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.18.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Monophenol Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}], "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Shamala S, Gunasekaran B, Shukor MY, Bakarb MZ, Ahmad SA.
