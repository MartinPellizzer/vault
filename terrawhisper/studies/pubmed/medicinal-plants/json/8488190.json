These cultures synthesize and secrete for at least two weeks various lipids from [14C]-acetic and [14C]-oleic acid. Exposure for one or two weeks to 10 micrograms/ml of alpha-asarone decreased the secretion of various lipids to the culture medium; triacylglycerol secretion was inhibited by 80-97%, phospholipid secretion by 70-87%, cholesterol by 64-70%, and cholesterol esters by 50-92%. The incorporation of [14C]-acetic acid into cellular lipids decreased by 30-81% and that of [14C]-oleic acid into phospholipids by 25-47% whereas the incorporation of [14C]-oleic acid into triglycerides and cholesterol esters increased 3.2 fold and by 28-36%, respectively. Similarly, the activities of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme, marker enzymes of glycerolipid and fatty acid synthesis, decreased by 22-50% and 30-76%, respectively. Our results show that the exposure of the 3T3-hepatocyte cultures to micromolar concentrations of alpha-asarone significantly inhibits lipid secretion and probably lipid synthesis. They also suggest that at least part of the hypolipidemic effect could be due to a decrease in the secretion of lipids (i.e., lipoproteins) by the hepatocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Toxicology Department, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Estudios Avanzados del IPN, M\u00e9xico D.F."}], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chamorro", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mendoza-Figueroa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "asarone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8488190", "10.1055/s-2006-959625"]}}]}
