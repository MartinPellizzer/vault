Here, we report that Arabidopsis CHLOROPLAST AND NUCLEUS DUAL-LOCALIZED PROTEIN 1 (CND1) maintains genome stability in the chloroplast and the nucleus. CND1 localizes to both compartments, and complete loss of CND1 results in embryo lethality. Partial loss of CND1 disturbs nuclear cell-cycle progression and photosynthetic activity. CND1 binds to nuclear pre-replication complexes and DNA replication origins and regulates nuclear genome stability. In chloroplasts, CND1 interacts with and facilitates binding of the regulator of chloroplast genome stability WHY1 to chloroplast DNA. The defects in nuclear cell-cycle progression and photosynthesis of cnd1 mutants are respectively rescued by compartment-restricted CND1 localization. Light promotes the association of CND1 with HSP90 and its import into chloroplasts. This study provides a paradigm of the convergence of genome status across organelles to coordinately regulate cell cycle to control plant growth and development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
