Several types of carriers such as neutral, anionic, cationic, macrocyclic and supramulecular carriers are discussed. Also their application for metal, anions, drugs and environmental compounds are investigated. Carriers have been demonstrated to be useful for the selective extraction and recovery of numerous cations and anions enhancing the extraction properties of traditional solvent extraction and ion-exchange processes. Several types of carriers have different transport mechanisms. In these mechanisms, transport con\ufb01gurations are addressed and emphasized and the detailed information on the type of carrier are presented along with their speci\ufb01c separation modes. The performance of different carriers in terms of selectivity as well as efficiency are also discussed. Finally, the application of different carriers for the extraction of various compounds are compared and reviewed. To our best knowledge no reviews have been published on carrier-mediated extraction methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
