Various types of traditional and complementary therapies, primarily phytotherapy, can be used for prevention and treatment of many diseases and conditions, including GI complaints. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of use of medicinal herbs in treatment and prevention of GI disorders, together with their efficacy and safety.", "A prospective, repeated cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in the form of a specifically created questionnaire, filled in by consumers and/or patients in pharmacies on the territory of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia. All data were statistically analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2007.", "In the total number of 1137 patients, 10.4% declared themselves as consumers of phytopreparations for GI disorders. The most common diseases were constipation (44%) and dyspepsia (23%). The most frequently used preparations contained laxatives (with both anthraquinones and dietary fibers), artichoke and silymarin. Iberogast\u00ae was also frequently used. Pharmacists were the main source of recommendation for the most adequate herbal remedies. At the same time, phytopreparations were well tolerated, with no major side effects, and were evidently or presumably effective.", "Some mild and moderate GI disorders seem to be treated frequently with phytopreparatons. Various herbal remedies are well accepted by patients, and the phytopreparations seem to have favorable ratio of safety and efficacy. Further integration into conventional medicine will improve the quality of the products used and provide a rational plan of use of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
