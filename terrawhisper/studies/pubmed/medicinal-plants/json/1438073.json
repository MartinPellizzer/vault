The traditional process for the production and microbiological characteristics of the condiment were investigated. During laboratory fermentation that lasted 96 h, the mesquite seeds underwent a natural fermentation that was characterised by the growth of microorganisms to 10(6)-10(8) cfu/g. Several species of bacteria especially B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus spp were found to be the most actively involved organisms. However, significant contributions to the microbial ecology were made by Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Lactobacillus spp were present in low numbers towards the end of the fermentation. The presence of Proteus and Pseudomonas spp in traditional fermented samples demonstrate the variability which may exist in the microflora of individual fermented samples. Variations in the important microbial groups show that Bacillus spp were the most prevalent species and occurred until the end of fermentation. Temperature, pH and titratable acidity varied with time and were influenced by the metabolic activities of the microorganisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science Technology, Federal Polytechnic, Idah, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Achi", "ForeName": "O K", "Initials": "OK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Condiments"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacter cloacae"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Micrococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Proteus"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus epidermidis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1991 Jan;41(1):27-34", "ArticleIdList": ["1673237"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1970 Jul-Aug;18(4):576-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5433991"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1438073", "10.1007/BF02194090"]}}]}
