Some of these derivatives have greater antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in tested cell lines than parent compound DHA. The structures of the all compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR and mass spectral data. Among the new derivatives, compounds 8, 14, 15, 20 and 24 were found to be more active than parent DHA against tested human cancer cell lines. DHA derivatives were found to be most active in human leukemia cell lines with compounds 8, 14, 15, 20 and 24 showed IC50 values less than 1\u00a0\u03bcM for 48\u00a0h whereas DHA has IC50 value of 2\u00a0\u03bcM\u00a0at same time period. The most potent compounds 8 with IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM (at par with doxorubicin (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM)) and 15 with IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcM, of the series, six and three times active than DHA (with IC50\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0\u03bcM) respectively were selected for further mechanistic work in human leukemia HL-60\u00a0cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
