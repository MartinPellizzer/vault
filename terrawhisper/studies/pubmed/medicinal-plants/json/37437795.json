Considering the huge Brazilian biodiversity, many plants are traditionally used for aphrodisiac purposes. However, the use of native medicinal plants as sexual boosters in Brazil has been poorly studied.", "This review focuses on the composition, pharmacology, and results of experimental trials of the main native plants used in Brazilian folk medicine with alleged aphrodisiac effects. We aimed to provide a state-of-the-art reference for research on herbs for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction by summarizing and discussing the main studies found.", "The relevant information was collected by searching keywords (aphrodisiac, sexual tonic, sexual stimulant, sexual vigor stimulant, sexual impotency, erectile dysfunction, etc.) from books containing primary surveys conducted in the original communities and bibliographic surveys prepared by authors linked to the national academic and scientific environment edited in Brazil. Preclinical and clinical studies of the compiled plant species were performed using scientific databases (Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, and SciFinder).", "Seventy-four plant species belonging to 44 families used in Brazil to treat sexual dysfunction were compiled from ethnopharmacological literature. Fourteen plants, including Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen, Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco Schltdl., Anemopaegma arvense (Vell.) Stellfeld ex de Souza, Mimosa pudica L., Heteropterys tomentosa A. Juss., Trichilia catigua A. Juss., and Turnera diffusa Willd. ex Schult. were pharmacologically studied to confirm these therapeutic properties. Probable modes of action include antioxidant and androgenic activities, inhibition of the PDE5 enzyme, increase in NO levels, and activation of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways. In addition, several different species popularly known as \"catuaba\" were identified, leading to adulterations and controversial effects.", "The overall results of the present review of Brazilian folk literature reveal that Brazil has a long tradition of using plants with potential aphrodisiac effects.
