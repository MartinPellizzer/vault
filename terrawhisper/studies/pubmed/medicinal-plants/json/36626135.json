Somatic embryos were then encapsulated in 3% sodium alginate, 0.85 M sucrose and 100 mM calcium chloride for synthetic seed production and subjected to cryopreservation. Marker medicinal compounds were determined by RP-HPLC analysis.", "A medium containing 1 mg/L 2,4-D+ 0.5 mg/L BAP+ 0.5 mg/L TDZ was found to stimulate the highest callus induction. Somatic embryos were recovered after 5 weeks, when cultured on the same media. Synthetic seeds were dehydrated and immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 h. Cryopreserved synthetic seeds were successfully revived and germinated on MS media supplemented with 1 mg/L IBA+ 2 mg/L KN + 3 mg/L GA3 in which 93.3% somatic embryos differentiated into shoots. One month old in-vitro grown shoots from cryopreserved somatic embryos had similar marker medicinal compounds, such as amarogentin (4.72 \u00b1 0.11 ug/mg) and mangiferin (14.54 \u00b1 0.05 ug/mg), as control material.", "This protocol offers vast scope for multiplying material of an endangered medicinal herb and subsequent cryopreservation. doi.org/10.54680/fr22510110612."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jaypee University of Information Technology, Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh. 173234, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jaypee University of Information Technology, Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Waknaghat, Solan, Himachal Pradesh. 173234, India. hemant.sood@juit.ac.in."}], "LastName": "Sood", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cryo Letters", "NlmUniqueID": "9891832", "ISSNLinking": "0143-2044"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dehydration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swertia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "26"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36626135"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
