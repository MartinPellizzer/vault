In this study, the enhancing effect of gamma irradiation on plant growth parameters of S.\u00a0marianum under salt stress was investigated. The effect of gamma irradiation, either as a single elicitor or coupled with salinity, on chalcone synthase (CHS) gene expression and silybin A\u00a0+\u00a0B yield was also evaluated. The silybin A\u00a0+\u00a0B content in S.\u00a0marianum fruits was estimated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An increase in silybin content was accompanied by up-regulation of the CHS1, CHS2 and CHS3 genes, which are involved in the silybin biosynthetic pathway. The highest silybin A\u00a0+\u00a0B production (0.77\u00a0g/100\u00a0g plant DW) and transcript levels of the three studied genes (100.2-, 91.9-, and 24.3-fold increase, respectively) were obtained with 100GY gamma irradiation and 4000\u00a0ppm salty water. The CHS2 and CHS3 genes were partially sequenced and submitted to the NCBI database under the accession numbers KT252908.1 and KT252909.1, respectively. Developing new approaches to stimulate silybin biosynthetic pathways could be a useful tool to potentiate the use of plants as renewable resources of medicinal compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
