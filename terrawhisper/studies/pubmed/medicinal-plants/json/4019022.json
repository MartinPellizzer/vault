The thermal stability of this protein in aqueous solution was much greater at pH 3 than at pH 8 or pH 11. Evidence from u.v. absorption and from circular dichroism indicated that irreversible conformation changes occurred at higher temperature (greater than 70 degrees). Circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion studies at pH 8 show that the inhibitor is rich in beta-structure and virtually devoid of alpha-helix in aqueous solution. We conclude from experiments with denaturing solvents that the inhibitor is very stable and that high concentrations of denaturant are required before unfolding occurs. Chemical modification experiments with tetranitromethane were consistent with a tight stable structure; even in 6M guanidine hydrochloride only three of the five tyrosine residues in the inhibitor molecule were nitrated. However, tyrosine does not seem to be implicated at the reactive site of the inhibitor. Interaction of the inhibitor with alpha-chymotrypsin and chymotrypsin B was also followed by difference spectroscopy in the ultraviolet region. Difference spectra were detected that were characteristic of changes in the environment of both tyrosine and tryptophan chromophores. Comparison of the spectral data obtained for the interaction of the inhibitor with bovine alpha-chymotrypsin and with chymotrypsin B indicated that a tryptophan residue may be involved at the reactive site of the inhibitor. Spectral changes were also detected for the interaction between the chymotrypsin inhibitor and trypsin, although it is well established that the specificity of this inhibitor is restricted to the chymotrypsins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gruen", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kortt", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Int J Pept Protein Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0330420", "ISSNLinking": "0367-8377"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Rotatory Dispersion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Denaturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4019022", "10.1111/j.1399-3011.1985.tb02190.x"]}}]}
