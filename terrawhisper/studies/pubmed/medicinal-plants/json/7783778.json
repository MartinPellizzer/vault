The processes studied were fermentation, germination, pressure-cooking and roasting. The dietary fibre (DF) content and its components were determined using the enzymatic-gravimetric method. The TS content was determined by the enzymatic method after solubilization with KOH. The DF content ranged from 23.2 to 25.6 g/100 g in the raw and 16.0 to 31.5 g/100 g in the processed legumes. All the processing treatments significantly decreased the SDF content and increased the IDF content of all the three legumes. The mean TS, AS and RS content of the raw legumes were similar, 46.9, 36.7 and 10.2 g/100 g respectively. AS content of all the legumes was reduced by the processing treatments, except pressure cooking. Correspondingly, higher amounts of RS were observed in the processed legumes, except pressure cooked, resulting in an increase in the TDF content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, University of Mysore, India."}], "LastName": "Veena", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Urooj", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Puttaraj", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7783778", "10.1002/food.19950390206"]}}]}
