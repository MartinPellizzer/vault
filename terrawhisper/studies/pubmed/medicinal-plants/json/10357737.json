We recently validated a noninvasive technique in pigs, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp plus oral carbohydrate loading (OC-Clamp), to quantify the rate of net posthepatic appearance of glucose after ingestion of carbohydrates.", "The OC-Clamp procedure was performed in 8 healthy men to compare the net posthepatic appearance of glucose after ingestion of 1 of 3 carbohydrates.", "Human volunteers underwent the OC-Clamp procedure at an insulin infusion rate of 1.5 mU x kg(-1) x min(-1) (n = 5). The oral carbohydrate load (1 g/kg) consisted of glucose, cornstarch, or mung bean starch. During the OC-Clamp procedure, the glucose infusion rate decreased during absorption to maintain plasma glucose steady state and the decrease reflected the net posthepatic appearance of glucose. In addition, carbohydrates were loaded without insulin infusion (n = 6) and glycemic indexes were calculated (with glucose as the reference).", "The mean (+/-SEM) glycemic index of cornstarch was higher (95 +/- 18) than that of mung bean starch (51 +/- 13). In the OC-Clamp experiments, the posthepatic appearance of glucose and cornstarch did not differ significantly and represented 79.4 +/- 5.0% and 72.6 +/- 4.0%, respectively, of the load after complete absorption (within 3 h). In contrast, the net posthepatic appearance of glucose from mung bean starch was significantly lower (35.6 +/- 4.6% of the load, P < 0.001) than that from glucose and cornstarch, even 4.5 h postprandially.", "The OC-Clamp technique allows a continuous assessment of net posthepatic appearance of glucose after ingestion of carbohydrates and significant discrimination between corn and mung bean starches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INSERM U 341, Service de Diab\u00e9tologie, H\u00f4pital H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Paris, France."}], "LastName": "Lang", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bornet", "ForeName": "F R", "Initials": "FR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vaugelade", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Ypersele de Strihou", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pacher", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rossi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "La Droitte", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du\u00e9e", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Slama", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Peptide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "C-Peptide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Clamp Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10357737", "10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1183"]}}]}
