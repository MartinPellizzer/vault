To test this hypothesis four AT and four normal fibroblast cultures were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the induction of micronucleated cells was assayed. AT cultures responded to the H2O2 treatment with a greater increase in micronucleus frequencies than that observed in normal cultures (P less than 0.01). At time course study showed that an elevation in micronucleus frequencies occurred earlier in AT cultures (significant increase by 1.5 h after treatment) than in normal cultures, possibly indicating a G2-phase sensitivity of AT cells to H2O2. The addition of an aqueous extract of areca nut to the cultures, as an example of exogenous stress, induced a greater frequency of micronucleated cells in AT cultures than in the normal cultures. These results suggest that the AT syndrome may serve as a model for investigating the role of reduced oxygen species in cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Kinesiology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosin", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3CHI920QS7", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochalasin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ataxia Telangiectasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochalasin B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2208088", "10.1016/0304-3835(90)90089-g", "0304-3835(90)90089-G"]}}]}
