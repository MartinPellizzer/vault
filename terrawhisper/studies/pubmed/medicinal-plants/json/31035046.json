In addition, standardized treatment for uterine sarcoma has not yet been established due to its rarity and heterogeneity.", "We investigated the apoptotic cell death of uterine sarcoma cells (SK-UT-1B) induced by Gyejibokryunghwan (GBH). GBH, an herbal medicine, has been widely used for gynecological diseases in Koean medicine.", "SK-UT-1B cells were treated with GBH of varying concentrations from 0 to 500 \u00b5g/ml. The mechanism of cell death was investigated through multiple analysis methods, including flow cytometry, cell cycle, and western blotting.", "Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the number of apoptotic cells increased in a GBH dose-dependent manner. The cell populations of sub-G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phases were increased by GBH treatment, indicating apoptosisand cell arrest, while the population of S and G<sub>2</sub>/M phases decreased. With GBH, the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, -6, and -9 were upregulated, while the expression levels of pro-caspase-3, -6, and -9 were down-regulated in SK-UT-1B cells.", "These results are the first observation of uterine sarcoma cell death induced by GBH and confirmation of the mechanism of cell death, which occurred through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Clinically, uterine sarcoma has a poor prognosis with no appropriate treatment. GBH may become a new treatment modality for uterine sarcoma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..
