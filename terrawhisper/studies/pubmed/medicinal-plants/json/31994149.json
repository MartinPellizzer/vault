Recently, it has been reported that <i>Kalanchoe</i> plants have cytotoxic properties; however, data on traditional use of these plants in tumor treatment are extremely limited. <i>Kalanchoe daigremontiana</i> is one of the most popular species cultivated in Europe, and it is used, among other things, as a remedy in treating skin injuries and wounds. Studies on the biological activity of this species are scarce, and there is a lack of data on the cytotoxic activity of <i>K. daigremontiana</i> extracts on epithelial cancer cells in the literature. In our present study, we analyzed the phytochemical composition of <i>K. daigremontiana</i> ethanol extract and fractions-water and dichloromethane-by the HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS method and estimated cytotoxic activity of the extracts on human adenocarcinoma (HeLa), ovarian (SKOV-3), breast (MCF-7), and melanoma (A375) cell lines by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, real-time cell analyzer (RTCA), and flow cytometry. We identified 6 bufadienolide compounds and 19 flavonoids, mostly kaempferol, quercetin, isorhamnetin, and myricetin glycosides, of which only 3 flavonoids have been identified in <i>K. daigremontiana</i> to date. Other flavonoids that were characterized in our study have not yet been found in this plant. The ethanol extract and water fraction of <i>K. daigremontiana</i> did not show significant cytotoxic activity on the tested cell lines. In contrast, the dichloromethane fraction showed the strongest activity against all cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of \u2264\u200910\u2009\u00b5g/mL. The results indicated that this activity is mainly due to the presence of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Stefanowicz-Hajduk", "ForeName": "Justyna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Asztemborska", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Krauze-Baranowska", "ForeName": "Miros\u0142awa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Godlewska", "ForeName": "Sylwia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Gucwa", "ForeName": "Magdalena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Crop Quality, Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, State Research Institute, Pu\u0142awy, Poland."}], "LastName": "Moniuszko-Szajwaj", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Crop Quality, Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation, State Research Institute, Pu\u0142awy, Poland."}], "LastName": "Stochmal", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Ochocka", "ForeName": "J Renata", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bufanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bufanolides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kalanchoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31994149", "10.1055/a-1099-9786"]}}]}
