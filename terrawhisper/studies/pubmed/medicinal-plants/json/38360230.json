Nanoparticle-stabilized emulsion (Pickering emulsion) gels are colloidal systems with ability to accommodate two immiscible phases in one system. The thick adsorption nanoparticle layers and the cross-linked networks in continuous phase could provide protective barriers for antibacterial oil and achieve on-demand controlled release. An emulsion hydrogel templated from gelatin nanoparticle-stabilized emulsion is one-pot constructed by conducting a tunable cross-linking process between oxidized dextran (Odex) and amikacin in the continuous phase and concomitantly trapping tea tree essential oil (TO) droplets in the three-dimensional network. The resulted emulsion hydrogel presents tunable gelation time, adequate mechanical strength, fascinating injectability, and self-healing capability. It is pH-responsiveness and presents controlled release of amikacin and TO, exhibiting a long-term bacteriostasis of 144\u00a0h. The emulsion hydrogel facilitates the outstanding wound healing efficiency in 14\u00a0days (95.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0% of wound closure), accompanied with enhanced collagen deposition and angiogenic activities. The incorporation of TO into emulsion hydrogel system reduced its irritation and improved its biosafety, showing potential application in bacteria inhibition even as implants in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
