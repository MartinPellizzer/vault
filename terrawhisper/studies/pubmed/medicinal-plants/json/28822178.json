There were more species in the two dominant families, Asteraceae and Rosaceae. There were many types of associated, but most appeared at a low frequency. The vegetation type were mostly herbaceous and shrub species, which accounted for 77.6% of the total species. The value of t was greater than t0.05 by methods of variance/mean, showed the difference was significant and the distribution pattern of D. asperoides were cluster distribution. The determination results of seven aggregation intensity index also showed that D. asperoides population accorded with the characteristics of cluster distribution\uff08C>1\uff0cK>0\uff0cCa>0\uff0cm*>1\uff0cm*/m>1\uff0cI>0\uff0cGI>0\uff09."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Fine Variety Breeding Techniques of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0cChongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Da-Xia", "Initials": "DX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation, Chongqing 404100, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Si-Rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Fine Variety Breeding Techniques of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0cChongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Fine Variety Breeding Techniques of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0cChongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Fine Variety Breeding Techniques of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0cChongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Guang-Lin", "Initials": "GL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Engineering Research Center for Fine Variety Breeding Techniques of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0cChongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource, Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Long-Yun", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Dipsacaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28822178", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0105"]}}]}
