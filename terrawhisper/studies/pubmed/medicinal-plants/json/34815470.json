The surface morphology of meso-CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was highly porous with nanometric size and non-homogeneous surface. The specific surface area, total pore volume, and BJH pore diameter of meso-CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> were 148.5 m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, 1.39 cm<sup>3</sup>\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, and 19\u00a0nm, respectively. The meso-CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> also showed a very high heat resistance, due to losing only 7.95% of its weight up to 800\u00a0\u00b0C, which is mainly related to the moisture loss. The optimal adsorption conditions were obtained based on response surface methods (RSM)-central composite design (CCD) techniques. The Langmuir isotherm model was used for fitting the adsorption measurements, which presented 587.5\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> as the maximum adsorption capacity of the dye. The data obtained from the adsorption kinetics model were found to correspond to the pseudo-second-order model. Also, the thermodynamic parameters including enthalpy change (\u0394H\u00b0), entropy change (\u0394S\u00b0), and Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G\u00b0) indicated that MG dye adsorption by the meso-CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was feasible, endothermic, and occurred spontaneously. Furthermore, the meso-CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was regenerated by microwave irradiation under 900\u00a0W at 6\u00a0min, and the MG dye removal efficiency was remained over 90%\u00a0after the\u00a0five cycles of microwave regeneration."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
