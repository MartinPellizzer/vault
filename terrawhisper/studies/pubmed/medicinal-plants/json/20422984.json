The content of heavy metal in spica met the requirement of the standard, and under the circumstances the content of ursolic acid was increased in a certain range. The critical values of Pb, Cu, Cd in the P. vulgaris grown soil were set at 450, 100, 1.0 mg x kg(-1), respectively.", "The harmful influence of the heavy metal stress at a lower concentration is lighter than at a higher concentration, and it could increase the content of ursolic acid.
