To expand scope of the research topic,ITS2 sequences of related species were downloaded from Gen Bank. Sequences assembly and consensus sequence generation were performed by ITS2 Database. The related data analysis and processing was performed using software MEGA 5. 10 and the NJ tree was constructed. The ITS2 secondary structure was predicted using ITS2 web server, and the differences of the ITS2 secondary structures of the samples were analyzed.", "Oxytropis medicinal materials ITS2 sequence was shorter, with sequence length of 216 ~ 218 bp, which was in favor of DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing. Genetic distances of Oxytropis myriophylla, Oxytropis fetissovii and Oxytropis grandiflora were much larger than the genetic distances of themselves. In the NJ tree, Oxytropis medicinal materials and counterfeits could be distinguished, and Oxytropis medicinal materials could be distinguished from Astragalus membranaceus.", "The DNA barcode based on ITS2 sequence is a powerful and efficient tool for identification of Oxytropis medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Si-you", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ya-nan", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Quan-jun", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Ting-guo", "Initials": "TG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxytropis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30080350"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
