With their increasing popularity, a new set of circumstances has arisen--the herb-drug interaction. In an effort to streamline the interaction information available, the author has designed two charts. The first lists the 21 most popular herbal medicines sold in Australia, sourced from the largest natural supplement manufacturer in Australia, Bullivant Natural Health Products. The second lists the 12 commonly prescribed prescription drug classes. This list was sourced from F H Faulding & Co Ltd, together with Australian Prescriber. Specific interaction information was collated from a variety of sources--medical and complementary medicine journals, pharmacy practice journals and respected phytotherapy texts. These tables are excerpts from these charts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Braun", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust Fam Physician", "NlmUniqueID": "0326701", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8495"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11458588"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
