Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell morphology was observed by a light microscope after HE staining. The protein expression of cell cycle components (cyclinE, CDK2, p21WAF1) were examined by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. The mRNA expression were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR.", "GS-Rh2 inhibited the proliferation of Eca-109 cells in dose and time-dependent manners. The inhibition rate was about 50% after 1-day treatment with 20 microg x mL(-1) GS-Rh2 x 20 microg x mL(-1) GS-Rh2 induced the mature differentiation and morphological reversion. With increasing dose of GS-Rh2 treatment, the cell number of G0/G1 phase was increased, whereas it decreased at S and G2/M phase. There was significant difference between 10, 20 microg x mL(-1) GS-Rh2 groups and the corresponding group without GS-Rh2 treatement. After treating cells by 20 microg x mL(-1) GS-Rh2 for 1, 2, 3 days individually, the protein and mRNA expression of both cyclinE and CDK2 reduced, while the expression of p21WAF1 enhanced gradually.", "GS-Rh2 could arrest Eca-109 cells at G0/G1 phase and induce cell differentiation tending to normal. Furthermore, GS-Rh2 had an effect on expression of cell cycle components (cyclinE, CDK2 and p21WAF1) to inhibit Eca-109 cell proliferation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang 050017, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Feng-ying", "Initials": "FY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun-ru", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Lian-fu", "Initials": "LF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CDKN1A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "78214-33-2", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rh2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "CDK2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16422547"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
