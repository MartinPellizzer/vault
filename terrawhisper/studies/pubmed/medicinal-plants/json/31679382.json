This study aims to identify all types of medicinal plants and synthetic medicines used by pregnant women in Kerman and to study factors related to their use.", "In this cross-sectional study, 150 women who had received prenatal care at 12 health centers in Kerman in 2017 were interviewed. Chi-square, t test and logistic regression were applied to investigate factors such as age, gestational age, mother's education, mother's occupation, perception of safety related to the use of medicinal plants and synthetic medicine during pregnancy.", "In this study, the rate of taking medicinal plants was 71.3% in pregnant women. The most common used medicinal plants and synthetic medicines were mint water (30%) and vitamins (47.3%), respectively. The most important mentioned reason for taking these medicinal plants during pregnancy was digestive problems. 52% of people believed that medicinal plants don't have any side effects. The chance of taking medicinal plants in housewives was 4.4 times more than employed women. Thinking that these medicines are safe to use increased the possibility of taking medicinal plants and synthetic medicines 4.5 and 3.1 times, respectively.", "Due to the potential side effects of medicinal plants, development and implementation of training programs to increase pregnant women's knowledge and a plan for specialized training for midwives and physicians employed in health centers seems necessary."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).
