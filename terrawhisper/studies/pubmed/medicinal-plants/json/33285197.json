Each product was tested as a pre-emergence herbicide against amaranth and tomato. The evaluations also involved determining the stability, morphology, encapsulation efficiency and release properties of the prepared formulations. Coating the savory EO with cross-linked biopolymers enhanced its stability and herbicidal activity, compared to the EO nano-emulsion without any polymer or cross-linker. Among the tested formulations, the strongest inhibitory effect against amaranth germination and growth was caused by Arabic gum-gelatin and apple pectin biopolymers at the concentration of 3\u00a0ml/L of EO, when cross-linked with citric acid. These two treatments had slight effects on tomato seedlings, however. The suppressive ability of the formulations was almost similar and comparable to the chemical herbicide metribuzin (1.75\u00a0g/L). In conclusion, Arabic gum-gelatin and apple pectin cross-linked by citric acid containing savory EO can be considered as potential, green and safe replacements for metribuzin in organic tomato production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
