Applied metals reduced dry mass content and concentration of nuclei in meristematic and differentiation zones. Chromium only enhanced nuclear mass concentration in the differentiation zone. The metals also made dry mass content and concentration of cytoplasm reduce, but they diminished mostly the concentration of cytoplasm in the meristematic zone and its dry mass in differentiation zone. Stimulation of cytoplasmic dry mass concentration was visible in the 1st mm (Cr) and 7th mm (Cd). Moreover, chromium caused a marked increase of cytoplasmic dry mass content in the 3rd mm of root. The studied metals reduced nuclear size, calculated as surface area, in the meristematic and differentiation zones. The increment of nuclear dimensions was observed only in the 1-3rd mm (Pb), 3rd (Cr) and 7th mm (Cd). In the presence of the applied metals the surface area of cytoplasm increased only in the 3rd mm and in 5th mm (chromium only). The present observations have shown that the toxicity of studied metals is as follows; Cd greater than Pb greater than Cr (nucleus - dry mass content and concentration, cytoplasmic area), Pb greater than Cd greater than Cr (cytoplasmic dry mass content and concentration and Cd greater than Cr greater than Pb (nuclear dimensions)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cytology and Embriology, Gda\u0144sk University, Poland."}], "LastName": "Romaniuk", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabara", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Folia Histochem Cytobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8502651", "ISSNLinking": "0239-8508"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3220148"]}}]}
