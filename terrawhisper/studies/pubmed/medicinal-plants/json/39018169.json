In the absence of specific therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), phytocompounds generated from plant extracts may be a promising strategy worth further investigation, motivating researchers to evaluate the safety and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effectiveness of these ingredients.", "To review phytochemicals in silico for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and to assess their safety and effectiveness in vitro and in vivo.", "The present review was conducted using various scientific databases and studies on anti-SARS-CoV-2 phytochemicals were analyzed and summarized. The results obtained from the in silico screening were subjected to extraction, isolation, and purification. The in vitro studies on anti-SarcoV-2 were also included in this review. In addition, the results of this research were interpreted, analyzed, and documented on the basis of the bibliographic information obtained.", "This review discusses recent research on using natural remedies to cure or prevent COVID-19 infection. The literature analysis shows that the various herbal preparations (extracts) and purified compounds can block the replication or entrance of the virus directly to carry out their anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. It is interesting to note that certain items can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting human cells by blocking the ACE-2 receptor or the serine protease TMPRRS2. Moreover, natural substances have been demonstrated to block proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, such as papain- or chymotrypsin-like proteases.", "The natural products may have the potential for use singly or in combination as alternative drugs to treat/prevent COVID-19 infection, including blocking or stimulating ACE-2. In addition, their structures may provide indications for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
