Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the T-lymphocyte receptor for antigen (Ti) and/or its associated structure, CD3, activate T cells. More recently, a second pathway of activation has been described which involves the sheep erythrocyte binding glycoprotein CD2, a surface molecule distinct from Ti-CD3. Lysates from surface-iodinated T-leukaemia cell lines were treated with lectin and affinity purified anti-lectin antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose. We have shown that eluates from Con A/anti-Con A or PHA/anti-PHA immunoprecipitates contained Ti, since a rabbit anti-T alpha serum, which recognizes the native and denatured forms of the constant region of the alpha chain, immunoprecipitated Ti from these eluates. Furthermore, Ti immunoprecipitated by anti-T alpha serum from lysates of surface iodinated E+ lymphocytes was binding to PHA after elution from the immunoprecipitate. When the purified Ti molecule was reduced and alkylated, allowing the permanent dissociation of its alpha and beta subunits, PHA interacted with both chains, whereas anti-T alpha serum immunoprecipitated the alpha chain only. Altogether, these results demonstrate that PHA interacts with both chains of the T cell receptor for antigen on human peripheral T lymphocytes. With the HPB-ALL tumour line, a similar approach showed that both alpha and beta chains of Ti bind to Con A and Ulex europaeus 1 but not Helix pomatia. Affinity chromatography on immobilized lectins and immunoprecipitation with lectin/anti-lectin antibodies were employed to test whether CD2 binds to PHA and Con A. The results show that CD2 from human peripheral T lymphocytes binds both lectins but with a lower affinity for PHA than Con A."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leca", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boumsell", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fabbi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reinherz", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kanellopoulos", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0323767", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Precipitation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3085210", "10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb01985.x"]}}]}
