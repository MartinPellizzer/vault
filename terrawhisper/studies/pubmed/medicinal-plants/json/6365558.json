In GA without added 2,4-D, the cells stopped dividing and continued elongating for several days. Total growth was the same in both hormone conditions. An immunofluorescent technique was developed to study microtubule (MT) distribution. Cells in GA showed parallel MT arrays oriented transversely to the axis of elongation. In some cells the number of MT per unit length was maintained during growth while other elongating cells showed reduced frequency of MT. Microtubules often appeared as thickened, branched strands, probably as a result of lateral aggregation. In cells grown in 2,4-D some pre-prophase bands of MT were observed. Cells in mitosis lacked cortical MT, and all organized staining was in spindles or phragmoplasts. Interphase cells in 2,4-D showed variable organization of cortical MT ranging from disordered to transversely ordered. Cells in early interphase had disordered MT while larger cells showed order. These observations indicate that MT in cycling cells are continually changing organization, probably accounting for the different distributions observed in interphase cells. On cessation of the mitotic cycle, reorganization of MT stops and transverse arrays of cortical MT are maintained as cells elongate. These processes are similar to those observed in organized tissues; however, cultured cells offer distinct advantages for experimental manipulation and microscopic observation of cytoskeleton."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Simmonds", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Setterfield", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "7906240", "ISSNLinking": "0171-9335"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Antibody Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Microtubules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6365558"]}}]}
