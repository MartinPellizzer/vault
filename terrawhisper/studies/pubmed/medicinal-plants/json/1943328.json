The physiology of the male reproductive system is presented as an introduction: an ideal male antifertility agent would inhibit spermatogenesis at the level of the Sertoli cells, without affecting endogenous androgen production by Leydig cells, needed for libido and potency. Androgens down-regulate their own production at physiological levels, but few long-acting orally active derivatives are available. Anti-androgens with mixed androgen and progestin activity, combined with a pure androgen are potentially useful. Androgen-progestin combinations are being tested by WHO as implants. Dozens of miscellaneous nonsteroidal compounds have been discovered serendipitously to have antifertility activity in men or male animals, including alkylating agents antimetabolites, antibiotics, sulfa derivatives, fungicides, trichomonocides, amebicides, alpha blockers, antimalarials, coumarins, and carbohydrate derivatives. Various plant alkaloids have been screened. Those of Hibiscus, Vitex and Plumbago species, as well as Tripterygium wilfordii glycosides, which are being evaluated in combination with gossypol, are mentioned here. Gossypol has been thoroughly tested in China, but rejected because of its side effects, particularly hypokalemic paralysis, its low therapeutic index, and uncertain recovery of fertility. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonists are being researched in combination with androgens with some success. The GnRH antagonists to date have low activity , or cause histamine-related side effects at higher doses; the androgens require a new route such as a long-acting implant to overcome the need for daily injections. Immunological contraception for males has not progressed beyond the research stage."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["070347", "00208168"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Aggression", "Alkaloids", "Androgens", "Animals, Laboratory", "Asia", "Behavior", "Biology", "Chemosterilants", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraception, Immunological", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Contraceptive Agents, Progestin", "Contraceptive Implants", "Contraceptive Methods", "Decreased Libido", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Endocrine System", "Estrogens", "Family Planning", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Male", "Germ Cells", "Gonadotropins", "Gossypol", "Health", "Health Services", "Hemic System", "Hormones", "Human Volunteers", "India", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Injectables", "Literature Review", "Male Contraception", "Medicine", "Mustard Compounds", "Organic Chemicals", "Physiology", "Pituitary Hormone Releasing Hormones", "Plants, Medicinal", "Potassium Ion Level", "Progestational Hormones", "Research Methodology", "Reversibility", "Sex Behavior", "Southern Asia", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermatogenesis Blocking Agents", "Spermatozoa", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Sterilization, Sexual", "Testosterone", "Urogenital System"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "1943328", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "02"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "28"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0198-6325", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "11", "Issue": "5", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Medicinal research reviews", "ISOAbbreviation": "Med Res Rev"}, "ArticleTitle": "Development of male-fertility-regulating agents.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "437", "EndPage": "472", "MedlinePgn": "437-72"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Division, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Ray", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Res Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8103150", "ISSNLinking": "0198-6325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaccines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57285-09-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Inhibins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Inhibins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vaccines"}], "NumberOfReferences": "190"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1943328", "10.1002/med.2610110502"]}}]}
