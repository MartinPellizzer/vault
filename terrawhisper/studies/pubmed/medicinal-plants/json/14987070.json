Today, many research groups are exploring the biodiversity of the plant kingdom to find new and better anti-HIV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. In this review, plant substances showing a promising anti-HIV activity are discussed according to the viral targets with which they interact. Most of these compounds, however, interfere with early steps in the HIV replication, such as the virus entry steps and the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase, whereas until now almost no plant compounds have been found to interact with the many other viral targets. Since some plant substances are known to modulate several cellular factors, such as NF-kappa B and TNF-alpha, which are also involved in the replication of HIV, their role as potential anti-HIV products is also discussed. In conclusion, several plant-derived antiviral agents are good candidates to be further studied for their potential in the systemic therapy and/or prophylaxis of HIV infections, most probably in combination with other anti-HIV drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, University of Antwerp, Universiteitsplein 1, B-2610 Antwerp, Belgium. arnold.vlietinck@ua.ac.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cos", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maes", "ForeName": "Louis", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vanden Berghe", "ForeName": "Dirk", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hermans", "ForeName": "Nina", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pieters", "ForeName": "Luc", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vlietinck", "ForeName": "Arnold", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Integrase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.49", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Integrase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Reverse Transcriptase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Integration"}], "NumberOfReferences": "132"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14987070", "10.1021/np034016p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
