Meyer) were analyzed for their free amino acid contents. The neuro-excitatory beta-ODAP (beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid), suggested to be the cause of the crippling neurolathyrism, was the major component in the seed extract (70% of the total free amino acids detected) and showed the highest concentration (0.43% by wt) compared to that in the different parts of young plants. beta-ODAP concentration was higher in the shoots as compared to roots and declined in older plants. The amount of beta-ODAP in the roots may be considered as an indirect measure of age and quality. Another neuro-active non-protein amino acid, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), increased dramatically after germination and reached highest concentration in different parts of 3 year-old plants. Glutamine and arginine were the two major free proteinogenic amino acids in the ginseng plants and together they constituted over 50% of all the free amino acids detected in the root."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Jozef Kluyskensstraat 27, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Yu-Haey", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikegami", "ForeName": "Fumio", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lambein", "ForeName": "Fernand", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1TG777QI25", "NameOfSubstance": "oxalyldiaminopropionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56-12-2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12591261", "10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00658-1", "S0031942202006581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
