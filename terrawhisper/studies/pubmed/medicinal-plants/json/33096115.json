The speed of the disease progression depends on the patient's lifestyle. Due to life stresses and lack of time, a high number of people depend on fast food containing a high amount of fats which one of the main causes of insulin resistance (IR). IR is one of the metabolic disorders which strongly intersected with molecular NAFLD and leading to its progression into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this review, we introduced the updated statistics of NAFLD and NASH progression all over the world shows its importance, etiologies, and pathogenesis. Also, IR and its role in NASH initiation and progression explored, and current treatments with its limitations have been explained. Glucosinolates (GLS) is a group of phytochemicals which known by its potent hydrolysis products with promising anti-cancer effect. In this review, we have collected the recent experimental studies of different GLS hydrolysis products against IR and chronic liver diseases supported by our lab finding. Finally, we recommend this group of phytochemicals as promising molecules to be studied experimentally and clinically against a wide range of chronic liver diseases with an acceptable safety margin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
