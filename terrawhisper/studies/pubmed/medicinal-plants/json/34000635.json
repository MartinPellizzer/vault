To develop a cost-effective and rapid tool for carbohydrate profiling, applicability of attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy of onion juice was investigated with special regard to FOS patterns. As reference, detailed carbohydrate profiles of onion juices were generated by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of ATR-FTIR spectra was successfully applied for classifying onions into fresh market, storage and dehydrator type according to HPLC-ELSD profiles. A bootstrapping method for automatized test-set validation by projection to latent structures (PLS) algorithms using HPLC and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy data was developed. Model statistics showed promising perspectives for reliable quantification of individual saccharides and sum parameters. The presented methodology allows estimating the nutritional and pre-biotic value directly during cultivation and processing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
