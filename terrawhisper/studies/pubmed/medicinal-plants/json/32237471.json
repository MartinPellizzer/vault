Sichuan is one of the proviences most rich in Chinese herb resources,which has 7 290 species of Chinese herbs, such as Curcumae Longae Rhizoma, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata, Ophiopogonis Radix, Coptidis Rhizoma, Gentianae Radix, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Curcumae Rhizoma, Gardeniae Fructus, ect. After textual research on materia medica of the 7 290 Chinese herbs, we find there are 86 Dao-di herbs in Sichuan, such as Chuanxiong Rhizoma from Dujiangyan, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata from Jiangyou, Fritillariae Radix, Notoptergii Rhizoma et Radix, Angelicae Dahuricae Radix from Suining, Ophiopogonis Radix from Santai, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma from Zhongjiang, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex from Pingwu. In China more attention is paid to the production of Dao-di herbs. In 2018, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine launched the \"Construction Plan of national production base of genuine medicinal materials\". Developing genuine medicinal materials in genuine production areas is one of the effective ways to ensure the quality of medicinal materials. Based on the study of geographical environment and ecological factors(altitude, climate, soil) in Sichuan province. The Dao-di herbs of Sichuan province are divided into 4 districts, including, Sichuan basin medicinal materials production area, mountain and the basin edge medicinal materials production area, Panxi medicinal materials production area, Plateau Mountain Canyon medicinal materials production area. The suitable regions and best suitable regions of the 86 Dao-di herbs in Sichuan are determined by remote sensing and GIS spatial analysis of the suitable environmental indicators of these Dao-di herbs. Our study is beneficial to the rational distribution of the production and to improvement of the quality of traditional Chinese medicine in Sichuan province."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Qing-Mao", "Initials": "QM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Normal University Chengdu 637002, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Wen-Fu", "Initials": "WF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jun-Ning", "Initials": "JN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Su", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Biological Assay Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "Lin-Ying", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Medical College Chengdu 610500, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jing-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237471", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200104.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
