The most effective known antiaging intervention consists of calorie restriction (CR), which increases lifespan in yeasts, worms, fruit flies, mice, and nonhuman primates. CR also improves healthspan by preventing the development of various aging-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Many compounds isolated from plants and fungi prolong lifespan and prevent age-related diseases in model organisms. These plant and fungal compounds modulate the same cellular and physiological pathways as CR, including those involving insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, mammalian target of rapamycin, and sirtuins. Modulation of these aging-related pathways results in the activation of various cellular processes such as autophagy, DNA repair, and neutralization of reactive oxygen species. Together, these cellular processes are believed to delay aging and prevent chronic diseases by improving bodily functions and stress resistance. We review here the mechanisms of action of plant and fungal molecules possessing antiaging properties and discuss the possibilities and challenges associated with the development of antiaging compounds isolated from natural products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0879-109X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Martel", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1461-4495"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of the Pacific, Arthur Dugoni School of Dentistry, San Francisco, California."}], "LastName": "Ojcius", "ForeName": "David M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Biotechnology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Research Center, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Yun-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Science, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Bacterial Pathogenesis, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Chih-Jung", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5516-4200"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Immunology Consortium, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chang Gung Biotechnology Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemical Engineering Research Center, Ming Chi University of Technology, New Taipei City, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "John D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Res Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8103150", "ISSNLinking": "0198-6325"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autophagy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caloric Restriction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30648267", "10.1002/med.21559"]}}]}
