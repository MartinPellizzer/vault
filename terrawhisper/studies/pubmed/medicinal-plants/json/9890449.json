At a recent workshop in Kuala Lumpur it was recommended that \"quid\" be defined as \"a substance, or mixture of substances, placed in the mouth or chewed and remaining in contact with the mucosa, usually containing one or both of the two basic ingredients, tobacco and/or areca nut, in raw or any manufactured or processed form.\" Clear delineations on contents of the quid (areca nut quid, tobacco quid, and tobacco and areca nut quid) are recommended as absolute criteria with finer subdivisions to be added if necessary. The betel quid refers to any quid wrapped in betel leaf and is therefore a specific variety of quid. The workshop proposed that quid-related lesions should be categorized conceptually into two categories: first, those that are diffusely outlined and second, those localized at the site where a quid is regularly placed. Additional or expanded criteria and guidelines were proposed to define, describe or identify lesions such as chewer's mucosa, areca nut chewer's lesion, oral submucous fibrosis and other quid-related lesions. A new clinical entity, betel-quid lichenoid lesion, was also proposed to describe an oral lichen planus-like lesion associated with the betel quid habit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Pathology, Oral Medicine and Periodontology, University of Malaya, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Zain", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Warnakulasuriya", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Wyk", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shrestha", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ax\u00e9ll", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Consensus Development Conference", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lichen Planus, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lichenoid Eruptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}], "NumberOfReferences": "15"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9890449", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1999.tb01985.x"]}}]}
