The content of 6-keto-PGF1alpha in the DRE group was higher than that in the groups of LE, GE, AE, ALE, AGE. The ratio of 6-keto-PGF1alpha/TXB2 in the DRE group was higher than that of the groups of GE, AE, ALE. Compared with the control group, DRE, LE, GE, AE, ALE, AGE increased significantly the content of NO2- in culture medium of rat vascular endothelial cells under hypoxia. Moreover, the content of NO2- in the DRE group was higher than that of the groups of GE, AE, ALE.", "The results suggested that DRE increased significantly the content of PGI2 and the ratio of PGI2/TXA2 as well as the content of NO. The effect of DRE on the parameters in culture medium of rat vascular endothelial cells under hypoxia was better than that of the extracts from its component herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Dalian, Dalian 116013, China. ddbc@mail.dlptt.ln.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Ying-chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Tian-shu", "Initials": "TS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Hui-jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ya-juan", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Dong-ming", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sini tang"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54397-85-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Thromboxane B2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "58962-34-8", "NameOfSubstance": "6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Abdominal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thromboxane B2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15631091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
