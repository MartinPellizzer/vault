In this study, we combined photoorgano redox catalysis and P450 biocatalysts to obtain dioxygen-functionalization of \u03b1/\u03b2-C-H bonds of arylalkanes in a straightforward manner. The synthesis of enantiomerically chiral acyloins through a one-pot two-step photoredox/P450-catalyzed cascade reaction is described. Two P450 mutants with stereocomplementary bio-oxidation were obtained using mutagenesis technology and were able to asymmetrically hydroxylate ketones to acyloins with excellent ee values, which were further proved to be efficient on a wide range of substrates. Moreover, a photoredox synthesis of ketones <i>in situ</i> was developed by the direct carbonylation of aromatic methyl C-H bonds and subsequently combined with the aerobic P450-biocatalytic enantioselective hydroxylation of intermediate ketones, thus providing a green and sustainable approach towards optically pure acyloins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
