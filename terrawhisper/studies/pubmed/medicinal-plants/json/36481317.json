(Asteraceae). Three undescribed davanone-related terpenoids, arteperoxides A-C, were isolated from the extract with two known derivatives, hydroxydavanone and davana acid. Structural analysis revealed that arteperoxides A-C were tris-normonoterpene-sesquiterpene conjugates with peroxide bridges. Although davanone derivatives with peroxides, such as a hydroperoxyl and peroxyhemiketal groups, have been isolated from Artemisia species, arteperoxides A-C are the first variations observed to contain peroxide bridges between two terpene-derived units. The absolute configurations of arteperoxides A and B were studied based on their spectroscopic data compared with those of the semisynthetic analogs that have ether linkages. The natural and synthetic compounds were tested for the antiosteoclastogenic activity, and arteperoxide C and hydroxydavanone were more potent than other compounds at 20\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
