Very few females (1.6%) were found to be alcohol users and they were excluded from further analysis. Among 7604 males, 30.4% used alcohol regularly, 25.4% occasionally and 44.2% were non-users. The prevalence of leukoplakia was significantly higher among regular (5.7%) and occasional (3.9%) users than among non-users (2.9%) of alcohol. Alcohol usage was found to be related to age as well as tobacco habits. The prevalence of leukoplakia was higher among alcohol users in each age-group as well as in each tobacco habit category. After age-adjustment the difference between alcohol users and non-users, although reduced, remained significant. For most tobacco habit categories the trend remained similar after age-adjustment except for the mixed habits group, for which there was a reversal of the trend. The alcohol habit may, perhaps, produce discernible effects only in association with other 'weak' etiological risk factors, such as a single tobacco habit of smoking or chewing rather than a 'strong' etiologic factor such as the mixed habits of chewing and smoking."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1-022-N", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Oral Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410263", "ISSNLinking": "0301-5661"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukoplakia, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6583042", "10.1111/j.1600-0528.1984.tb01409.x"]}}]}
