Crude extract along with individual components, including flavone-glycosides and biflavones, were applied to cultured normal human skin fibroblasts for 12 hours, and 0, 20, 40 and 80 mJ/cm2 of UVB were irradiated. Two synthetic flavonoids, quercetin and rutin, which have polyphenol structures close to the flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba extract, were used to compare any structure-related activity under the same conditions. At the concentrations (from 0.25 to 2 mg/ml) treated with biflavone components (isoginkgetin/ginkgetin, sciadopitysin) and quercetin, high neutral red dye uptake was detected with gradual increases in UVB irradiation. The time-course release of LDH was determined as the cytotoxicity index (%) during 24 hours following a high dose UVB irradiation (200 mJ/cm2), and the pattern of this cytotoxicity index was similar to that of the neutral red dye uptake results. Sciadopitysin, isoginkgetin/ginkgetin and quercetin treatments lowered cytotoxicity indices to 50.81, 67.81 and 62.19%, respectively, compared to 95.38% for the untreated control. The antioxidant potential of biflavones of Ginkgo biloba could be explained on the basis of structure-related activity; hydroxy- and methyl-substitutions on the basic structure of these flavonoids played a role, as other reports have suggested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Kwangju 501-757, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "7600545", "ISSNLinking": "0385-2407"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "261QK3SSBH", "NameOfSubstance": "Neutral Red"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutral Red"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11449670", "10.1111/j.1346-8138.2001.tb00117.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
