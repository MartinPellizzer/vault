Baicalein, wogonin and their glycosides baicalin and wogonoside are major active components found in medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis. These flavones can induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, with such pharmacological activities as anti-oxidation, antivirus and liver protection. In recent years, the biosynthesis pathways of flavones in Scutellaria have been studied thoroughly. In particular, the biosynthesis pathways of baicalein and wogonin in S. baicalensis were interpreted completely. In this review, the biosynthesis of flavones in Scutellaria, the regulation of environmental factors and elicitors on their biosynthesis, and the metabolic engineering of the flavones were discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Yu-Min", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Meng-Ying", "ForeName": "Cui", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Jie", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Tian-Lin", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Yu-Kun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Resources, Shanghai Chenshan Botanical Garden,Shanghai Chenshan Plant Science Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai 201602, China."}], "LastName": "Qing", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350252", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200709.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
