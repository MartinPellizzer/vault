Currently, several drugs are in use to treat cancer but such drugs show negative side effects on normal cells and cause severe toxicity.", "The current research is mainly focused on medicinal plants with potential therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cancer without any adverse effects on normal cells. In this regard, garlic and its active compounds including diallyl sulfide, diallyl trisulfide, ajoene, and allicin have been established to suppress the growth of cancer and killing of cancer cells.", "The review focuses on garlic and its active compounds chemopreventive effect through modulating various cell signalling pathways.
