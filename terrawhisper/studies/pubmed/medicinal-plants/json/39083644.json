Imidacloprid was the most detected NEO (88.24% of samples), ranging from 1.50 to 2850 \u03bcg/kg. To the best of our knowledge, some novel NEOs were detected in <i>P. notoginseng</i> for the first time. NEO clustering patterns varied among plant parts, with higher contamination in leaves and flowers. Fourteen NEO/m-NEOs, including cycloxaprid and acetamiprid, showed site-specific behavior, indicating the possibility of using multiple NEOs simultaneously during planting, resulting in formation of distinct metabolites in different plant parts. Transfer rates in decoction and infusion ranged from 10.06 to 32.33%, reducing residues postprocessing. Dietary risk assessment showed low hazard quotients (HQ<sub>a</sub>: 7.05 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup> to 2.09 \u00d7 10<sup>-2</sup>; HQ<sub>c</sub>: 3.74 \u00d7 10<sup>-7</sup> to 2.38 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup>), but risk-ranking scores indicated potential hazards with imidacloprid and acetamiprid in flowers and leaves. The findings are expected to promote safety assessment and distribution research of NEOs in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yudan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zuliang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xueli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yunyun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education & Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jiaoyang", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7762-6691"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Quality Ensurance and Sustainable Use of Dao-di Herbs, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Haikou 570311, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Meihua", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39083644", "10.1021/acs.jafc.4c02561"]}}]}
