Colon cancer death rates have risen worldwide due to the current food habit and lifestyle, which include a lot of meat, alcohol, and not enough physical exercise. As a result, novel, less harmful pharmacological treatments for colon cancer are needed now more than ever before. Colorectal cancer (CRC) affects a significant portion of the world's population. Chemotherapy's limits, as demonstrated by side effects and resistance in CRC patients, are now being sought after despite recent breakthroughs that have improved patient care and survival. Numerous chemical compounds present in medicinal herbs have shown anti-tumor and anti-apoptotic properties against various cancers, including CRC, in animal experiments. These chemicals, which come from several phytochemical families, activate several signaling pathways. This article discusses research on the anti-CRC benefits of many plants conducted in vitro, as well as the phytochemical components of plants that may play a role in the study. Researchers are also looking into the impact of these compounds on various pathways involved in cancer signaling. According to this review, anti-CRC compounds may be generated from medicinal plants. That's why we're looking at how natural items can help treat cancer while lowering the risk of developing it."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
