This study was oriented to evaluate the protective and curative capacity of garlic, ginger and mirazid in comparison with metronidazole drug (commercially known) against Cryptosporidium in experimental mice. Male Swiss Albino mice experimentally infected with C. parvum were treated with medicinal plants extracts (Ginger, Mirazid, and Garlic) as compared to chemical drug Metronidazole. Importantly, C. parvum-infected mice treated with ginger, Mirazid, garlic and metronidazole showed a complete elimination in shedding oocysts by 9th day PI. The reduction and elimination of shedding oocysts in response to the treatments might be attributable to a direct effect on parasite growth in intestines, sexual phases production and/or the formation of oocysts. The results were evaluated histopathological examination of ideum section of control mice (uninfected, untreated) displayed normal architecture of the villi. Examiination of infected mice ileum section (infected, untreated) displayed histopathological alterations from uninfected groups. Examination of ileum section prepared from mice treated with garlic, ginger, mirazid, and metronidazole displayed histopathological alterations from that of the control groups, and showed marked histologic correction in the pattern with the four regimes used in comparison to control mice. Garlic successfully eradicated oocysts of infected mice from stool and intestine. Supplementation of ginger to infected mice markedly corrected elevation in the inflammatory risk factors and implied its potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory capabilities. Infected mice treated with ginger, mirazid, garlic and metronidazole showed significant symptomatic improvements during treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abouel-Nour", "ForeName": "Mohamed F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Shewehy", "ForeName": "Dina Magdy M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamada", "ForeName": "Shadia F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morsy", "ForeName": "Tosson A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Egypt", "MedlineTA": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol", "NlmUniqueID": "8102141", "ISSNLinking": "1110-0583"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140QMO216E", "NameOfSubstance": "Metronidazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-45-7", "NameOfSubstance": "myrrh resin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commiphora"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium parvum"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Metronidazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27363055", "10.12816/0026164"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
