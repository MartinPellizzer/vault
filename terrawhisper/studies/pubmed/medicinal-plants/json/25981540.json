This study aims to seek identification and characterization of flavonoid C- and O-glycosides in the aqueous fraction of the plant leaves.", "A method was developed for simultaneous characterization of flavonoids and their glycosides using high-pressure liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS/MS). The chromatographic separation was carried on an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (4.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009150 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m) operated with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution and methanol as the mobile phase.", "The fragmentations of the studied [M-H](-) ions of C-glycosides were shown to be cross-ring cleavages of the glycoside moiety [M-H-(60/90/120)](-) whereas O-glycosides were shown to eliminate the sugar moiety (Y0 (-) or [Y0 -H](-) ) from the aglycone unit; 6-C-glycosides exhibited [M-H-18](-) , a characteristic ion, and also a higher abundance of (0,3) X6 or 8 ions in comparison to 8-C glycosides; flavonoid 6,8-di-C-glycosides exhibited cross-ring cleavages of the sugar attached to the C-6 position preferentially.", "This method was successfully applied for analysis of flavonoids and their glycosides in Adhatoda vasica leaves.
