The present study was designed to uncover the effects of zeaxanthin dipalmitate on hepatic parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells in vitro. Uptake of [3H]thymidine by cultured rat Ito cells in response to zeaxanthin dipalmitate was measured. Collagen synthesis was assessed by the collagenase digestion method. The effects of zeaxanthin dipalmitate on the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from Kupffer cells and peritoneal macrophages were also assayed. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate showed a significant hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride toxicity. Cellular malondialdehyde (MDA) levels declined significantly with the treatment of the compound in a concentration dependent manner. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate significantly inhibited the uptake of [3H]thymidine by Ito cells. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate also reduced collagen synthesis in Ito cells by 65.1% (p < 0.05) as compared to untreated controls. The formation of NO in either Kupffer cells or in peritoneal macrophages was significantly decreased by zeaxanthin dipalmitate in a concentration dependent manner. The release of TNF-alpha was somewhat less affected by the compound. From these results, we conclude that zeaxanthin dipalmitate exerts a potent hepatoprotective activity by inhibiting Ito cell proliferation, collagen synthesis and by inhibiting certain biochemical functions of Kupffer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9437512", "ISSNLinking": "1078-0297"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Palmitates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthophylls"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "570944I2YB", "NameOfSubstance": "zeaxanthin dipalmitate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kupffer Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Palmitates"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xanthophylls"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9387190"]}}]}
