All patients were prospectively studied. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to radiologic progression (TTP).", "The TACE + KA group had significantly longer median OS (27.0 vs 21.0 months, P = .038) and TTP (12.0 vs 10.0 months, P = .028) than TACE group.

TACE + KA group displayed significantly lower incidences of intrahepatic and extrahepatic metastases, as well as postembolization syndrome than TACE group ( P < .05).
