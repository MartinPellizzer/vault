On Oct. 23 and Sept. 25, 3 leaves per cultivar were collected on different plants, and 80 mg mesophyll was collected among upper lateral veins and was ground in 96% alcohol, and the supernatant was subjected to measure on a spectrophotometer (Angilent 8453).", "The PPCs among cultivars were significantly different at a P < or = 0.01 level. The results of the measurements were similar. Chlolophyll a was the most abundant pigment, but varied to a great extent among different cultivars. 20 cultivars were divided into 9 homogeneous groups according to the contents of chlorophyll a by Duncan's multiple range test at P < or = 0.05. In addition, the content of chlorophyll a was closely related to leaf color. The cultivars with higher chlolophyll a had deep green leaves, and those with lower had yellow green or pale green leaves.", "PPC was an inherent character and an important index for the germplasm evaluation of R. glutinosa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, Shandong, China. x.s.wen@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Xue-sen", "Initials": "XS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Hong-xiang", "Initials": "HX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shi-lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xian-en", "Initials": "XE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Xiu-min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li-zhen", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jun-hua", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12776585"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
