In-depth chemome comparisons of Cistanche plants, such as C. deserticola, C. salsa, C. tubulosa, and C. sinensis, that possess dramatic economic and ecological benefits for the arid regions in the northwest China attributing to their dramatic medicinal and edible values, were employed to verify the applicability. <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based non-targeted matabolomics acted as the survey experiment to find those signals offering decisive contributions towards the species discrimination, and the signals were translated to a set of putative identities, eighteen ones in total, through matching with authentic compounds and referring to some accessible databases. Afterwards, an advanced LC-MS platform assembling reversed phase liquid chromatography, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, and tailored multiple reaction monitoring, was introduced to simultaneously quantify those eighteen potential markers in a single analytical run, because those candidates exhibited great polarity span as well as wide content range. Significant species differences occurred amongst their chemome patterns. Echinacoside, acteoside, betaine, mannitol, 6-deoxycatalpol, sucrose, and 8-epi-loganic acid were disclosed as the markers enabling the discrimination of those four species. The findings offered an alternative tool to differentiate Cistanche plants. More importantly, the strategy namely \"from <sup>1</sup>H NMR-based non-targeted to LC-MS-based targeted metabolomics\" facilitates the pursuit of molecular markers among analogue plants, and thereby provides a promising choice for in-depth chemome comparison."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
