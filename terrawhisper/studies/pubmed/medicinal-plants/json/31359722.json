Comparative study of water characteristic components of G. uralensis from three geographical origins was conducted by PCA,OPLS-DA chemical pattern recognition combined with LC-TOF/MS and muti-component analysis. The similarity of fingerprints of 32 batches of medicinal materials ranged from 0. 903 to 0. 999. Patterns recognition could be used to distinguish cultivated G. uralensis in Gansu and Xinjiang areas from cultivated and wild plants in Inner Mongolia. Then a total of thirty-one common constituents were identified by LC-TOF/MS analysis coupled with standard compounds information. The contents of four flavonoid glycosides and five saponins were determinated by HPLC and compared using One-way ANOVA. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the contents of 5 triterpenoid saponins among the three regions,but the contents of 4 flavonoid saponins showed the trend of Inner Mongolia >Gansu\u2248Xinjiang( P<0. 05). In the same Inner Mongolia region,the contents of 4 flavonoid glycosides and 5 triterpenoid saponins in wild plant was significantly higher than that in cultivated plants( P<0. 01). In addition,the contents of liquiritin,isoliquiritin,licorice-saponin A_3,22\u03b2-acetoxyl-glycyrrhizic acid and uralsaponin B in Gansu and Xinjiang were obviously lower than those in Inner Mongolia,but the contents of glycyrrhizic acid,the main component of G. uralensis,were not different in the three geographical regions. In Inner Mongolia,the contents of liquiritin,isoliquiritin,licorice-saponin A_3,licorice-saponin G_2 and glycyrrhizic acid in wild plants were significantly higher than those in cultivated plants. In conclusion,qualitative/quantitative analysis of multi-index components combined with pattern recognition could effectively evaluate the quality of cultivated and wild licorice in different regions. It was helpful for us to understand the reality of licorice in different regions,and provided scientific basis for the development and comprehensive utilization of licorice resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yun-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Wei-Ping", "Initials": "WP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhi-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cun-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Li-Hong", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy,Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023,China Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization Nanjing 210023,China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Gou-Ping", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31359722", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190321.210"]}}]}
