However, the scientific basis for their use has not been well established. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effects of water extractable phytochemicals of H. umbellata and A. leiocarpus on phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) and arginase as well as pro-oxidants induced lipid peroxidation in rat penile tissue.", "The effects of the extracts on important enzymes (PDE-5 and arginase) linked with ED and pro-oxidants (Fe2+ and sodium nitroprusside) induced lipid peroxidation were investigated. Also, radicals scavenging and metal chelating abilities were determined. In addition, phenolic contents were determined and characterized using HPLC.", "The results showed that both extracts inhibited PDE-5 and arginase activities in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibitory property of A. leiocarpus (IC50 - 174.19 \u03bcg/mL) was significantly better (p<0.05) than that of H. umbellata (IC50 - 537.72 \u03bcg/mL) in PDE-5 assay. The extracts were potent inhibitors of arginase than PDE-5, and these extracts were equally potent in inhibiting arginase. Furthermore, Fe2+ and sodium nitroprusside caused a significant increase in malondialdehyde content; however, both extracts reduced malondialdehyde level in concentration-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that both extracts scavenged radicals (OH* and ABTS*) and chelated Fe2+. HPLC analysis revealed abundance of rutin, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and quercetin, among others.", "The ability of the extracts to inhibit PDE-5, arginase and pro-oxidant induced lipid peroxidation, and chelate metal might suggest their folkloric use for the management of ED."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Oboh", "ForeName": "Ganiyu", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Adebayo", "ForeName": "Adeniyi Abiodun", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Ademosun", "ForeName": "Ayokunle Olubode", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "."}], "LastName": "Boligon", "ForeName": "Aline August", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "169D1260KM", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroprusside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.4.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Arginase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Combretaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroprusside"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Penis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28306529", "10.1515/jbcpp-2016-0143", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2016-0143/jbcpp-2016-0143.xml"]}}]}
