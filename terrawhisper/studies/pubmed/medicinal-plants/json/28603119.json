Therefore, drug-drug interactions were examined between CMT and donepezil as a first screening of combination therapy for cognitive deficits. Rats received oral co-administration of donepezil with distilled water as a control or donepezil with CMT as a combination. The distilled water or CMT was co-administered at intervals within 5min after donepezil or 1.5h intervals. The plasma samples were analyzed for donepezil concentration and its pharmacokinetic parameters of T<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, AUC, t<sub>1/2</sub> and MRT<sub>inf</sub>. In the single co-administration at intervals within 5min, donepezil was detected lower in the combination than control at 0.5h and 2h post-treatment (P<0.05). In addition, the combination showed significant increases in MRT<sub>inf</sub> compared to the control (P<0.05). This suggests drug-drug interactions between donepezil and CMT in the co-administration within 5 min. However, no meaningful differences were found in the pharmacokinetic profiles of donepezil by single dosing with CMT at 1.5h intervals and even by the repeated dosing for a week at 1.5h intervals potential combination therapy of donepezil with CMT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Kyung-Min", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Catholic University of Daegu School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Oh-Dae", "Initials": "OD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Histology, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Soo-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Histology, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chang-Hyun", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Histology, College of Korean Medicine, Daegu Haany University, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ku", "ForeName": "Sae-Kwang", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "chong-myung-tang"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8SSC91326P", "NameOfSubstance": "Donepezil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Donepezil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Half-Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Indans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Korean Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Clearance Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28603119"]}}]}
