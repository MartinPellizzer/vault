Antiretroviral therapy involving chemical drugs has declined acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related mortality and improved the life quality of AIDS/HIV sufferers. However, the emergence of drug resistance and side effects are the main obstacles for the long-term use of these chemicals as antiretroviral therapy. Recently, a lot of emphasis is being put on finding naturally occurring drug candidates that show activity against HIV and can be potentially used as antiretroviral therapy. In this study, different medicinal plants, Pistacia khinjuk, Teucrium stocksianum, Uncaria tomentosa, Pistacia integerrima, Trigonella gharuensis, and Artocarpus lakoocha, were explored for their anti-HIV potential. Syncytium and p24 assays were performed to determine antiviral activity, while the MTT assay was used to determine cytotoxicity. Results showed that extracts from all six plants inhibited HIV replication in vitro. Also, extracts from Pistacia\u00a0khinjuk, Teucrium stocksianum, Uncaria tomentosa, and Pistacia integerrima showed low cytotoxicity with a 50% cytotoxicity concentration value of >200\u2009\u03bcM. Results of this study indicate that there is potential in these natural extracts to become candidate drugs to be used as complementary and alternative medicine for HIV infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunopharmacology, Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms, National Kunming High Level Biosafety Research Center for Nonhuman Primates, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahzad", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunopharmacology, Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms, National Kunming High Level Biosafety Research Center for Nonhuman Primates, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4984-4373"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Tasleem", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rafi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Muhammad Shoaib", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Immunopharmacology, Key Laboratory of Animal Models and Human Disease Mechanisms, National Kunming High Level Biosafety Research Center for Nonhuman Primates, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yong-Tang", "Initials": "YT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705876", "ISSNLinking": "0146-6615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "UNAIDS.
