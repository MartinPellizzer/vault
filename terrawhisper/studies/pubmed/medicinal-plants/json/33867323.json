Beta vulgaris commonly referred to as garden beet is one of the most utilized vegetable especially in salad dressings. The Present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of lyophilized beet root on fertility and reproductive hormones. The study was carried out in January 2017 on two different animal models. For fertility purpose albino mice of both genders weighing 20-25gm were divided into 5 pairs for each group, First group was control given distilled water, next was treated I being given beetroot 500mg/kg and last one was given 1000mg/kg beetroot. Similarly 5 pairs were made of buck and doe's weighing 1.75gm-2.5gm and labelled as Control, Treated I and Treated II and were administered distilled water, 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg beetroot respectively. The pups were again mated after they grew up and in this way F1 generation was also observed. The kits were observed for presence of anomaly. The estrogen, progesterone and testosterone levels were evaluated at baseline, during pregnancy and post pregnancy in rabbit model. Improved fertility with no anomalies in the pups and kits were observed. The reproductive hormones were also highly significantly increased (p<0.001) as compared to baseline values. The study suggests that beetroot would be very beneficial in improving fertility and maintaining hormonal level during fertility hence it would prove to be very beneficial in maintaining pregnancy as well as treating infertility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sarfaraz", "ForeName": "Sana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ikram", "ForeName": "Rahela", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Osama", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Anser", "ForeName": "Humera", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Beta vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33867323"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
