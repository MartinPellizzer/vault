The artemisinin-TGB and -BSA conjugates were injected in female New Zealand rabbits but only the artemisinin-TGB conjugate generated polyclonal antibodies. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and the specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by comparison with pre-immune serum and by competitive assays using different dilutions of artemisinin standards. Although anti-artemisinin antibodies cross-reacted with artemisitene and dihydroartemisinin at all dilutions used, cross-reaction with deoxyartemisinin, artemisinic acid, and arteannuin B occurred only at high concentrations. ELISA successfully detected artemisinin from crude extracts in concentrations as low as 1.5 ng ml-1; and was epsilon 400-fold more sensitive than the HPLC-EC. The ELISA successfully detected and quantified artemisinin in different organs of greenhouse-grown plants and in eight clones of Artemisia annua grown in tissue culture but artemisinin was overestimated owing to cross-reactivity of the antibodies with artemisinin-related compounds present in the samples. Despite overestimation of artemisinin content, the correlations between ELISA and HPLC-EC were r = 0.92 when samples were diluted 100 times, and r = 0.90 when samples were diluted 500 times, indicating that ELISA is a potential tool for screening large A. annua populations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1165, USA."}], "LastName": "Ferreira", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Janick", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8588880", "10.1016/0031-9422(95)00542-0", "0031-9422(95)00542-0"]}}]}
