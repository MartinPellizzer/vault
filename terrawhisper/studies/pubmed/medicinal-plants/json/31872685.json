Accurately mastering the information of the distribution,area and yield of Chinese medicinal materials cultivation is the basis of the adjustment of the planting structure of traditional Chinese medicine. It is now the largest planting place of Mongolian traditional Chinese medicinal materials in Naiman banner that is belonging to Tongliao city,Inner Mongolia. It is of great significance to obtain the planting area of Mongolian Chinese medicinal materials in Naiman banner in time and effectively for the development of subsequent industries. In this study,Saposhnikovia divaricata,a medicinal plant planted in Naiman banner,was selected as an example,and the fusion 2 m resolution ZY-3 remote sensing image was used as the data source. Based on the ground survey data,the sample data of each typical ground object were selected,and the spectral characteristic curves of different ground objects were obtained,and the S. divaricata spectral information was obtained. Using the filtering texture analysis method based on probability statistics,five kinds of texture image display results under different texture filtering were compared and analyzed,and finally the S. divaricata texture features based on information entropy are determined. The distribution range and planting area of S. divaricata in Naiman banner were extracted and interpreted by using the texture and spectral information of remote sensing images. The results showed that: S. divaricata was mainly distributed in the northeast and central south of Naiman banner,and the planting area was 5 336 mu( 1 mu\u2248667 m<sup>2</sup>). The field verification data were in good agreement with the remote sensing interpretation results,and the difference was small. It shows that the combination of spectral information and texture information can realize the discrimination of S. divaricata,and the interpretation results can provide a reference for the county to formulate the poverty alleviation action of Chinese medicinal material industry and the economic development plan of agricultural producing areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities Inner Mongolia,Tongliao 028000,China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jun-Ying", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Characteristic Geoherbs Resources Protection and Utilization Baotou Medical College Baotou 014060,China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs,National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs,National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Characteristic Geoherbs Resources Protection and Utilization Baotou Medical College Baotou 014060,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia Key Laboratory of Characteristic Geoherbs Resources Protection and Utilization Baotou Medical College Baotou 014060,China Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Academy of Chinese Medicine Hohhot 010020,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min-Hui", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872685", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190731.111"]}}]}
