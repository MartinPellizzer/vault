Among those studied, Ficus carica has shown to have a significant ability to inhibit tumor formation and development of cancer cells through modulating various signaling mechanisms and interaction including a large number of cell signaling molecules.", "The goal of this study is to provide a critical and complete evaluation of F. carica's anticancer capacity in various malignancies, as well as related molecular targets.", "Research was conducted electronically on scholarly scientific databases, including Science Direct, PubMed, and Scopus. Published papers were analyzed and investigated using the keywords, Ficus carica, figs, cancer, malignancies and tumor based on established selection criteria. In this systematic review, 27 individual studies were considered.", "Treatment with F. carica alone or in combination with other medications was linked to anticancer activity with significant evidence. Furthermore, F. carica has been shown to use multitargeted pathways to prevent cancer initiation and development by modulating numerous dysregulated signaling cascades involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, autophagy inflammatory processes, metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis.", "Our findings suggest that F. carica and its phytochemicals have the potential for cancer prevention and therapy. Nonetheless, additional mechanistic studies with pure compounds derived from F. carica and well-designed clinical trials are needed to advance our knowledge to clinical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
