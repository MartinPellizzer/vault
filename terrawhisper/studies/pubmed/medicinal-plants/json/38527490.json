Seventeen years later, in the field of herbal medicinal products, results are still sobering. Therefore, the Foundation Plants for Health, Society for Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research, and German Society for Phytotherapy organised a symposium to assess the status quo for the paediatric use of herbal medicinal products (HMPs), to analyse the causes of the current situation, and to discuss strategies for establishing the proof of safe and efficacious HMPs for children.The current situation for HMPs and their use in children is not fulfilling the requirements of legislation. HMPs in paediatrics are effective and safe, but considering the needs of children is necessary. In European countries, the use, registration, and marketing of HMPs are different, depending on the respective national regulations and specific traditions. EU herbal monographs are the best common denominator for such procedures. Emerging safety discussions must be considered. New approaches with real-world data might be a solution. The regulatory framework is to be adapted. Defining rationalised dosing for HMPs can be achieved by the extrapolation of data from adults, by using existing clinical data for children, and by using RWD. Therefore, a strong need for revising restrictions for the use of HMPs in children and rationalising defined dosage regimes is obvious."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
