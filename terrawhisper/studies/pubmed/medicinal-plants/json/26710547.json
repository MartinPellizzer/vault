Contrary to the belief of being natural and safe products, their hepatotoxic potential is recognized in several studies worldwide, and represent a health problem that deserves greater attention. The reported prevalence of hepatotoxicity associated with botanicals is variable and depends on various factors such as population, period and design of the study. There have been reports of a total of 60 products with herbal medicinal and dietary purposes, which may cause liver damage; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. Their clinical and histological features, not unlike liver injury associated with drugs in most patients, have a pattern of hepatocellular injury. Diagnosis is by exclusion, and represents a clinical challenge. It is essential the clinical suspicion and the differential diagnosis with other acute and chronic conditions. Hence, future researches are aimed at improving existing diagnostic methods and introducing new toxicological, genetic and immunological technologies. Treatment is complex and presents a challenge for the specialist, as there are no antidotes. Management based on the discontinued use of the product and in the symptomatic treatment, decreases the progression to an acute fulminant hepatic failure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mengual-Moreno", "ForeName": "Edgardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lizarz\u00e1bal-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Maribel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Rinc\u00f3n", "ForeName": "Ileana", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barboza-Nobrega", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda De Freitas", "Initials": "Mde F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Hepatotoxicidad asociada a hierbas y productos nutricionales de origen bot\u00e1nico."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Invest Clin", "NlmUniqueID": "0421531", "ISSNLinking": "0535-5133"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26710547"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
