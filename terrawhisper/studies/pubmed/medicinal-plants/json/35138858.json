The terminal alkene substrate produced sulfone-containing 1,3-oxazines and tetrahydropyrimidines in the presence of Cu(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and DPP, and under similar reaction conditions, sulfonylated tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepines were prepared from 1-aryl-substituted <i>O</i>-homoallyl benzimidates in moderate to good yields. For certain electron-rich 1,1-diaryl-substituted alkene substrates, the corresponding tetrahydro-1,3-oxazepines could also be obtained in similar or even higher yields via a green electrochemical technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis & Chiral Drug Synthesis of Guizhou Province, Key Laboratory of Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education and Joint International Research Laboratory of Ethnomedicine of Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563003, P.
