It is unclear whether Styrax or Styrax-related herbal medicines may trigger clinically relevant herb-drug interactions.", "This study was carried out to investigate the inhibitory effects of Styrax on human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and to clarify whether this herb may modulate the pharmacokinetic behavior of the CYP-substrate drug warfarin when co-administered.", "The inhibitory effects of Styrax on CYPs were assayed in human liver microsomes (HLM), while the pharmacokinetic interactions between Styrax and warfarin were investigated in rats. The bioactive constituents in Styrax with strong CYP3A inhibitory activity were identified and their inhibitory mechanisms were carefully investigated.", "The inhibitory effects of Styrax on human CYPs were assayed in vitro, while the pharmacokinetic interactions between Styrax and warfarin were studied in rats. Fingerprinting analysis of Styrax coupled with LC-TOF-MS/MS profiling and CYP inhibition assays were used to identify the constituents with strong CYP3A inhibitory activity. The inhibitory mechanism of oleanonic acid (the most potent CYP3A inhibitor occurring in Styrax) against CYP3A4 was investigated by a panel of inhibition kinetics analyses and in silico analysis.", "In vitro assays demonstrated that Styrax extract strongly inhibited human CYP3A and moderately inhibited six other tested human CYPs, as well as potently inhibited warfarin 10-hydroxylation in liver microsomes from both humans and rats. In vivo assays demonstrated that compared with warfarin given individually in rats, Styrax (100\u00a0mg/kg) significantly prolonged the plasma half-life of warfarin by 2.3-fold and increased the AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> of warfarin by 2.7-fold when this herb was co-administrated with warfarin (2\u00a0mg/kg) in rats. Two LC fractions were found with strong CYP3A inhibitory activity and the major constituents in these fractions were characterized by LC-TOF-MS/MS. Five pentacyclic triterpenoid acids (including epibetulinic acid, betulinic acid, betulonic acid, oleanonic acid and maslinic acid) present in Styrax were potent CYP3A inhibitors, and oleanonic acid was a competitive inhibitor against CYP3A-mediated testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation.", "Styrax and the pentacyclic triterpenoid acids occurring in this herb strongly modulate the pharmacokinetic behavior of warfarin via inhibition of CYP3A."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
