One-fourth of the recorded remedies were represented by food-medicines. Half of the ingredients quoted came originally from Turkey; only a few plants were gathered from the wild or cultivated in the Cologne area. This article discusses the Turkish migrants' frequent use of aerial parts of Sideritis species, the fruits of Pistacia terebinthus and the seeds of Peganum harmala from the perspective of modern phytopharmacology, phytotherapy and toxicology. It considers cultural adaptation related to the use of folk pharmaceuticals by analysing the ingredients of the Turkish folk pharmacopoeia and comparing them with those of the Turkish medical ethnobotany and of the phytotherapy of the host country (Germany). Only one third of the remedies mentioned by Turkish migrants living in Cologne are also known in German evidence-based phytotherapy, and less than 10% of the recorded phytotherapeutic uses are common to both pharmacopoeias. This article concludes by suggesting hypotheses on future changes affecting the knowledge and use of medicinal plants within the Turkish community of Cologne."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SCH Group, Department of Social Sciences, Wageningen University and Research Centre, Postbus 8060, NL-6700 DA Wageningen, The Netherlands. a.pieroni@netcologne.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pieroni", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muenz", "ForeName": "Harald", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akbulut", "ForeName": "Minire", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ba\u015fer", "ForeName": "Kemal H\u00fcsn\u00fc Can", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Durmu\u015fkahya", "ForeName": "Cenk", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transients and Migrants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16002248", "10.1016/j.jep.2005.05.018", "S0378-8741(05)00333-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
