However, little is known about its possible effects on the behavior of immune cells. The effects of Traumeel were examined in vitro on the ability of resting and PHA-, PMA- or TNF-alpha-activated human T cells, monocytes, and gut epithelial cells to secrete the prototypic pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-8 over a period of 24-72 h. Traumeel inhibited the secretion of all three agents in resting, as well as activated immune cells. IL-beta secretion was reduced by up to 70% in both resting and activated cells; TNF-alpha secretion was reduced by up to 65 and 54%, respectively, and IL-8 secretion was reduced by 50% in both resting and activated cells (P < 0.01 for all cells). Interestingly, the effect appeared to be inversely dose-related; maximal inhibition (usually 30-60% inhibition; P < 0.01) was seen with dilutions of 10(-3)-10(-6) of the Traumeel stock material. This finding suggests that Traumeel does not inhibit immune cells functions by exerting a toxic effect. Indeed, Traumeel did not affect T cell and monocyte proliferation. Although additional studies are needed to clarify the mode of action of Traumeel and to demonstrate causative relationship between the inhibition of cytokine/chemokine secretion in cell culture and the reported clinical effects of the preparation, our in vitro results offer a mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of Traumeel observed in clinical use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Center for Integrative Complementary Medicine, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem 91031, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Porozov", "ForeName": "Svetlana", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cahalon", "ForeName": "Liora", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weiser", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Branski", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lider", "ForeName": "Ofer", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oberbaum", "ForeName": "Menachem", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Egypt", "MedlineTA": "Clin Dev Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "101183692", "ISSNLinking": "1740-2522"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-8"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Traumeel S"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coculture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-8"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15330450", "PMC2270708", "10.1080/10446670410001722203", "S1740252204000198"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
