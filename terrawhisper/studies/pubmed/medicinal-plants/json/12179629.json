{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["Clinical studies on the antifertility effect; site of action; pharmacokinetics and toxicity of gossypol, a yellowish pigment occurring in certain species of cotton plant with a reputed contraceptive effect, were first carried out in 1972. Some 4000 Chinese men had used gossypol contraceptive pill for at least 6 months, and some for more than 4 years. Reported efficacy rate of the pill was 99.89%. Male fertility returned by 3 months after discontinuation of the pill, and there were no apparent serious side effects on the babies borne by the wives of the men who had stopped using gossypol. A study by Lee and Malling suggests that gossypol works by inhibiting an enzyme that has a crucial role in the metabolism of sperm and sperm-generating cells. Gossypol is toxic to nonruminant animals, including humans. This toxicity has precluded the economic utilization of cottenseed product for human nutrition. Cottenseed oil, however, is used in food preparation and cooking as salad oil, shortening, and margarine. The mechanism of gossypol's toxicity is not well understood. Toxicity may be due to the action of gossypol on specific enzymes, or interference with amino acid, protein, or iron metabolism. Clinical research suggest that increasing the dietary level of quality of protein minimizes or eliminates the physiologic effects of ingested gossypol within limits. If human reaction to gossypol is similar to that of animal reaction, a diet lacking adequate levels of protein, iron or certain minerals could adversely affect its efficacy and safety, and malnutrition could severely affect gossypol toxicity and its antifertility factors. Carefully designed clinical trials should be done to determine dose-response, efficacy, side effects, metabolic effects, and reversibility potential of gossypol. If gossypol is found to be a new non-steroidal contraceptive method which could be highly effective and reversible, fully safe and inexpensive, it could very well be the answer to the world's population problem."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["001993", "00087365"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: Research Frontiers in Fertility Regulation"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["China", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents, Male--side effects", "Contraceptive Agents--side effects", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Literature Review", "Medicine", "Nutrition", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12179629", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "10", "Day": "05"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0278-5188", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "May"}}, "Title": "Research frontiers in fertility regulation : RFFR", "ISOAbbreviation": "Res Front Fertil Regul"}, "ArticleTitle": "Gossypol: a possible male antifertility agent.
