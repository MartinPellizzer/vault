They showed a dose-dependent decrease in the growth of HL-60 cells. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition of the growth (IC50) after 96 h were 4.03 microM, 0.12 microM and 30.98 microM for Vx-1, Vx-5 and Vx-6, respectively. Treatment of HL-60 cells with the flavonoids induced morphological changes that are characteristic of apoptosis. We judged the induction of apoptosis by the detection of DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis and the degree of apoptosis was quantified by a double-antibody sandwich ELISA and by flow cytometric analysis. The C-3 hydroxyl and C-8 methoxyl groups were found not to be essential for the activity, but the C-3' methoxyl instead of hydroxyl group lowered the antiproliferative and apoptosis inducing activity. These results suggest that the polymethoxyflavonoids isolated from V. rotundifolia may be used as potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Medicinal Resource Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "N Y", "Initials": "NY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2'3',5-trihydroxy-3,6,7-trimethoxyflavone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11039319", "10.1016/s0278-6915(00)00079-x", "S0278-6915(00)00079-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
