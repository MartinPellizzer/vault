The structures of the twenty-four newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR and ESI-MS. The in vitro anti-cancer activity against chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562), erythroleukemia cells (HEL), human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) of the target compounds was evaluated. Among them, compounds 15d, 15f, 15h, and 15i showed the significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) stronger growth inhibitory activity on K562 than those of the positive controls of paclitaxel and colchicine, while compounds 15a, 15d, 15e, and 15h displayed significantly stronger growth inhibitory activity on HEL than those of the positive controls. However, all the target compounds exhibited weaker growth inhibition activity against K562 and HeLa than those of the positive controls. The selectivity ratio of compounds 15h, 15d, and 15i were significantly higher than those of other active compounds, indicating that these three compounds had the lower hepatotoxicity. Several compounds displayed strong inhibition against leukemia cells. They inhibited tubulin polymerization, disrupted cellular microtubule networks by targeting the colchicine site, and promoted cell cycle arrest of leukemia cells at G2/M phase and cell apoptosis, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis. In summary, our research provided that novel synthesized N-aryl-2-trifluoromethyl-quinazoline-4-amine active derivatives as the inhibitors of tubulin polymerization in leukemia cells, which might be a valuable lead compounds for anti-leukemia agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
