While the cannabinoids share a common precursor molecule, cannabigerol, they are structurally and pharmacologically unique. These differences may engender differing therapeutic potentials. In this review, we will examine what is currently known about CBC with regards to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and receptor profile. We will also discuss the therapeutic areas that have been examined for this cannabinoid, notably antinociceptive, antibacterial, and anti-seizure activities. Finally, we will discuss areas where new research is needed and potential novel medicinal applications for CBC. <b>Significance Statement</b> Cannabichromene (CBC) has been suggested to have disparate therapeutic benefits such as anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, and antinociceptive effects. Most of the focus on the medical benefits of cannabinoids has been focused on THC and CBD. The preliminary studies on CBC indicate that this phytocannabinoid may have unique therapeutic potential that warrants further investigation. Following easier access to hemp, CBC products are commercially available over-the-counter and are being widely utilized with little or no evidence of their safety or efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors.
