ZDF rats were fed regular laboratory chow mixed with SP or rosiglitazone (RSG) for an 8-week period. Kidney hypertrophy was developed with increasing plasma glucose level, and glomerular hypertrophy was improved by 22% and 45% in SP- and RSG-treated rats, respectively. Urinary glucose and albumin excretions were also significantly lower in SP-treated rats than in ZDF control rats. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1)-fibronectin pathway in kidney, responsible for glomerular dysfunction, was markedly blunted by SP treatment in a dose dependent manner. Our findings, for the first time, provide strong evidence that long-term administration of SP formula prevents the development and progression of DN in ZDF rats. Human trials are needed to confirm these experimental results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University, Seoul 130-701, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Youn Young", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Kwi Man", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Sung Hyun", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TGFB1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tgfb1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Nephropathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Administration Schedule"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypertrophy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Zucker"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12510848", "10.1007/BF02977014"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
