The plants were air dried, cut, and processed using different organic solvents. The contraceptive properties of the plants were studied in rats, mice, and hamsters. Doses of 100-200 mg/kg of 137 plants were given orally to 5-6 animals for each plant. 27 appeared promising enough for further testing in which 2-3 extracts of each plant were administered to adult rats. The contraceptive action of 14 plants was confirmed. Significant contraceptive effects were seen after administration of Crotalaria juncea Linn, Verbena hybrida Linn, Verbena bonariensis Linn, and Pueraria tuberosa. Embelia ribes Burm and Artabotrys odoratissimus Linn were found to have interesting biologic properties but strong toxic effects. P. tuberosa had strong estrogenic and progestational effects but was not toxic in a dose of 500 mg/kg for 30 days in adult rats. A hormone study and trial with P. tuberosa should be undertaken with a view to eventual development of an oral contraceptive."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["029953", "00147868"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION, FERTILITE, SEXUALITE"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Asia", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproductive Control Agents", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12340145", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "09", "Day": "09"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["fre"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0301-861X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "13", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "Contraception, fertilite, sexualite", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contracept Fertil Sex (Paris)"}, "ArticleTitle": "[Biological evaluation of some medicinal plant extracts for contraceptive efficacy in females].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "649", "EndPage": "655", "MedlinePgn": "649-55"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Evaluation biologique de l'efficacite de l'action contraceptive d'extraits de certaines plantes medicinales chez la femme."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Contracept Fertil Sex (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "0411244", "ISSNLinking": "0301-861X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reproductive Control Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproductive Control Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12340145"]}}]}
