Quercetin has significant anti-diabetic effects and may be helpful in lowering blood sugar and increasing insulin sensitivity. Quercetin appears to affect many factors and signaling pathways involved in insulin resistance and the pathogenesis of type 2 of diabetes. TNF\u03b1, NFKB, AMPK, AKT, and NRF2 are among the factors that are affected by quercetin. In addition, quercetin can be effective in preventing and ameliorating the diabetic complications, including diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular complications, neuropathy, delayed wound healing, and retinopathy, and affects the key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these complications. These positive effects of quercetin may be related to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. In this article, after a brief review of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, we will review the latest findings on the anti-diabetic effects of quercetin with a molecular perspective. Then we will review the effects of quercetin on the key mechanisms of pathogenesis of diabetes complications including nephropathy, cardiovascular complications, neuropathy, delayed wound healing, and retinopathy. Finally, clinical trials investigating the effect of quercetin on diabetes and diabetes complications will be reviewed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Experimental Centre, Xi'an International Medical Center Hospital, Xi'an, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pre-Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kajang, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student's Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vaghari-Tabari", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student's Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malakoti", "ForeName": "Faezeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moein", "ForeName": "Soheila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7082-3713"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center (CMBRC), Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Qujeq", "ForeName": "Durdi", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asemi", "ForeName": "Zatollah", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35468007", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2067825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
