The aim of this study was to explore the non-volatile secondary metabolites and the phytochemical variation within these lesser known species, to support product development and commercialisation. Chemical profiles of the methanol extracts of 81 wild-harvested samples were obtained using ultra performance-quadrupole-Time-of-Flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-qToF-MS). Forty-one compounds, including caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, carnosol, carnosic acid and ursolic acid, were detected and confirmed across the three species. Nineteen compounds were tentatively identified of which 14 have not been reported in these species. Principal component analysis revealed distinct clusters corresponding to the three species, confirming chemical differences. Marker compounds for each species were revealed using orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis. Further chemometric analysis reflected a degree of intraspecies variation, although the chemistry within populations was mostly conserved. Potential chemotypes for each species were identified through unique compounds associated with each group. The concentrations of medicinally important metabolites, namely, rosmarinic acid, carnosol, carnosic acid and ursolic acid, were determined, using validated UPLC-PDA methods. Ursolic acid was present at levels up to 38.2\u00a0mg/g, confirming that these species are a rich source of this compound. No similar studies combining liquid chromatography with chemometric analysis, and utilising a large sample size from various habitats, have been reported for these three Salvia species. The results will guide selection of cultivars with the best attributes for the intended therapeutic application, thereby protecting wild populations from over-exploitation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
