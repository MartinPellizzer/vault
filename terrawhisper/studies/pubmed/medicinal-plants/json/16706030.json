The wound surfaces were randomly divided into two groups, namely, experimental group and control group. The wound surfaces in the experimental group were treated by arnebia root oil and those in control group were treated by petrolatum gauze. Then raw surfaces were evaluated by the techniques of histology, histochemistry and electron microscope and the healing rates of the raw surfaces were compared between the two groups. Content of bFGF and it's mRNA expression in wound surface tissue was also measured by means of Western-blot and RT-PCR.", "The wound surface healing rate in experimental group was higher than that in control group( P < 0.05). The fibroblast, collagen and blood capillaries were comparatively richer in experimental group as compared with those in control group, and similarly, the expression of bFGF mRNA was also significantly enhanced in the experimental group as compared with control group during the various periods of treatment. In addition, the changes in the expressions of bFGF and it's mRNA paralleled the changes of healing rates in the two groups.", "the present results showed that amebia root oil significantly can promote the healing of raw surfaces, which may be mediated by up-regulation of bFGF expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Second Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, China. peixianwu@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Xian-Wu", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kun-Zheng", "Initials": "KZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jin-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Zhi-Bin", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Deng-Feng", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "103107-01-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boraginaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblast Growth Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16706030"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
