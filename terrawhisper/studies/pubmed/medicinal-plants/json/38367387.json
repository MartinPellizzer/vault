To study the molecular mechanisms of corolla coloration in R. dauricum, integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics were performed in R. dauricum featuring purple flowers and R. dauricum var. album featuring white flowers. Comparative metabolomics revealed 25 differential metabolites in the corolla of the two distinct colors, enriched in flavonoids that are closely related to pigmentation in the flower. Differential analysis of the transcriptomics data revealed enrichment of structural genes for flavonoid biosynthesis (99 up- and 58 down-regulated, respectively, in purple corollas compared to white ones). Significantly, CHS and CHI, key genes in the early stage of anthocyanin synthesis, as well as F3H, F3'H, F3'5'H, DFR, ANS, and UFGT that promote the accumulation of pigments in the late stage of anthocyanin synthesis, were up-regulated in R. dauricum (purple color). In R. dauricum var. album, FLS were key genes determining the accumulation of flavonols. In addition, transcriptome-metabolome correlation analysis identified 16 R2R3 MYB transcription factors (out of 83 MYBs) that are important for corolla coloration. Five negative and four positive MYBs were further identified by integrated transcriptional and metabolic network analysis, revealing a key role of MYBA and MYB12 in regulating anthocyanins and flavonols, respectively. Moreover, we validated the function of RdMYBA by creating stable transgenic plants and found that RdMYBA promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis. In summary, we systematically characterized the transcriptome and metabolome of two R. dauricum cultivars with different flower colors and identified MYBs as key factors in modulating corolla coloration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
