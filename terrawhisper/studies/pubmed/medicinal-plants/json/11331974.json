Ultrastructural changes that contribute to such events remain unknown. Therefore, the effect of water deprivation for 24 hr, (as a model for dehydration) on the ultrastructure of mouse pial microvessels was investigated. The possible beneficial effect of garlic in preventing such ultrastructural changes was also investigated. Four groups of TO strain: control, control-garlic treated, dehydrated, and dehydrated-garlic treated male mice, 10/group, were used. Dehydration was induced by water deprivation for 24 hr. Garlic solution was i.p. injected at 0.1 ml/10g body weight. In urethane-anesthetized (2 mg/g, i.p.) mice, topical and transvessel bimodal fixation of pial microvessels was done with a phosphate buffered mixture of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde, followed by a conventional electron microscopy procedure. Examination of control cerebral pial microvessels showed no evidence of cellular damage. Membranes of endothelial cells were intact. Within pial microvessels there was no evidence of platelet aggregation. Garlic treatments did not cause any ultrastructure abnormalities in control mice. Compared with control, dehydration caused the appearance of thrombi that consisted of platelet aggregates. Discoid platelets containing granules, spheroid degranulated platelets, and those with large pseudopodia were present in 80% of dehydrated mice. The venular endothelial surface of dehydrated mice revealed dilated profiles of endoplasmic reticulum and variously shaped vacuoles. Swelling of nuclear envelopes and mitochondrial distension were also present in dehydrated mice. Concomitant garlic treatment prevented most of these ultrastructural changes. These findings demonstrated the extent of damage to the pial microvessels in response to water deprivation and demonstrated the beneficial effect of garlic as a possible mean of protection against oncoming vascular pathology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. m.fahim@uaeu.ac.ae"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fahim", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Sabban", "ForeName": "F F", "Initials": "FF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anat Rec", "NlmUniqueID": "0370540", "ISSNLinking": "0003-276X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebrovascular Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dehydration"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microcirculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Pia Mater"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11331974", "10.1002/ar.1080", "10.1002/ar.1080"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
