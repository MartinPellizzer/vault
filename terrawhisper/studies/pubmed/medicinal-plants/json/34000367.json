These areas, one of the last storehouses of traditional knowledge are under the constant threat of losing this valuable information as it moves from one generation to another through word of mouth. Modernization, migration, education, and changing socio-economic status of people also affect the perpetuality of traditional knowledge. Therefore, time-to-time updation of information regarding the ethnomedicinal plants must be carried out so that any addition to the traditional knowledge is recorded and further phytochemical and pharmacological studies may be conducted for developing new drugs.", "The study aimed at documenting the traditional knowledge and practices about the medicinal plants used by the inhabitants of Pauri district of Uttarakhand. Besides, the study strives to identify plants for future phytochemical and pharmacological studies.", "The information was collected through semi-structured questionnaire from 98 informants distributed in 15 villages of Pauri. The data was analyzed for use-reports (UR), frequency of citation (FC) and informant consensus factor (F<sub>IC</sub>).", "In the present study, total 236 species belonging to 80 families and 188 genera were found to treat 82 ailments. Asteraceae (23 species), Rosaceae (16 species) and Lamiaceae (13 species) were the most represented families. Correlation and regression analysis between the local flora and present study reveals that Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Asteraceae were the main outlier species having more representatives in local flora than medicinally important species. Herbs (57.2%) were the most frequently used life forms, and leaves (24.5%) the most commonly utilized plant parts. All the plants were collected from the natural resources and none of them was under cultivation. Nearly 76% of the total drugs were administered orally. The informants divulged 1556 use-reports. The most utilized species based on frequency of citation were Urtica dioica L. (44), Bergenia ciliata Haworth (38), Viola canescens Wall. (38), Rhododendron arboretum Smith (32), and Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (30). All the disorders were grouped into 13 ailment categories based on ICPC-2 classification. The main ailment categories as per Informant Consensus Factor (F<sub>IC</sub>) were digestive (F<sub>IC</sub>, 0.83), urological (F<sub>IC</sub>, 0.83) and cardiovascular (F<sub>IC</sub>, 0.81) disorders. A comparative analysis between the present and other local and regional studies show that as many as 13 species were new record for the state of Uttarakhand.", "The inhabitants of Pauri have good knowledge of medicinal plants. Although the therapeutic value of most of the preferred medicinal plants has already been validated, some medicinal plants lack proper scientific validation. We recommend further phytochemical investigations and pharmacological validations of Begonia picta Smith, Citrus pseudolimon Tanka, Cotoneaster rotundifolia Wall., Heracleum canescens Lindl., Parochetus communis Buch-Ham., Pittosporum napaulense DC., and Plantago erosa Wall."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
