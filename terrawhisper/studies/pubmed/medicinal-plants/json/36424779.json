Blastocystis hominis (B. hominis) is the recognizable human isolates in clinical and diagnostic specimens. Human infection occurs via the oro-fecal route, particularly in developing areas due to the lack of sanitation and hygienic facilities. B. hominis can exist in the large intestine for weeks to years until treated appropriately. Metronidazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of Blastocystis infection. However, it induces intolerable side effects and has been shown to have teratogenic and carcinogenic potential. Several medicinal plant extracts have been experimentally tested against Blastocystis infection in comparison to currently available treatments.", "Based on in vitro and in vivo studies, this article reviewed anti-Blastocystis activity of some medicinal plants.", "To conduct the research for this review, Google Scholar and PubMed were the primary search engines used to find relevant literature. A total of 19 published in vitro and in vivo studies were evaluated to identify the anti-Blastocystis effects of various medicinal plants.", "Multiplication of Blastocystis parasites as well as nucleic acids and protein synthesis, all be inhibited by extracts from different medicinal plants. These natural agents have been shown to be both safe and effective when compared to the existing treatment options.", "Different medicinal plants can combat Blastocystis infection and could be a good substitute for metronidazole and other synthetic treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Parasitology Department, Research Institute of Ophthalmology, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mostafa El-Sayed", "ForeName": "Nagwa", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Gamal Masoud", "ForeName": "Nagham", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Adv Antiinfect Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "9918266300206676", "ISSNLinking": "2772-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "140QMO216E", "NameOfSubstance": "Metronidazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blastocystis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Metronidazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Blastocystis Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blastocystis hominis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36424779", "10.2174/2772434418666221124123445", "RAAIDD-EPUB-127814"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
