A slightly higher O2-. level was also detected in the parts of leaves surrounding the inoculation side. Overproduction of O2-. was observed earlier than the increase in peroxidase activity. Pretreatment of the leaves with methyl jasmonate enhanced both O2-. production and peroxidase activity following inoculation with B. cinerea. Induction of superoxide dismutase activity after the infection was less pronounced than changes in O2-. level. The differences in the rate of NADH oxidation in the extracts from control and inoculated leaves, correlated with the differences in the rate of O2-. production. The results indicate that O2-. level is one of the essential factors responsible for the difference in the interactions between bean plant and compatible and incompatible pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, University of L\u00f3d\u017a, Poland."}], "LastName": "Urbanek", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gajewska", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karwowska", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wielanek", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biochim Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "14520300R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-527X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9104504"]}}]}
