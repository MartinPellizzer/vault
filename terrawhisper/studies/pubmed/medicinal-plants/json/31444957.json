The ER has to accommodate the proper folding and glycosylation of these proteins and also to properly incorporate transmembrane proteins. However, under various circumstances, the proteins shuttling through the ER can be misfolded and undergo aggregation, which causes activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is mediated through three primary pathways: activating transcription factor-6, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1), and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, which up-regulate ER folding chaperones and temporarily suppress protein translation. The UPR can be both cytoprotective and/or cytotoxic depending on the duration of UPR activation and the type of host cell. Proteostasis controls stem cell function, while stress responses affect stem cell identity and differentiation. The present review aimed to explore and discuss the effects of the UPR pathways on mesenchymal stem cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Genetics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Tavasolian", "ForeName": "Fataneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Ahmad Z", "Initials": "AZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular & Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Immunology and Allergy, Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Jandaghi", "ForeName": "Pouria", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soudi", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell-Based Therapies Research Center, Digestive Disease Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naderi", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Development Center, Imam Hasan Hospital, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunogenetic and Cell Culture Department, Immunology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saburi", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Department of Medical Biotechnology, Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtazi-Borojeni", "ForeName": "Amir Abbas", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Science, School of Pharmacy, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri."}], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Thomas P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8656-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "IUBMB Life", "NlmUniqueID": "100888706", "ISSNLinking": "1521-6543"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenchymal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Unfolded Protein Response"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Balchin D, Hayer-Hartl M, Hartl FU.
