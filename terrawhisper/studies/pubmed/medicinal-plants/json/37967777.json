This predicament implies the urgent need to discover novel antimalarial drugs candidate from alternative natural sources. The Himalaya constitute a rich repository of medicinal plants which have been used traditionally in the folklore medicine since ages and having no scientific evidence for their activity. Crambe kotschyana Boiss. and Eremurus himalaicus Baker are used for their antipyretic and hepatoprotective properties in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, India.", "This study would investigate the antiplasmodial efficacy of C. kotschyana and E. himalaicus extracts, their fractions and active components using in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches to provide a scientific insight into their activity.", "The methanol extracts of C. kotschyana (CKME) and E. himalaicus (EHME) were prepared by maceration followed by fractionation using ethyl acetate. The isolation of flavonoid glycosides isorhamnetin-3, 7-di-O-glucoside from C. kotschyana and luteolin-6-C-glucoside (isoorientin) from E. himalaicus was carried out by antiplasmodial activity-guided isolation. In vitro antimalarial activity was assessed by WHO method while in vitro cytotoxicity was ascertained employing the MTT assay. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation were performed using the Glide module of Schr\u00f6dinger Software and Gromacs-2022 software package respectively. In vivo curative activity was assessed by Ryley and Peters method.", "The methanol extracts of both the plants illustrated the best antiplasmodial activity followed by the ethyl acetate fractions. Iso-orientin (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.49\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and Isorhamnetin-3,7-di-O-glucoside (IC<sub>50</sub> 9.22\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) illustrated considerable in vitro activity even against P. falciparum resistant strain. Extracts/fractions as well as the isolated compounds were found to be non-toxic with CC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0640\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Molecular docking studies were performed with these 2 O-glucosides against four malaria targets to understand the binding pose of these molecules and the results suggested that these molecules have selectivity for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. CKME and EHME exhibited curative activity in vivo along with increase in Mean Survival Time of mice.", "The research delineated the scientific evidence that both the therapeutic herbs possessed antimalarial activity and notably, bioactive compounds responsible to exhibit the antimalarial activity have been isolated, identified and characterized. Further studies are underway to assess the antiplasmodial efficacy of isolated compounds alone and in combination with standard antimalarials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
