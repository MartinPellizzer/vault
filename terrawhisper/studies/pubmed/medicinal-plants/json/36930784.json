She took the plant powders from July 1, 2021, to October 1, 2021, with the intention of relieving the symptoms of her subjectively irritated gastrointestinal tract. The patient's main symptoms of acute hepatitis were progressively increasing general fatigue, nausea, and exhaustion. During an inpatient hospital admission from November 4, 2021, to November 9, 2021, she was under clinical observation, but no specific therapeutic measures were deemed necessary; however, blood chemistry showed an acute toxic hepatitis. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of acute liver failure. Aminotransferase values decreased to normal values on December 14, 2021, by themselves. This case report contributes to the ongoing discussion about the potential risks of triggering an acute hepatitis due to the intake of herbal remedies from the <i>Tinospora</i> genus in rare cases, differentiating other involved risk factors. The case also shows that causality assignments are not trivial in the context of multivariate clinical scenarios. In the case of known hepatic metabolism-associated risk factors, <i>T. cordifolia</i> should be used with more caution based on available case reports. At the same time, no hasty and exaggerated prejudgments should be made about this medicinal herb, which has been very successfully used in traditional South Asian systems of medicine for many centuries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "May", "ForeName": "Katharina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Jeitler", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Integrative Health, London, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "Vijayendra", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stapelfeldt", "ForeName": "Elmar", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7794-8375"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine, Immanuel Hospital Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kessler", "ForeName": "Christian S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Integr Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9918283075806676", "ISSNLinking": "2768-3605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Failure, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tinospora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36930784", "10.1089/jicm.2022.0755"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
