Despite the vast collection of antimicrobial studies being done on South African plants, there is still limited research on pathogens associated with oral infections. In consultation with the available ethnobotanical literature, this study investigates the antimicrobial efficacy of some South African medicinal plants against oral pathogens.", "To provide a detailed account of the antimicrobial properties of selected South African medicinal plants used traditionally to treat oral infections. The effect on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation and the toxicity profiles of these plants are also investigated.", "A total of 136 aqueous and organic extracts and six essential oils were prepared from 31 different plant species. These plant samples were screened for antimicrobial efficacy against nine oral pathogens using the micro-titre plate dilution assay. Plant extracts that were found to have noteworthy antimicrobial activity against S. mutans were further evaluated on the effect on S. mutans biofilm formation using the glass slide technique. The toxicity profiles of plant samples that were found to have noteworthy antimicrobial activity were evaluated using the brine shrimp lethality assay.", "The organic extract of Cissampelos torulosa stems displayed the lowest MIC value of 0.05mg/mL against both Lactobacillus spp. This high antimicrobial activity was also observed with the organic extract of Spirostachys africana leaves against Candida albicans. In some instances, a direct relationship was found between the traditional use of the plant and the antimicrobial activity observed. For example, noteworthy activity (MIC < 1.00mg/mL) was observed against all three Candida spp. when tested against Clematis brachiata (leaves), a plant traditionally used to treat oral thrush. Englerophytum magalismonatanum stems displayed notable activity against both Streptococcus spp. (MIC 0.83mg/mL against S. mutans and MIC 0.67mg/mL against S. sanguis). Spirostachys africana leaves displayed the greatest anti-adherent properties against S. mutans biofilm formation at both 24 and 48h, reducing the biofilm by 97.56% and 86.58% respectively. The majority of plant samples tested in the brine shrimp lethality assay (BSLA) were considered safe, however, 13 plant samples were considered toxic, at a concentration of 1mg/mL.", "Noteworthy antimicrobial activity for plants species such as C. brachiata and E. magalismonatnum provides validation for the traditional use of these plants. Spirostachys africana displayed the greatest reduction of adherent S. mutans cells. The BSLA results revealed that the majority of the plant samples were not toxic in nature. The findings from the results favour the potential use of these plants in treating oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal diseases and oral thrush."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
