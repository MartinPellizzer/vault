Seven constituents, with antioxidant capacity were isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra. The isolated compounds were identified as the isoflavans Hispaglabridin A (1), Hispaglabridin B (4), Glabridin (3), and 4'-O-Methylglabridin (2), the two chalcones, isoprenylchalcone derivative (5) and Isoliquiritigenin (6), and the isoflavone, Formononetin (7). Among these compounds, Glabridin constituted the major amount in the crude extract (11.6%, w/w) as detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The antioxidative capacities of the isolated compounds (1-7) were tested against beta-carotene destruction and LDL oxidation. The isoflavans (1-4) at a concentration of 50 microM inhibited beta-carotene consumption, following 90 min of incubation at 50 degrees C, similar to the inhibitory effect of the whole licorice crude extract (at 16 mg/1). The chalcones (5 and 6) exhibited moderate inhibition and the isoflavone 7 was almost inactive, whereas vitamin E (50 microM) completely inhibited beta-carotene consumption. The inhibitory effect of the constituents 1-7, at a concentration of 30 microM on 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced LDL oxidation was determined by measuring the amount of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and the amount of lipid peroxides. While compounds 1-6 exhibited high inhibitory activity, compound 7 and vitamin E were not active. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of Glabridin, on the formation of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (CLOOH), in an AAPH-induced LDL oxidation system was also shown. Glabridin, at 5 or 40-60 microM concentration, inhibited the CLOOH formation by 62% and 90%, respectively. These results suggest that constituents 1-6 are very potent antioxidants toward LDL oxidation with Glabridin being the most abundant and potent antioxidant. As LDL oxidation is a key event in the formation of the early atherosclerotic lesion, the use of these natural antioxidants may be proven beneficial to attenuate atherosclerosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Migal, Galilee Technological Center, Kiryat Shmona, Israel."}], "LastName": "Vaya", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Belinky", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aviram", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8709159", "ISSNLinking": "0891-5849"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "295DQC67BJ", "NameOfSubstance": "formononetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B9CTI9GB8F", "NameOfSubstance": "isoliquiritigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9199893", "10.1016/s0891-5849(97)00089-0", "S0891-5849(97)00089-0"]}}]}
