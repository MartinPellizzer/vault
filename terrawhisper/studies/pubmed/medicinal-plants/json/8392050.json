A second objective was to compare CMCase and 15N as relative bacterial colonization markers. At time zero, 15N-enriched ammonium sulfate was dosed into the rumen. Residues in nylon bags incubated for 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 h were analyzed for NDF, ADF, CMCase, and 15N. Rates of NDF and ADF disappearance were faster (P < .05) for red clover (RC) than for gamagrass (GG) or orchardgrass (OG) and for forages ground to pass a 2-mm screen (P < .05) than for those ground to pass a 5-mm screen. Cumulative area under the curve (AUC) of CMCase activity was related to both NDF disappearance (r2 = .93) and 15N AUC (r2 = .99), indicating that CMCase can be used to estimate relative colonization of cellulolytic particle-associated bacteria (PAB). During the first 18 h of incubation, RC had greater (P < .05) CMCase and 15N enrichment of in situ residues than did OG or GG. The RC residues also had a greater (P < .05) ratio of CMCase activity:15N enrichment; this was presumed to indicate that, during this time, RC supported a greater total PAB population and had a greater proportion of cellulolytic PAB than did either GG or OG. Differences in the colonization rate of forage particles by cellulolytic PAB relative to total PAB may account for differences in rate of fiber digestion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Ohio State University, Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Columbus 43210."}], "LastName": "Bowman", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Firkins", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "carboxymethylcellulase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cellulase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8392050", "10.2527/1993.7161623x"]}}]}
