A dual drug delivery system offers a potential approach for optimizing the inhibitory effects of PIT on melanoma proliferation and metastasis.", "To develop a dual drug delivery system based on PIT and to study its efficacy in inhibiting melanoma proliferation and metastasis.", "We constructed a multifunctional nano-porphyrin material (P18-APBA-HA) using the photosensitizer-purpurin 18 (P18), hyaluronic acid (HA), and 4-(aminomethyl) phenylboronic acid (APBA). The resulting P18-APBA-HA was inserted into a phospholipid membrane and the IDO inhibitor epacadostat (EPA) was loaded into the internal phase to prepare a dual drug delivery system (Lip\\EPA\\P18-APBA-HA). Moreover, we also investigated its physicochemical properties, targeting, anti-tumor immunity, and anti-tumor proliferation and metastasis effects.", "The designed system utilized the pH sensitivity of borate ester to realize an enhanced-targeting strategy to facilitate the drug distribution in tumor lesions and efficient receptor-mediated cellular endocytosis. The intracellular release of EPA from Lip\\EPA\\P18-APBA-HA was triggered by thermal radiation, thereby inhibiting IDO activity in the tumor microenvironment, and promoting activation of the immune response. Intravenous administration of Lip\\EPA\\P18-APBA-HA effectively induced anti-tumor immunity by promoting dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T cell activation, and regulatory T cell suppression, and regulating cytokine secretion, to inhibit the proliferation of melanoma and lung metastasis.", "The proposed nano-drug delivery system holds promise as offers a promising strategy to enhance the inhibitory effects of the combination of EPA and P18 on melanoma proliferation and metastasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
