The whole plant of Persicaria capitata (Buch.-Ham. ex D. Don) H. Gross, namely Persicaria capitata herba, is a well-known ethnic herb with potent therapeutic effects on urinary tract infections and urinary calculus, yet previous reports have only focused on its effect on urinary tract infections.", "To evaluate the therapeutic potential of P. capitata herba against gout by investigating its antihyperuricemia and antigouty arthritis effects and possible mechanisms.", "The ethanol extract (EP) and water extract (WP) of P. capitata herba were prepared by extracting dried and ground whole plants of P. capitata with 75% ethanol and water, respectively, followed by removal of solvents and characterization by UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS. The antihyperuricemia and antigouty arthritis effects of the two extracts were evaluated in a potassium oxonate- and hypoxanthine-induced hyperuricemia mouse model and a monosodium urate crystal (MSUC)-induced acute gouty arthritis mouse model, respectively. The mechanisms were investigated by testing their effects on the expression of correlated proteins (by Western blot) and mRNAs (by RT-PCR).", "UHPLC-HRMS fingerprinting and two chemical markers (i.e., quercetin and quercitrin) determination were used for the characterization of the WP and EP extracts. Both WP and EP extracts showed pronounced antihyperuricemia activities, with a remarkable decline in serum uric acid and a marked increase in urine uric acid in hyperuricemic mice. Unlike the clinical xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitor allopurinol, WP and EP did not show any distinct renal toxicities. The underlying antihyperuricemia mechanism involves the inhibition of the activity and expression of XOD and the downregulation of the mRNA and protein expression of glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9) and urate transporter 1 (URAT1). The extracts of P. capitata herba also demonstrated remarkable anti-inflammatory activity in MSUC-induced acute gouty arthritis mice. The mechanism might involve inhibitory effects on the expression of proinflammatory factors.", "The extracts of P. capitata herba possessed pronounced antihyperuricemia and antigouty arthritis effects and were, therefore, promising natural medicines for hyperuricemia-related disorders and gouty arthritis. The use of P. capitata herba for the treatment of urinary calculus may be, at least to some degree, related to its potential as an antihyperuricemia and antigouty arthritis drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
