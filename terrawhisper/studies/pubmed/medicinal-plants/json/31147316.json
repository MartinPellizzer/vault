Nitidine chloride (NC) is a pharmacologically active alkaloid with polyaromatic hydrocarbon found in the roots of <i>Zanthoxylum nitidum</i> (Roxb.) DC, a traditional medicinal herb widely used in China. We examined the inhibitory effects of NC on CYP1A1, 1B1, and 1A2. NC significantly inhibited CYP1A1- and 1B1-catalyzed ethoxyresorufin <i>O</i>-deethylation activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.28 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 <i>\u03bc</i>M, respectively) in a concentration-dependent manner, but only showed slight inhibition of CYP1A2 activity (IC<sub>50</sub> > 50 <i>\u03bc</i>M). Kinetic analysis revealed that NC competitively inhibited CYP1B1 with a <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> value of 0.47 \u00b1 0.05 <i>\u03bc</i>M, whereas NC caused a mixed type of inhibition on CYP1A1 with <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> and <i>K</i> <sub>I</sub> values of 0.14 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.19 \u00b1 0.09 <i>\u03bc</i>M, respectively. The observed enzyme inhibition neither required NADPH nor revealed time dependency. Molecular docking manifested the generation of strong hydrogen-bonding interactions of Ser116 in CYP1A1 and Ser127 in CYP1B1 with methoxy moiety of NC. Additionally, NC-induced alteration of estradiol (E2) metabolism was also investigated in the present study. Hydroxyestradiols, including 2-hydroxyestradiol [(2-OHE2) nontoxic] and 4-hydroxyestradiol [(4-OHE2) genotoxic] generated in recombinant enzyme incubation systems and cultured MCF-7 cells were analyzed, and NC was found to preferentially inhibit the nontoxic 2-hydroxylation activity of E2 mediated by CYP1A1. In conclusion, NC was a mixed type inhibitor of CYP1A1 and a competitive inhibitor of CYP1B1. The remarkable inhibition on E2 2-hydroxylation might increase the risk of 4-OHE2-induced genotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CYP1 enzymes catalyze oxidative metabolism of a variety of compounds and are known to play a crucial role in the development of cancer. CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 are responsible for hydroxylation of estradiol (E2) at the C-2 position, resulting in the formation of 2-OHE2, which is proposed to be a detoxification pathway. However, CYP1B1-mediated hydroxylation of E2 at the C-4 position has been suggested to be a tumor initiator. The present study found that nitidine chloride is a mixed type inhibitor of CYP1A1 and a competitive inhibitor of CYP1B1. NC preferentially inhibited the nontoxic E2 2-hydroxylation pathway mediated by CYP1A1, which might increase the risk of 4-OHE2-induced genotoxicity and cause severe drug-drug interactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation (X.M., Q.W., L.Y., Y.L., H.L., Y.P., J.Z.) and School of Pharmaceutical Engineering (J.W.), Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, People's Republic of China;
