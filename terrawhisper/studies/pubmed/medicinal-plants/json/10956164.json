Wheat, paddy rice, polished rice, mungbean, and safflower were exposed to a 60 mg L(-)(1) of (14)COS for 7 days and then aired for 5 days. Carbonyl sulfide and/or alteration products in sugars, protein, starch, amino acids, protopectines, and hemicelluloses were undetectable. The total uptakes of radioactivity determined after fractionation and also by extraction were in the range of 36-53 ng g(-)(1) COS equiv. The total radioactivity determined by autoradiography was below the detection limit of 70 ng g(-)(1) COS equiv. Radioactivity in the commodities was less than 0.003% of all the radioactivity applied. The amount of retained radiolabel was measured in three ways. First, biochemical fractions such as lipids and amino acids were separated by chromatography, and the activity was determined in each component. Second, commodities were crushed and extracted in aqueous acetone until the maximum amount of radiolabel was extracted. Third, autoradiography was carried out on commodity kernels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Entomology, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Annis", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Y L", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Desmarchelier", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Oxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "871UI0ET21", "NameOfSubstance": "carbonyl sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Oxides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10956164", "10.1021/jf9908805", "jf9908805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
