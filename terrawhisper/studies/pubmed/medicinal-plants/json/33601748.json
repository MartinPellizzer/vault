Castor oil is a vegetable oil derived from the seeds of castor bean and is widely used as an industrial lubricant and medicinal purgative. In search of an alternative natural insecticide, the objective of this study was to evaluate the larvicidal and adulticidal activities of castor oil against the important dengue vector, Ae. aegypti. Larvicidal and adulticidal bioassays were conducted following the World Health Organization methods. Larvicidal activity was observed at castor oil concentrations of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 ppm; larval mortality was checked after 48 h of exposure and the lethal concentration (LC) at LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> were 51.38 and 116.26 ppm, respectively. Adulticidal activity was determined by topical application at the concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 \u00b5g/ mg on female mosquitoes and the mortality was checked after 24 h of exposure. The effective adulticidal activity was apparent with the LD<sub>50</sub> and LD<sub>90</sub> values of 6.03 and 25.07 \u00b5g/mg against female mosquitoes. The results indicated that castor oil has potential in the practical control of both immature and adult stages of the mosquito vector."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wamaket", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biodiversity and Environmental Conservation, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak 94300, Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Dieng", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Komalamisra", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Apiwathnasorn", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Morales", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok 10100, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Thanomsub", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Srisawat", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, 420/6 Ratchawithi Road, Ratchathewi, Bangkok 10400, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Attrapadung", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Trop Biomed", "NlmUniqueID": "8507086", "ISSNLinking": "0127-5720"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33601748"]}}]}
