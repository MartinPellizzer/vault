Nowadays, scanning electron microscope (SEM) is widely used to provide high-resolution images at the surface of biological samples. However, biological specimens require preparation, including dehydration and coating with conductive materials for imaging by SEM. There are several techniques for providing images with maximum maintenance of cell structure and minimum cellular damage, but each requires the use of expensive and hazardous materials, which can be damaging to the cell in many cases. Therefore, the provision of new and effective preparation methods based on maintaining cell structure for imaging can be very practical. In the present study, a fast and cost-effective protocol was first performed for chemical fixation and preparation of the plant cells for imaging by SEM. Taxus baccata and Zhumeria majdae cells were chemically fixed using glutaraldehyde and then successfully dried with different percentages of ethanol including 70, 80, 90, and 100%. In addition, SEM was performed for imaging the cell surface in different micro-scales. This protocol can be used by plant cell biologists and biotechnologists who are interested in studying structural and biochemical responses of treated or stressed plant cells by SEM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
