Unlike ubiquitous tocopherols, tocotrienols predominantly accumulate in the endosperm of monocot grains, catalyzed by homogentiate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT). Previously, we generated a tocotrienol-deficient <i>hvhggt</i> mutant with shrunken barley grains. However, the relationship between tocotrienols and grain development remains unclear. Here, we found that the <i>hvhggt</i> lines displayed hollow endosperms with defective transfer cells and reduced aleurone layers. The carbohydrate and starch contents of the <i>hvhggt</i> endosperm decreased by approximately 20 and 23%, respectively. Weighted gene coexpression network analyses identified a critical gene module containing <i>HvHGGT</i>, which was strongly associated with the <i>hvhggt</i> mutation and enriched with gene functions in starch and sucrose metabolism. Metabolome measurements revealed an elevated soluble sugar content in the <i>hvhggt</i> endosperm, which was significantly associated with the identified gene modules. The <i>hvhggt</i> endosperm had significantly higher NAD(H) and NADP(H) contents and lower levels of ADPGlc (regulated by redox balance) than the wild-type, consistent with the absence of tocotrienols. Interestingly, exogenous \u03b1-tocotrienol spraying on developing <i>hvhggt</i> spikes partially rescued starch accumulation and endosperm defects. Our study supports a potential novel function of tocotrienols in grain starch accumulation and endosperm development in monocot crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
