Thus, we explored the effect of socioeconomic and legacy factors on plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity, and the motivations for growing and keeping certain species. We sampled a total of 300 households across a socioeconomic gradient in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe, in high-, medium- and low-density areas, representing low to high wealth strata. Trees were mostly grown for ornamental purpose in the rich (low-density) suburbs and utilitarian purposes in the poorer medium to high-density areas. However, trees were also grown with similar proportion for shade across the socioeconomic gradient. Proportion of medicinal and fruit trees increased with household density, while wind break trees were more common in low-density suburbs. Exotic species exhibited greater species richness compared with indigenous species, with both combined and separate assessments of indigenous and exotic species richness revealing a significant positive association with socioeconomic and legacy factors. The composition of species displayed considerable variation along the socioeconomic gradient. Notably, in low-density environments, exotic species maintained elevated phylogenetic diversity in comparison to indigenous species. This distinction was particularly pronounced when analysed independently, revealing a significant positive correlation between exotic species richness and both property value and education level. Our study shows that residents filter specific plant species based on their socioeconomic status and that, relative to low-income households, the rich homeowners have unintentionally incorporated enough exotic species to produce novel phylogenetic diversity of woody plants in their yards. Thus, we confirm the existence of a socioeconomic gradient in terms of species richness, composition, and phylogenetic diversity. However, the imbalance in species richness and phylogenetic diversity across the socioeconomic gradient can be reduced by increased tree planting in open areas, including along streets in medium to high-density areas to improve ecosystem services."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
