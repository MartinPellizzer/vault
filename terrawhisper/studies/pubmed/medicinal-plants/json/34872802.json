The primary concern with diabetes is developing various complications, which significantly contribute to the disease's mortality and morbidity. Over time, the condition progresses from the pre-diabetic to the diabetic stage and then to the development of complications. Years and enormous resources are required to evaluate pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression of disease or complications in humans. Appropriate screening models are required to gain a better understanding of both pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents. Different species of animals are used to evaluate the pharmacological potentials and study the pathogenesis of the disease. Animal models are essential for research because they represent most of the structural, functional, and biochemical characteristics of human diseases. An ideal screening model should mimic the pathogenesis of the disease with identifiable characteristics. A thorough understanding of animal models is required for the experimental design to select an appropriate model. Each animal model has certain advantages and limitations. The present manuscript describes the animal models and their diagnostic characteristics to evaluate microvascular diabetic complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
