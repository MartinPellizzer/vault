Previous studies from our lab have shown that Bacopa monniera (BM), and Panax quniquefolium (PQ) have significant adaptogenic properties. Hence, we have further confirmed their activity in stress related disorders like anxiety and depression in animal model, rodents and assessed their efficacy. In our experimental protocol, gross behaviour was observed through Digiscan animal activity monitor. Anxiety was studied through light dark test, elevated plus maze test and holeboard test. Depression experiments were conducted following tail suspension test and forced swim test. Further, rotarod test was also used to study any defects in motor in-coordination in mice. It was observed that BM at the dose of 80 mg/kg (po) and PQ at 100 mg/kg (po) were effective as an anti-anxiety as well anti-depressant activity and had no motor in-coordination in mice. Hence, these extracts can be used as a potent therapeutic agent in treating mixed anxiety-depressive disorder (MAD)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology, Central Drug Research Institute, CSIR, Lucknow 226 001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "Manavi", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Pinki", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palit", "ForeName": "Gautam", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swimming"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21046986"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
