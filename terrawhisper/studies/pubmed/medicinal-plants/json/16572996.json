The seed germination was largely prohibited when the temperature is higher than 20 degrees C. The mildew rate was very high under 25, 20, 15, 10 degrees C. Put the seeds under 5 degrees C for 45 days could quickly break off its dormancy, and its mildew rate was lower. The seeds germinate fastest under the condition of 15-10 degrees C on the paper bed, and its germination rate was the highest.", "The morphological post-maturation seems the major dormancy mechanism of C. smyrnioides. Temperature is a major factor that affect seed germination of C. smymioides. The best pretreatment method is to put the seeds into 5 degrees C of wettish sand for 45 days. The best germination bed is the paper bed, and the best germination temperature is 15-10 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan-Sen", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16572996"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
