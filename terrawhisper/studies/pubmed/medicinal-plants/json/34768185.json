However, it is time-consuming and challenging to study these enzymes and only a small percentage of them have been well-characterized. Here, we report a rapid method to screen plant glycosyltransferases using a linear DNA expression template (LET) based cell-free transcription-translation system (TX-TL). As a proof of concept, we amplified and tested glycosyltransferases from Arabidopsis thaliana and showed that the catalytic activity results of these glycosyltransferases from LET-based-TX-TL were consistent with previous studies. We then chose a local medicinal plant Anoectochilus roxburghii, acquired its transcriptome sequences, and applied this method to study its glycosyltransferases. We rapidly expressed all the putative UDP-glucose glycosyltransferases using LET-based-TX-TL and discovered 6 unreported active glycosyltransferases which can catalyze the glycosylation of quercetin into isoquercitrin. Thus, LET-based-TX-TL was shown to be a powerful tool for researchers to rapidly screen plant glycosyltransferases for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
