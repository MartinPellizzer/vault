Essential oil from Fructus Alpiniae zerumbet (Pers.) B.L.Burtt & R.M.Sm. (EOFAZ) has potentially beneficial and promising diabetes-related vascular endothelial cell senescence-mitigating effects; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.", "To investigate the molecular effects of EOFAZ on vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes.", "A diabetes mouse model was developed using a high-fat and high-glucose diet (HFD) combined with intraperitoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ, 30\u00a0mg/kg) and oral treatment with EOFAZ. 4D label-free quantitative proteomics, network pharmacology, and molecular docking techniques were employed to explore the molecular mechanisms via which EOFAZ alleviates diabetes-related vascular endothelial cell senescence. A human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) senescence model was developed using high palmitic acid and high glucose (PA/HG) concentrations in vitro. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, SA-\u03b2-galactosidase staining, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell migration, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays were performed to determine the protective role of EOFAZ against vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes. Moreover, the PPAR-\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone, inhibitor GW9662, and siRNA were used to verify the underlying mechanism by which EOFAZ combats vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes.", "EOFAZ treatment ameliorated abnormal lipid metabolism, vascular histopathological damage, and vascular endothelial aging in diabetic mice. Proteomics and network pharmacology analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and drug-disease targets were associated with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) signalling pathway, a key player in vascular endothelial cell senescence. Molecular docking indicated that the small-molecule compounds in EOFAZ had a high affinity for the PPAR-\u03b3 protein. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses confirmed the significance of DEPs and the involvement of the PPAR-\u03b3 signalling pathway. In vitro, EOFAZ and rosiglitazone treatment reversed the effects of PA/HG on the number of senescent endothelial cells, expression of senescence-related proteins, the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase, ROS levels, cell migration rate, and expression of pro-inflammatory factors. The protective effects of EOFAZ against vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes were aborted following treatment with GW9662 or PPAR-\u03b3 siRNA.", "EOFAZ ameliorates vascular endothelial cell senescence in diabetes by activating PPAR-\u03b3 signalling. The results of the present study highlight the potential beneficial and promising therapeutic effects of EOFAZ and provide a basis for its clinical application in diabetes-related vascular endothelial cell senescence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
