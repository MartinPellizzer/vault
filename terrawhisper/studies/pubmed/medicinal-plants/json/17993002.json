The correlation and mathematical model were figured out between Chinese medicinal characteristics including biological classification, different tastes, channel tropism as well as the parts used and immunoregulatory activity based on the statistical software SPSS.", "The results showed that the immunoregulatory activity was related to the five tastes of Chinese medicines, and the pungent medicines had less immune effect. The Chinese medicines of underground parts had more immune effect compared with other parts of the medicine. Medicines acting upon heart and kidneys were more powerful as for the immune effects (P <0.05). The coincidence was 74.7% between mathematical computing and original classification.", "There are correlations,between Chinese medicinal characteristics and immunoregulatory activity.
