However, buccal mucosa delivery systems still face challenges of long-term mucosal adhesion, sustained drug release, and mucosal drug penetration. To address these issues, a double-layer film consisting of a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/polyacrylic acid interpolymer complex (IPC)-formulated mucoadhesive layer and an ethylcellulose (EC)-formulated waterproof backing layer (IPC/EC film) was designed. Protamine (PTM) and INS were co-loaded in the mucoadhesive layer of the IPC/EC film (PTM-INS-IPC/EC film). In ex vivo studies with porcine buccal mucosa, this film exhibited robust adhesion, with an adhesion force of 120.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f20.3\u202fN/m<sup>2</sup> and an adhesion duration of 491\u202f\u00b1\u202f45\u202fmin. PTM has been shown to facilitate INS mucosal transfer. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the PTM-INS-IPC/EC film significantly improved the absorption of INS, exhibiting a 1.45 and 2.24-fold increase in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC<sub>0-\u221e</sub>) compared to the INS-IPC/EC film and free INS, respectively. Moreover, the PTM-INS-IPC/EC film effectively stabilized the blood glucose levels of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T<sub>1</sub>DM) rats with post oral glucose administration, maintaining lower glucose levels for approximately 8\u202fh. Hence, the PTM-INS-IPC/EC film provides a promising noninvasive INS delivery system for diabetes treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
