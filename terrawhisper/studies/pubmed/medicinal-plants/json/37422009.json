Plant secondary metabolites can be used as lead compounds of drugs. Corynanthe alkaloids are highly abundant natural bioactive substances of various core structures possessing important properties such as nerve excitation and antimalarial and analgesic effects. In this review, we summarize and review the state-of-the-art corynanthe-type alkaloid research focusing on phytochemistry, pharmacology, and structural chemistry. Approximately 120 articles reporting 231 alkaloids classified into simple corynanthe, yohimbine, oxindole corynanthe, mavacurane, sarpagine, akuammiline, strychnos, and ajmaline-type groups were compiled. Relevant biological properties discussed include antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, muscle-relaxant, vasorelaxant, and analgesic activities and activities affecting the main nervous and cardiac systems, as well as NF-\u03baB inhibitory and Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter inhibitory properties. This review provides insights and a reference for future studies, thus paving the way for the discovery of drugs based on corynanthe alkaloids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
