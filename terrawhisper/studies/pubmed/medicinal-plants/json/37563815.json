Capparis spinosa (C. spinosa) is identified as a potential source of nutrition for alleviating various ailments. The current study assessed the ameliorating properties of C. spinosa hydroethanolic extract on memory dysfunction and the possible roles of oxidative stress and BDNF in the scopolamine (Scop)-treated rats.", "Forty male Wistar rats were divided into the following four groups: Control, Scop (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)), Scop + C. spinosa 150, and Scop + C. spinosa 300 groups. The rats were given C. spinosa extract (150 or 300 mg/kg, oral) for 3 weeks. During the third week, Passive Avoidance (PA) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests were done to assess memory and learning performance. Finally, oxidative stress markers and BDNF in the brain tissue were evaluated.", "Scop injection was associated with a significant increase in the time latency and travelled distance to reach the platform during the learning phase of MWM In the probe test, the Scoptreated rats showed a lower time and distance in the target area. Furthermore, Scop injection significantly decreased the latency to enter the dark while increasing the dark time and the frequency of entries to the dark zone of the PA task. C. spinosa extract effectively reversed the behavioural changes induced by Scop. Treatment with the extract also significantly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, thiols, and BDNF, while decreasing malondialdehyde production in the brains of the Scop-injured rats.", "C. spinosa hydroethanolic extract successfully ameliorated Scop-induced memory impairment by modifying BDNF and oxidative stress markers in the brain of amnesic rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouritorghabeh", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahidpour", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101269163", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5249"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capparis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37563815", "10.2174/1871524923666230719121439", "CNSAMC-EPUB-133008"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
