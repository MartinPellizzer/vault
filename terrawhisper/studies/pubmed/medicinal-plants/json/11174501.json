Perinatal outcomes, growth, and physical milestones of the offspring were compared in a blinded manner. Variables were compared by analysis of variance or by chi2 testing.", "The gestational ages at delivery and litter sizes did not differ between the hypericum-exposed and the placebo-exposed offspring. The body weight, body length, and head circumference measurements from postnatal day 3 through adulthood increased in a manner that was indistinguishable between the two groups of offspring, regardless of gender. No differences in reaching physical milestones (teeth eruptions, eye opening, external genitalia) were noted between the 2 groups. The reproductive capability, perinatal outcomes, and growth and development of the second-generation offspring were unaffected by hypericum exposure.", "Maternal administration of hypericum before and throughout gestation did not affect long-term growth and physical maturation of exposed mouse offspring."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rayburn", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christensen", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stewart", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370476", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cephalometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Genitalia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gestational Age"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Eruption"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11174501", "10.1067/mob.2001.108339", "S0002-9378(01)58758-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
