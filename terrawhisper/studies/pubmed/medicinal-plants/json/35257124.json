This study aims to discover one or more efficacious inhibitors against a BSH produced by <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> (lsBSH) from natural products and to characterize the mechanism of the newly identified BSH inhibitor(s). Following screening of the inhibition potentials of more than 100 natural compounds against lsBSH, amentoflavone (AMF), a naturally occurring biflavone isolated from various medicinal plants, was discovered to be an efficacious BSH inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.34 \u03bcM). Further investigation showed that AMF could strongly inhibit the lsBSH-catalyzed hydrolytic reaction in living gut microbes. Inhibition kinetic analyses demonstrated that AMF reversibly inhibited the lsBSH-catalyzed hydrolytic reaction in a mixed-inhibition manner, with an apparent <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> value of 0.65 \u03bcM. Fluorescence quenching assays suggested that AMF could quench the fluorescence of lsBSH <i>via</i> a static quenching procedure. Docking simulations suggested that AMF could be fitted into lsBSH at two distinct ligand-binding sites, mainly <i>via</i> hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, which explained well the mixed inhibition mode of this agent. Animal tests showed that the hydrolytic activities of BSHs in mice feces could be significantly blocked by AMF. In summary, this study reports that AMF is a strong, naturally occurring inhibitor of lsBSH, which offers a promising lead compound to develop novel agents for modulating bile acid metabolism in the host <i>via</i> targeting BSHs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Frontiers Science Center of TCM Chemical Biology, Institute of
