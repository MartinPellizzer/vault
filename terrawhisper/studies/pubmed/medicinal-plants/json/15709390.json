Aristolochic Acid I (AA-I) was used as a positive control. Cell toxicity of AL-I was detected by LDH releasing rate. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by cellular morphology, DNA content and expression of cell membrane phosphatidylserine (PS). The secretion level of fibronectin (FN) and TGF-beta1 in HK-2 cells were assayed by ELISA.", "AL-I had a direct toxicity on HK-2 in a dose dependent manner from 2.5 mg x mL(-1) to 20 mg x mL(-1); In these range of concentration, AL-I could induce cell apoptosis which was detectable by measurements of morphology, DNA content and expression of PS. AL-I could stimulate the secretion of FN and TGF-beta1. The potency of AL-I cell toxicity was higher than AA-I at the same concentration. The effects of AL-I on apoptosis, secretion of FN and TGF-beta1 were all weaker than AA-I.", "AL-I as one metabolite of AA-I in vivo induces direct injury in renal proximal tubular cells. Its effects are similar to those of AA-I. AL-I may be one of toxic metabolites in Chinese herbs containing AA which participate in renal damage and fibrosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Renal Division, Department of Medicine, First Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100034, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Biao", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cui-ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Shao-qing", "Initials": "SQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "13395-02-3", "NameOfSubstance": "aristolactam I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94218WFP5T", "NameOfSubstance": "aristolochic acid I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aristolochia"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diploidy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Tubules, Proximal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15709390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
