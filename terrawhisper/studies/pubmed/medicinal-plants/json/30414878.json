Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic analyses or comparison with literature data. The absolute configuration of 2 was assigned via X-ray crystallography. Compound 1 with a spiroketal moiety is relatively unusual in withanolides. Aromatic glycosides (8-10) showed potent inhibitory activity against LPS-induced nitric oxide production in RAW 264.7 macrophages, with IC<sub>50</sub> values from 4.69 to 16.12\u202f\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
