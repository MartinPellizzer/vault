Cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated against two cancer cell lines: human amelanotic melanoma (C32) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) by the SRB assay. Anthelmintic and anticancer activities were evaluated by the inhibiting concentration at 50% death (IC(50)) and the selectivity index (SI) relative to human fibroblasts.", "None of the extracts were active against Paramphistomum epiclitum. Plumbagin, a pure compound from Plumbago indica, had the strongest activity against Caenorhabditis elegans. The methylene chloride extract of Piper chaba fruits had the strongest activity against schistosome cercariae. Strong cytotoxicity was shown by the methylene chloride extract of Michelia champaca bark and the methanol extract of Curcuma longa rhizome against C32 and HeLa, respectively. These extracts had higher SI (>100) than positive controls in relation to either the worms or the cell lines. The methanol extract of Bouea burmanica had a slightly lower activity towards C32 cells than did Michelia champaca but had a much higher SI (>27,000).", "The plant species screened in this research was recorded by several indigenous medicinal practitioners as antiparasitic, anticancer and/or related activities to the human major organ system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atjanasuppat", "ForeName": "Korakot", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wongkham", "ForeName": "Weerah", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meepowpan", "ForeName": "Puttinan", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kittakoop", "ForeName": "Prasat", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sobhon", "ForeName": "Prasert", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bartlett", "ForeName": "Ann", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Whitfield", "ForeName": "Phil J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthelmintics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anthelmintics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Paramphistomatidae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosoma mansoni"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19473794", "10.1016/j.jep.2009.03.010", "S0378-8741(09)00150-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
