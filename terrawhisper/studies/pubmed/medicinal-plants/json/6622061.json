The experimentally infected mice were given a single oral dose of 10-1000 mg of Ma-Klua extract or flubendazole/kg body wt 1, 2, 3, 4, or 12 days post-infection and autopsied 14 days post-infection. Ma-Klua extract was effective in the elimination of adults (ED50 = 79 mg/kg) but not larvae. Drastic effects of Ma-Klua extract on the motility and structure of adults were observed and the number of the adults in mice decreased with time after administration of the drug 12 days post-infection. The small numbers of adults remaining in the host intestine 2 days after the drug administration showed severe damage in the gravid segments. These facts were thought to be responsible for the significant reduction in egg output observed 1 and 2 days after medication. Fresh eggs exposed to Ma-Klua extract in vitro and in vivo, or in vivo alone showed reduced infectivity. The effect of flubendazole on adults and larvae was minimal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maki", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kondo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yanagisawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Parasitology", "NlmUniqueID": "0401121", "ISSNLinking": "0031-1820"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "81G6I5V05I", "NameOfSubstance": "Mebendazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R8M46911LR", "NameOfSubstance": "flubendazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Hymenolepiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hymenolepis"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mebendazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6622061", "10.1017/s0031182000052458"]}}]}
