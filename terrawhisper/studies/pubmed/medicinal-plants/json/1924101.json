Hens were randomly assigned to two treatments: those injected with urease and controls injected only with adjuvant. At 22 wk of age, half of the SCWL hens were injected intramuscularly with 12 Sumner units of jackbean urease suspended in incomplete adjuvant six times in 26 wk. Turkey hens were injected twice at weekly intervals with 70 Sumner units. The other half of the breeders received adjuvant without urease (control). Urease injection into SCWL hens had no effect on feed consumption, feed conversion, and percentage fertility, hatchability, and hatch of all eggs set, but egg weight and body weight of chicks at hatch and at 3 wk of age were significantly higher as compared with the control hens. In the case of turkey hens, percentage hatchability and progeny body weight were significantly higher as a result of urease injection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706."}], "LastName": "Pimentel", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cook", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jonsson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intramuscular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Turkeys"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1924101", "10.3382/ps.0701842", "S0032-5791(19)33310-3"]}}]}
