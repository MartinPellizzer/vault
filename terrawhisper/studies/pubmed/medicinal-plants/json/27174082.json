Thirty-five (22%) are new medicinal plant records in Morocco, and 26 described as used for the first time anywhere. Fidelity levels (FL) revealed low specificity in plant use, particularly for the most commonly reported plants. Most plants are used in mixtures. Plant use is driven by local concepts of disease, including \"hot\" and \"cold\" classification and beliefs in supernatural forces.", "Local medicinal plant knowledge is rich in the High Atlas, where local populations still rely on medicinal plants for healthcare.
