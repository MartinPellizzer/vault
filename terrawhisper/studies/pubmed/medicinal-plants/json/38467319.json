Y. Wu & S. J. Hsuan (CP) are both included in the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China (edition 2020) as the legitimate source of \"Duan Xue Liu\" (DXL), which is a crucial traditional Chinese medicine used as a clinical remedy for bleeding diseases. However, the differences in plant endogenous metabolites and bioactivities between CC and CP are still unclear.", "This study aims to provide a scientific basis to investigate the differences between CC and CP ensuring the efficient and safe use of DXL.", "A multidimensional strategy including plant metabolomics, digital reference standard (DRS) analyzer, and biological activities assay was creatively constructed for the characterization, distinction, and quality control of CC and CP.", "There were apparent differences in the metabolites between CC and CP. 7 compounds contributing to the differences were successfully identified. On that basis, linear calibration using two reference substances (LCTRS) methods was proved as a more accurate and specific quality analysis method for CC and CP. In addition, bioactivity assays showed that both CC and CP exhibited obvious hemostatic activity, while CC showed greater potential to resist inflammation and free radicals.", "In summary, it was the first time to investigate the chemical constituents and bioactivities differences between CC and CP with the help of plant metabolomics, DRS study, and biological activity assays. These two plants were significantly separated in the integrated analysis, suggesting that we should pay attention to the distinction to prevent unexpected risks caused by medicinal materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
