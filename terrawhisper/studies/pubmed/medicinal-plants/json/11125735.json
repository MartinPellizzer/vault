Exposure to garlic odour resulted in substantial and widespread increases in c-Fos expression in the olfactory bulbs of all animals. However, although conditioned pups showed a specific behavioural response to the learned garlic odour, neither the amount nor pattern of c-Fos expression differed compared to pups exposed to garlic as a novel odour. The odour-induced expression of c-Fos was not well localised, although there was a significant increase in the number of granule cells expressing c-Fos in the ventrolateral region of the bulb. These results support previous reports that the response to odours in the olfactory bulb of new-born animals is not as spatially distinct as that in adults. Nevertheless, the immature olfactory system of these young animals is clearly capable of very specific odour learning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Psychologie, University of Munich, M\u00fcnchen, Germany. karl@imp.med.uni-muenchen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Allingham", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brennan", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Distel", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hudson", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Behav Brain Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8004872", "ISSNLinking": "0166-4328"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Suckling"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Conditioning, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Olfactory Bulb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stimulation, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11125735", "10.1016/s0166-4328(99)00061-3", "S0166-4328(99)00061-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
