The synthesis of AuNPs was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer and structure by a high resolution atomic force microscope. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy was used to study the crystallite size and different functional groups. DPPH radical scavenging activity and disc diffusion protocol was applied for the determination of antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. A ratio of 1:8 of 1mM AuCl<sub>3</sub> solutions with plant boiled extract used for synthesis of gold nano-particles. The formation of the gold nano-particles was determined by the color change from yellow to dark purple which were confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Gold nano-particles were stable between 24\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C, mM concentration of the salt and neutral pH. The groups responsible for the synthesis of gold nano-paricles were Alkenes and aliphatic amines. The AuNP were cubic in nature and the nanocrystallite size was 6.99nm. Gold nano-particles revealed good antioxidant activity and controlled the growth of K. pnemoniae, E. coli, X. compestris, C. albicans and P. chrysogenum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, The University of Agriculture Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Rafi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, The University of Agriculture Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bakht", "ForeName": "Jehan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, University of Karachi."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Muhammad Raza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shafi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Periploca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthomonas campestris"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31278722"]}}]}
