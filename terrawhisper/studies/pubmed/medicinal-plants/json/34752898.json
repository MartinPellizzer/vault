However, very few disease-specific surveys and their pharmacological validation have been published. The present study aimed to identify, document, and pharmacologically validate the tribal knowledge on anti-inflammatory medicinal plants.", "The field survey was conducted over a year from July 2015 to June 2016, scattered in the South-Western region of Satpuda Ranges. Documentation and identification of the medicinal herbs used often in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Two plants, namely Eulophia herbacea Lindl., and Grewia flavescens A. Juss. were commonly used for inflammatory conditions. Phytopharmacological validation was done using carrageenan induced inflammation and CFA-induced arthritis.", "The current investigation identified 32 plants from 22 different families as anti-inflammatory plants. G. flavescens exhibited substantial antiarthritic action in complete Freund's adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats, and E. herbacea showed powerful anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model. This activity might be attributed to the presence of gallic acid, quercetin, \u03b2-sitosterol and lupeol.", "The research reveals that selected plants had anti-inflammatory properties in both acute and chronic inflammation. Further studies to highlight the exact mechanism of action of these plants are warranted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
