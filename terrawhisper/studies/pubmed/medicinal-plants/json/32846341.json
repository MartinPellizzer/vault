In this study, an integrated data filtering and identification strategy was developed to efficiently identify the chemical constituents in Arnebiae Radix. The post-acquisition data processing steps with this strategy were as follows: (1) data acquisition by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS); (2) background subtraction on the basis of the total ion chromatogram (TIC) to obtain the background-subtracted ion chromatogram; (3) construction of a diagnostic ion database based on the measured MS/MS fragment ions of reference standards and auxiliary diagnostic information according to literatures; (4) mass defect filtering (MDF) to filter the background-subtracted ion chromatogram; and (5) rapid structural identification in the MDF-processed ion chromatogram on the basis of the diagnostic ion database and further structural confirmation by analysing the retention time, fragment behaviour, and online databases (Chemspider, PubChem, and SciFinder). In this study, the herbal medicine Arnebiae Radix was used to illustrate this strategy. A total of 96 compounds were efficiently exposed and characterized from Arnebiae Radix samples obtained from 20 sources, and 13 of these compounds were confirmed by comparison with the reference standards. Thirty components with a low abundance, that remained undetected in the TIC, were identified in the MDF-processed ion chromatogram. Nine of these compounds had not been identified from Arnebiae Radix previously, and were tentatively screened as unknowns. The chemical components in traditional Chinese medicine preparations are considered to be the material basis for the effectiveness of this medical system, and are closely related to the pharmacological activities of the drugs. The pharmacodynamics of these drugs are known to be influenced by the synergistic effects of various components. Therefore, comprehensive profiling of the chemical compositions of herbal extracts is essential for systematic elucidation of the pharmacodynamics of these medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
