The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical benefits of a new oral formulation of Ifanosine.", "In vitro studies using an isometric transducer examined the antihypertensive effects of HT, OEL, and Ifanosine on rat aorta. Ussing chambers technic were employed to measure mucosal to serosal fluxes and total transepithelial electrical conductance (Gt) to assess the intestinal bioavailability of HT, OEL, and Ifanosine. HPLC was utilized to determine the phytochemical composition of OEL and HT extracts. Subchronic toxicity investigations involved two groups of rats, treated with either water (control) or Ifanosine at 5 g/kg for 28 days. Clinical benefits of the new Ifanosine formulation were evaluated in an observational study with 32 hypertensive patients receiving a fixed oral dose of 3.5 mg three times a day for 30 days.", "Aqueous extracts induced dose-dependent relaxation of rat aorta rings, with HT and OEL having higher IC50 values than Ifanosine (IC50 = 44.76 \u00b1 1.35 ng/mL, 58.67 \u00b1 1.02 ng/mL, and 29.46 \u00b1 0.26 ng/mL, respectively). The pA2 values of OEL and HT were 1 and 0.6, respectively, while Ifanosine was 0.06. Intestinal bioavailability studies revealed better Prazosin bioavailability than plant extracts. Toxicological studies demonstrated the safety of Ifanosine, supported by histological examinations and biochemical parameters in rat blood. Biochemical analyses indicated flavonoids and phenolic acids as dominant active constituents. Clinical benefits in humans included reduced SBP, DBP, LDL-c, VLDL-c, and TAG, and increased HDL-c without overt adverse effects.", "This study validates the traditional use of OEL and HT for hypertension and advocates for alternative and combinatorial polyphytotherapy (ACP) to enhance traditional remedies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
