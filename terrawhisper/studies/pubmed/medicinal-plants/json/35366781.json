Wounds can be acute or chronic type, also diabetic, trauma, accidental, burn wounds and minor cuts, bruises, and rashes, etc. One of the primary treatment options available in these conditions are the use of suitable dressing materials to cover the wound and accelerate the healing process. Since ancient times, according to archaeological theories, medicinal plants and oils have been employed for the treatment of wounds. Today researchers across the globe are focusing their efforts on fabrication of novel dressing materials that can provide the most effective treatment, easy exchange of nutrients, and absorb exudate from the wounds. Very lately, various research groups are also concentrating on the design and development of herb-loaded wound dressings, as herbal preparations contain numerous phytoconstituents with a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties when compared to synthetic drugs and also due to the perceived notion that herbal products are generally safe, even when administered over prolonged periods. They contain numerous bioactive that can act on the various phases of the wound healing process, providing an ideal environment for the healing process. The present review discusses the numerous approaches that are employed for the preparation of dressing materials incorporated with plant-derived phytoconstituents/extracts. This review also provides an insight into the healing process and wound healing agents derived from medicinal plants and oils. The review can serve as a database for researchers working in this field and can help them to select the most appropriate dressing material for the effective delivery of herbal preparations in the management of wounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Dr. D.Y.
