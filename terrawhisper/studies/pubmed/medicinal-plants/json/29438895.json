These molecules are involved in a variety of roles in the life span of plants, ranging from structural ones to protection. Centella asiatica (L.) Urban has probably been used since prehistoric times and has been reported to have been used for various medicinal and cosmetic purposes. The plant contains several active constituents, of which the most important is asiaticoside, a triterpenoid. Asiaticoside content in C. asiatica can be enhanced by the use of biotic elicitors like Piriformospora indica. P. indica has been used as a model to study the mechanisms and evolution of mutualistic symbiosis. P. indica is similar to Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in terms of plant growth promotional effects. The autoclaved fraction from P. indica (PiCWE) was found to be the most active fraction in promoting the plant biomass and asiaticoside content. To date, there are no reports on the potential role of PiCWE in enhancement of asiaticoside over the control and P. indica colonized plants, which was evidenced by the differential expression of key genes involved and final asiaticoside content along with the determination of phytohormones. Moreover, differential expression of selected miRNAs in PiCWE - C. asiatica root interactions over the control and P. indica treated C. asiatica leaf samples was also scrutinized. The important consequence of induction with PiCWE was the significant enhancement of asiaticoside in the PiCWE induced plants in comparison with the asiaticoside content in control and P. indica-C. asiatica interaction. In addition, the role of miRNAs in C. asiatica - PiCWE would enable more in-depth studies for deciphering the molecular and physiological mechanisms of the association and regulation of PiCWE - C. asiatica interactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
