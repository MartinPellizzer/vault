This study aims at investigating the flavonoid accumulation in C. paliurus dependent on phosphate (Pi) availability and its potential association with internal carbon partitioning. One-year-old seedlings of C. paliurus were planted in four different Pi levels. Low Pi resulted in low phosphorus content within plants, while the nitrogen content increased. Further analysis revealed that the surplus carbon pool was greater and was allocated to N-metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis under low Pi conditions, as shown by the higher levels of free amino acids, starch, and soluble sugars. Low Pi availability also induced higher enzymatic activities of shikimate dehydrogenase (SDH) and flavonoid 3-hydoxylase (FHT), and higher flavonoid accumulation in leaves. Our results indicated that the surplus carbon induced by low-Pi levels can increase flavonoid synthesis in seedlings of C. paliurus. In addition, growth and biomass accumulation were increased by the elevated Pi levels. As a result, the highest flavonoid yield per plant was obtained under relative low Pi conditions. This study can provide the basis for developing new agricultural practices to maintain high yield while still keeping the quality of medicinal plants and crops."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mengjia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5672-306X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Forestry and Landscape Architecture, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31800528", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Juglandaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bao, J.S., Cai, Y., Sun, M., Wang, G.Y. & Corke, H.
