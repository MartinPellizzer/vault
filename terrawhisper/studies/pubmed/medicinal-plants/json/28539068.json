(Leguminosae), tamarind, includes treatment of human and livestock ailments; preparations are recognized antipyretics in fevers, laxatives and carminatives. African folklore has various applications of tamarind. However, in Nyasaland, domestic fowl are fed with preparations for prophylactic properties.", "The objective of this study is to evaluate the antiviral properties of T. indica extract.", "Tamarindus indica stem bark was extracted through ethanol maceration over 24\u2009h, and the crude extract was fractionated by gravity-propelled column chromatography. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) inhibitory activity of extract and fractions were evaluated in vivo using 10-d-old embryonated chicken egg (ECE) as the medium for virus cultivation and antivirus assay. About 240 ECE were grouped into eight (three controls and five experimental) and, 200\u2009\u03bcL of the extract and fractions respectively inoculated into NDV pre-infected eggs and incubated at 37\u2009\u00b0C. Allantoic fluid was harvested 5\u2009d post-virus infection and assayed for haemagglutination (HA).", "Anti-NDV assessment showed 62.5\u2009mg/mL of crude extract and fractions: TiA, TiC and TiD to yield a HA titre of 1:128 each, while TiB showed 1:64\u2009HA titre. At 125\u2009mg/mL, a titre of 1:16 was recorded against TiB and TiD and, 1:8 against TiA. Similarly, crude extract and TiC, each recorded 1:4\u2009HA titre. However, the minimum concentrations of extract and fraction for virus inactivation were 0.24\u2009mg/mL and 0.49\u2009mg/mL, respectively.", "The antiviral activity shown by T. indica portends novel antiviral drugs and, perhaps, as scaffold for new drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a SAMRC Microbial Water Quality Monitoring Centre , University of Fort Hare , Alice , South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry , University of Fort Hare , Alice , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Okoh", "ForeName": "Omobola O", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany , Delta State University , Abraka , Delta State , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Obiiyeke", "ForeName": "Grace E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a SAMRC Microbial Water Quality Monitoring Centre , University of Fort Hare , Alice , South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Applied and Environmental Microbiology Research Group (AEMREG), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology , University of Fort Hare , Alice , Eastern Cape , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Nwodo", "ForeName": "Uchechukwu U", "Initials": "UU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a SAMRC Microbial Water Quality Monitoring Centre , University of Fort Hare , Alice , South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Applied and Environmental Microbiology Research Group (AEMREG), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology , University of Fort Hare , Alice , Eastern Cape , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Okoh", "ForeName": "Anthony I", "Initials": "AI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle disease virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tamarindus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abdalla HI, Abugabal NS, Hassan AZ, El-Safty MM, Shalaby NMM.. 2012.
