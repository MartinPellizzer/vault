I.M. Johnst (Rubiaceae) is a traditional medicinal plant used in Sri Lanka for the treatment of bacterial infections. Due to its rich endophytic fungi content, it was postulated that endophytically-produced specialized metabolites may be responsible for its purported antibacterial effects. To test this hypothesis, eight pure endophytic fungal cultures were isolated from G. repens then extracted and screened for antibacterial activity in a disc diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Large scale culturing, extraction, and purification of the most active fungal extract, obtained from Xylaria feejeensis, led to the isolation of 6',7'-didehydrointegric acid (1), 13-carboxyintegric acid (2), and four known compounds including integric acid (3). Compound 3 was isolated as the key antibacterial component (MIC\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against Bacillus subtilis, 64\u00a0\u03bcg/mL against Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus). Compound 3 and its analogues were devoid of hemolytic activity up to the highest tested concentration of 45\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. This study demonstrates that specialized metabolites produced by endophytic fungi may contribute to the biological activity of some medicinal plants. Endophytic fungi should be evaluated as a potential source of antibiotics, especially from unexplored medicinal plants traditionally used for the treatment of bacterial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
