Vit C. The drugs were added to the drinking water of the dams and their pups during lactation period and then continued for the offspring through the \ufb01rst 8 weeks of their life. Finally, 7 male offspring from each group were randomly selected. <i>Results:</i> Thyroxine, protein and albumin concentrations in the serum and thiol content and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in renal and liver tissues of hypothyroid group was lower (all P<0.001) while, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P), creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations in the serum and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and renal tissues were higher than the control (all P<0.001). All doses of Vit C increased thyroxine, protein and albumin and thiol content in in renal and liver tissues while, decreased AST, ALT and ALK-P concentration and MDA in liver and renal tissues compared to PTU group (P<0.05-P<0.001). Creatinine, BUN and SOD and CAT were improved by both 100 and 500 mg/kg of Vit C in the renal (P<0.05-P<0.001) and by 100\u00a0mg/kg in the liver (P<0.05-P<0.001). <i>Conclusion:</i> Vit C improved liver and renal function of hypothyroid rats which might be due to its protective effects against tissues oxidative damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Esfarayen Faculty of Medical Sciences, Esfarayen, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeilizadeh", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alikhani", "ForeName": "Vajihe", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarzi", "ForeName": "Zakieh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Esfarayen Faculty of Medical Sciences, Esfarayen, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shoja", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansoorian", "ForeName": "Mozhgan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Vitam Nutr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "1273304", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothyroidism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30789800", "10.1024/0300-9831/a000495"]}}]}
