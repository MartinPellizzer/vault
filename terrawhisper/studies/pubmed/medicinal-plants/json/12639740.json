Saponins treated three dose groups of animals indicated significant decrease in RBC count during the experimental period of 16 days. This effect was more pronounced in animals treated with saponin-II than saponin-I. The 0.50 and 1.0g crude drug treated animals and 10 and 20mg of both the saponins treated animals, indicated a decreasing tendency of HC up to the 4th day, which increased afterwards up to the 16th day. The third dose of these materials (1.50g of crude drug and 30mg of both saponins) exhibited a highly significant decreasing pattern, up the 16 days. The decreasing effect of haemoglobin concentration was more distinct in the saponin-II treated animals than saponin-I and the crude drug. The MCH followed a reverse pattern than RBC and HC. A continued decreasing trend was found in total WBC during the 16 days treatment. An amount of 1.50g of the crude drug and 30mg of both the saponins had highly significant decreasing effects on the amount of total leukocyte count of rabbit's blood."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Allama Iqbal Campus, Lahore, 54000, Pakistan. moasif1605@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asif Saeed", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahid Sabir", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Indices"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zygophyllaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12639740", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00365-3", "S0378874102003653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
