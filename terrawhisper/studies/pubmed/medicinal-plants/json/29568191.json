The antioxidant activities of these fractions were carried out against 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals, and ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). <i>In vitro</i> antidiabetic experimentation was performed by evaluating the \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory capacity. The isolated polyphenols were then identified using liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy (LC/MS).", "Out of the eight polyphenolic fractions (BAL 1-8), BAL-4 has the highest inhibitory activity against ABTS radicals whereas BAL-6 showed potent ferric ion-reducing capacity. BAL-5 was the most effective fraction with antidiabetic activity with IC<sub>50</sub>of 140.0 and 68.58 \u00b1 3.2 \u03bcg/ml for \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities, respectively. All the fractions competitively inhibited \u03b1-amylase, BAL-5 and BAL-6 also inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase competitively, while BAL-4 and BAL-1 exhibited noncompetitive and near competitive inhibitions against \u03b1-glucosidase, respectively. The LC/MS analysis revealed the presence of carvone in all the fractions.", "The present study demonstrates the antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of the isolated polyphenols from <i>B. abyssinica</i>.", "Polyphenols were successfully isolated and identified from <i>Bulbine abyssinica</i> leavesThe isolated polyphenols are biologically active with high antioxidant as well as inhibitor of carbohydrate-digesting enzymes<i>B. abyssinica</i> can be a good source of amylase and glucosidase inhibitors<i>B. abyssinica</i> can be used as complementary or alternative therapeutic agents especially for the treatment of diabetesCarvone, quercetin, and psoralen could be the compounds responsible for the \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities. <b>Abbreviations Used:</b> ABTS: 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), DPPH: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, FRAP: Ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power, LC/MS: Liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy, AGEs: Advanced glycation end products, TLC: Thin-layer chromatography, MeOH: Methanol, PNP-G: \u03c1-Nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-Glucoside, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>: Coefficient of determination, mgQE: Milligram quercetin equivalent, mgTAE: Milligram tannic acid equivalent, mgCE: Milligram catechin equivalent, g: Gram."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Medicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Centre, University of Fort Hare, Eastern Cape, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Odeyemi", "ForeName": "Samuel Wale", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Medicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Centre, University of Fort Hare, Eastern Cape, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "Anthony Jiede", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mazid M, Khan T, Mohammad F.
