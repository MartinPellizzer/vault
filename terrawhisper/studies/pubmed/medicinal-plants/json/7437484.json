It was established that gradual formation of the alkaloid complex takes place in parallel with growth differentiation of the organs during seed germination and the formation of seedlings, which is due to the de novo biosynthesis (in a specific sequence) of alkaloids of various structural types: first 1,2,9,10-substituted aporphines, then protopines, and, finally 1,2,10,11-substituted aporphines, benzophenanthridine, as well as morphinans. It was found that glaucine predominates among the alkaloids of the seeds and in the above-ground organs of seedlings of different ages, while protopine predominates in the subsoil organs. The data obtained on the nature of the formation of the alkaloid complex suggest that the aporphines are the phylogenetically oldest compounds among alkaloids of other groups of this plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lovkova YaY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buzuk", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grinkevich", "ForeName": "N I", "Initials": "NI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Bull Acad Sci USSR", "NlmUniqueID": "7513560", "ISSNLinking": "0098-2164"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "embryology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7437484"]}}]}
