Rich.) Endl. (Burseraceae) is a medicinal plant widely used in Nigerian ethnomedicine. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the stem bark extract of C.\u00a0africana and isolated cytotoxic compounds was investigated. Three resveratrol derivatives: (E)-resveratrol 3-O-rutinoside (1), 5-methoxy-(E)-resveratrol 3-O-rutinoside (2), and pinostilbene (3), together with 3-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzoic acid (4) were isolated from the methanol fraction of C.\u00a0africana. Their structures were determined by extensive analysis of their HREIMS and NMR spectra. The cytotoxicity of the isolated compounds against four human carcinoma cells was determined using the MTT assay. Compound 1 displayed the highest antiproliferative effect on the cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 16.80, 21.74, 17.89, and 17.44\u00a0\u03bcM, against MCF7, A549, PC3, and HepG2 human cancer cell lines, respectively. In addition, compounds 1-3 showed low toxicity against normal human prostate cell line, with selectivity indices greater than five across the carcinoma cells, indicating that the compounds possess potential in the development of low-toxicity chemotherapeutic agents. These results support the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago Iwoye, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Segun", "ForeName": "Peter A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6487-9494"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ogbole", "ForeName": "Omonike O", "Initials": "OO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3595-6665"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK."}], "LastName": "Ismail", "ForeName": "Fyaz M D", "Initials": "FMD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK."}], "LastName": "Nahar", "ForeName": "Lutfun", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK."}], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Andrew R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ajaiyeoba", "ForeName": "Edith O", "Initials": "EO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4038-0514"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products Research Group, School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, UK."}], "LastName": "Sarker", "ForeName": "Satyajit D", "Initials": "SD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NGCN-2016-110", "Agency": "U.K. Department for International Development", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Commiphora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30346066", "10.1002/ptr.6209"]}}]}
