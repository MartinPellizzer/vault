In this paper, we successfully synthesized tumor neovascular-targeted Mn-Zn ferrite MNCs, which encapsulated paclitaxel (PTX) in a biocompatible PEG-phospholipid (DSPE-PEG2000) layer and surface, simultaneously coupled with a tripeptide of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD). The high-performance RGD-modified MNC loaded with PTX (MNCs-PTX@RGD) embodied excellent magnetic properties, including high-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and remarkable magnetically induced heat generation ability. We established the mouse model bearing subcutaneous 4T1 breast tumor, and demonstrated that MNCs-PTX@RGD could be effectively located in the tumor neovascular epithelial cells under the guidance of in vivo MRI. Notably, MNCs-PTX@RGD could easily penetrate into the tumor tissue from the tumor-fenestrated vascular networks for capturing a sufficient temperature (around 43 \u00b0C) exposed to an alternative current magnetic field (ACMF, 2.58 kA m<sup>-1</sup>, 390 kHz), leading to an effective TMH effect. Subsequently, the TMH-mediated temperature elevation accelerated the PTX release from the inner lipid layer, promoting the synergetic thermo-chemotherapy in vivo. The amplifying synergistic treatment strategy obviously improved the anti-tumor efficacy of MNCs-PTX@RGD, and simultaneously increased the survival time of the mice to more than 46 days, which provided a broad development prospect in clinical applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, P.
