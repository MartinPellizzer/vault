Two types of multivariate analyses were done based on the chemical composition of the investigated sample in this study and 12 other samples reported in the literature to show the chemodiversity in essential oil composition. Antimicrobial, acetylcholinesterase inhibitory and cytotoxic activities of the essential oil and its major component were assessed. Twenty-one compounds were identified, representing 96.81% of the total oil and the major constituent was 1,8-cineole (70.06%). Multivariate analyses revealed two chemotypes, i.e. nepetalactone and 1,8-cineole. The essential oil of the sample investigated in this study which was a 1,8-cineole chemotype and 1,8-cineole showed moderate antimicrobial activity and significantly inhibited the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Cytotoxicity evaluation against three breast cancer cell lines showed a potent inhibitory activity. Further investigations are necessary to confirm the variety in several populations of N. menthoides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0618-5937"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicinal Plants Research Centre, Department of Pharmacognosy , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahkeshani", "ForeName": "Niloofar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicinal Plants Research Centre, Department of Pharmacognosy , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadjiakhoondi", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Navidpour", "ForeName": "Latifeh", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Faculty of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Centre , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Akbarzadeh", "ForeName": "Tahmineh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Biotechnology , Iranian Research Organization for Science and Technology , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Safavi", "ForeName": "Malihe", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Persian Medicine and Pharmacy Research Centre , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimpour-Razkenari", "ForeName": "Elahe", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Pharmacy and Medicinal Plants Research Centre, Department of Pharmacognosy , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Faculty of Land and Food Systems , University of British Columbia , Vancouver , Canada."}], "LastName": "Khanavi", "ForeName": "Mahnaz", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentane Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21651-62-7", "NameOfSubstance": "nepetalactone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RV6J6604TK", "NameOfSubstance": "Eucalyptol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentane Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nepeta"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29034738", "10.1080/14786419.2017.1378202"]}}]}
