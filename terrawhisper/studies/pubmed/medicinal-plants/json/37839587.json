Their structures were elucidated based on the HRESIMS and NMR data analyses. The absolute configurations of millefoliumines A-Q were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, ECD data analysis along with quantum-chemical ECD calculations. The anti-inflammatory effects of these compounds on the LPS-induced RAW264.7\u00a0cell model were evaluated. As a result, millefoliumine G exhibited potential inhibitory effects on the release of NO, the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Above results indicated a potential of the guaianolides from A. millefolium in the anti-inflammatory drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
