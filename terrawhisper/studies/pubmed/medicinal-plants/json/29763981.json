Synergistic interactions between conventional antibiotics and natural bioactive may have therapeutic benefits in a clinical setting. There are plenty of medicinal plants that have proven efficacy against broad spectrum of micro-organisms. The aim of the work was to assess the antibacterial activity of Cladanthus arabicus, a Moroccan medicinal plant, and Bubonium imbricatum, a Moroccan endemic plant. The evaluation of the synergistic effect of extracted essential oils (EOs) together with some conventional antibiotics was also investigated. Checkerboard test was used to evaluate the interaction of EOs in combination with amoxicillin and neomycin. The results showed that EOs contain a potent activity against the tested Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with inhibition zones values in the range of 8\u00b705\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b71 and 13\u00b71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00\u00b711\u00a0mm and MIC values between 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> to 800\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> for C. arabicus and from 400\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> to 1600\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> for B. imbricatum, respectively. Moreover, the current study allowed concluding that both EOs showed not only satisfactory antibacterial properties but also active effects combined with conventional antibiotics demonstrated by the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index (FICI). These findings are very interesting since there are no previous studies on synergistic interactions of these two plants with antibiotics.", "The development of antibiotic resistance is multifactorial, including the specific nature of the relationship of bacteria to antibiotics. This situation has forced scientists to search for new antimicrobial substances from various sources as novel antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, medicinal plants and their derivatives (essential oils, extracts) have become very important in therapeutics because they encounter minimal challenges of the emergence of resistance. In this direction, the antimicrobial activity of the endemic Bubonium imbricatum plant and medicinal Cladanthus arabicus plant essential oils against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains was demonstrated."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorisation of Plant Resources (URAC35 Association Unit), Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Aghraz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory \"Animal Health and Production\", Higher National Veterinary School, Algiers, Algeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nursing Department, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Life, Abdelhamid Ibn Badis University, Mostaganem, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Benameur", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3866-4713"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gervasi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorisation of Plant Resources (URAC35 Association Unit), Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Ait Dra", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory \"Animal Health and Production\", Higher National Veterinary School, Algiers, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Ben-Mahdi", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorisation of Plant Resources (URAC35 Association Unit), Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Larhsini", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology, Protection and Valorisation of Plant Resources (URAC35 Association Unit), Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Cadi Ayyad University, Marrakesh, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Markouk", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical and Dental Sciences and Morphofunctional Imaging, University of Messina, Messina, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science4Life, Spin Off Company, University of Messina, Messina, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cicero", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "804826J2HU", "NameOfSubstance": "Amoxicillin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I16QD7X297", "NameOfSubstance": "Neomycin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amoxicillin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29763981", "10.1111/lam.13007"]}}]}
