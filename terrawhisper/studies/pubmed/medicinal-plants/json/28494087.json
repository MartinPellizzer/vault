As there are no specific treatments available, Chikungunya virus infection is a significant public health problem. This study investigated 120 extracts from selected medicinal plants for anti-Chikungunya virus activity. The plant materials were subjected to sequential solvent extraction to obtain six different extracts for each plant. The cytotoxicity and antiviral activity of each extract were examined using African monkey kidney epithelial (Vero) cells. The ethanol, methanol and chloroform extracts of Tradescantia spathacea (Commelinaceae) leaves showed the strongest cytopathic effect inhibition on Vero cells, resulting in cell viabilities of 92.6% \u00b1 1.0% (512 \u03bcg/ml), 91.5% \u00b1 1.7% (512 \u03bcg/ml) and 88.8% \u00b1 2.4% (80 \u03bcg/ml) respectively. However, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the chloroform extract of Rhapis excelsa (Arecaceae) leaves resulted in the highest percentage of reduction of viral load (98.1%), followed by the ethyl acetate extract of Vernonia amygdalina (Compositae) leaves (95.5%). The corresponding 50% effective concentrations (EC50) and selectivity indices for these two extracts were 29.9 \u00b1 0.9 and 32.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u03bcg/ml, and 5.4 and 5.1 respectively. Rhapis excelsa and Vernonia amygdalina could be sources of anti-Chikungunya virus agents.
