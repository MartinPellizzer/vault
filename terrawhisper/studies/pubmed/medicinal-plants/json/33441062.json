Among patients receiving current standard treatments, including surgery, irradiation, and chemotherapy, the overall survival (OS) period with GBM is less than one year. The high mortality frequency of GBM is due to its aggressive nature, including accelerated growth, deregulated apoptosis, and invasion into surrounding tissues. The understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of GBM is, therefore, crucial for identifying, designing, and repurposing potential agents in future therapeutic approaches. In recent decades, it has been apparent that several neurotransmitters, specifically substance P (SP), an undecapeptide in the family of neuropeptides tachykinins, are found in astrocytes. After binding to the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), the SP controls cancer cell growth, exerts antiapoptotic impacts, stimulates cell invasion/metastasis, and activates vascularization. Since SP/NK-1R signaling pathway is a growth driver in many cancers, this potential mechanism is proposed as an additional target for treating GBM. Following an evaluation of the function of both SP and its NK-1R inhibitors in neoplastic cells, we recommend a unique and promising approach for the treatment of patients with GBM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Motamed-Sanaye", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sabri", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soltani", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karkon-Shayan", "ForeName": "Sepideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Radvar", "ForeName": "Sarvin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Javid", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Academic Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull HU3 2JZ, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Sathyapalan", "ForeName": "Thozhukat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Neurokinin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33507-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Substance P"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Glioblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Neurokinin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substance P"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33441062", "10.2174/0929867328666210113165805", "CMC-EPUB-113290"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
