The reaction of 2-(N-carbethoxy-N-nitrosamino)propionitrile, a stable precursor of 2-cyanoethyldiazohydroxide, with deoxyguanosine, catalyzed by porcine liver esterase, was investigated. Two major deoxyguanosine adducts were produced. They were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography and characterized by their UV spectra, mass spectra, and proton magnetic resonance spectra. On the basis of these spectral data, the structures of the two adducts were assigned as 7-(2-cyanoethyl)guanine and O6-(2-cyanoethyl)deoxyguanosine. The potential of MNPN to cyanoethylate DNA in F344 rats was evaluated by measuring 7-(2-cyanoethyl)guanine and O6-(2-cyanoethyl)guanine in the liver, nasal mucosa, and esophagus. The highest levels were detected in the nasal cavity, which is one of the major target organs for the carcinogenic effects of MNPN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Naylor Dana Institute for Disease Prevention, American Health Foundation, Valhalla, New York 10595."}], "LastName": "Prokopczyk", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertinato", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hoffmann", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-29580", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60153-49-3", "NameOfSubstance": "3-(methylnitrosamino)propionitrile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3180087"]}}]}
