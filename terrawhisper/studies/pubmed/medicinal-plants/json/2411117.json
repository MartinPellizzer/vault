Clinical effects were estimated based on subjective symptoms and objective findings obtained by uroflowmetry. Twenty patients (66.7%) showed improvement of subjective symptoms and 14 patients (46.7%) showed good response in uroflowmetry. An improvement of overall clinical efficacy was observed in 21 patients (70%). These results were better than those obtained with 5.0 g a day doses of Tsumura Hachimijiogan. No significant relation between the \"Sho\" in Chinese medicine and the clinical effects of Hachimijiogan was detected. No side effects or abnormal laboratory data were found in any of these 30 patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yachiku", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaneko", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuura", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akiyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hinyokika Kiyo", "NlmUniqueID": "0421145", "ISSNLinking": "0018-1994"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2411117"]}}]}
