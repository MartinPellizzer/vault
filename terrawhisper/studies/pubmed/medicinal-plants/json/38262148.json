Thus, our research hotspot was to explore the possible renoprotective effects of rosuvastatin (Ros) and diosmetin (D) on macrophage polarization and the role of HSP70/TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB p65/NLRP3/STAT3 signaling in cis-induced AKI and study the activity of D against uropathogenic bacteria. Fifty-four albino male rats were randomized into 9 groups equally: Control, Ros, D20, D40, untreated Cis, and Cis groups cotreated with Ros, D20, D40 and Ros+D40 for 10 days. Our results indicated that Ros and D, in a dose-dependent manner, markedly restored body weight, systolic blood pressure, and renal histological architecture besides significantly upregulated SOD levels, expression of anti-inflammatory CD163 macrophages, arginase1levels, IL-10 levels,STAT3 and PCNA immunoreactivity. Also, they significantly downregulated renal index, serum urea, serum creatinine, serum cystatin c, inflammatory biomarkers (C reactive protein, IL1\u03b2 & TNF-\u03b1), MDA levels, HSP70/TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB p65/NLRP3 expressions, proinflammatory CD68 macrophages and caspase-3 immunoreactivity, resulting in a reversal of cis-induced renal damage. These findings were further confirmed by molecular docking that showed the binding affinity of Ros and D towards TLR4 and NLRP3. Furthermore, D had antibacterial action with a minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 128 to 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL and caused a delay in the growth of the tested isolates, and negatively affected the membrane integrity. In conclusion, Ros and D had antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties and switched macrophage from proinflammatory CD68 to anti-inflammatory CD163. Additionally, the targeting of HSP70/TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB p65/NLRP3/STAT3 signals are effective therapeutic strategy in AKI."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
