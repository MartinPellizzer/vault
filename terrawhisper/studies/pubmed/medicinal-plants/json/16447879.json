In each group, patients were selected and randomly divided by lottery method into the large (24 ml), middle (16 ml) and small dose (8 ml) of SI treated groups and control group. The primary treatment was same in all patients. The course of treatment was 60 days. The clinical symptoms and signs, and liver functional indexes as ALT and TBil, and liver fibrosis indexesas procollagen type III (PCIII), collagen type IV (CIV) and hyaluronic acid (HA), were measured before and after treatment.", "Different dosages of SI all could improve the clinical symptoms and decline the level of ALT, TBil, PC III, CIV and HA (P < 0. 05). Treatment of large dosages SI showed the best efficacy, superior to that of middle and small dosage of SI (P < 0.05), but no significant difference was found between the efficacy of the latter two (P > 0.05).
