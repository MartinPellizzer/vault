Because it is still on the increase throughout the world, there is a critical need for in- -depth research on the pathogenic mechanisms behind the disease as well as for efficient treatment. In the field of epigenetics, gene expression alterations that are inherited but not DNA sequence changes are investigated. Three key epigenetic changes, histone modifications, DNA methylation and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) expression, are principally responsible for the initiation and progression of different tumors. These changes are interconnected and constitute many epigenetic changes. A form of polyphenolic chemical obtained from plants called curcumin has great bioactivity against several diseases, specifically cancer. A naturally occurring substance called thymoquinone is well-known for its anticancer properties. Thymoquinone affects cancer cells through a variety of methods, according to preclinical studies. We retrieved information from popular databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI, to summarize current advancements in the efficiency of curcumin against cancer and its epigenetic regulation in terms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA expression. The present investigation offers thorough insights into the molecular processes, based on epigenetic control, that underlie the clinical use of curcumin and thymoquinone in cancerous cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Product Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chandra Shekhar Singh College of Pharmacy, Kaushambi, 212213, U.P.India."}], "LastName": "Kesharwani", "ForeName": "Roohi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Government Polytechnic Jaunpur, U.P.India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dilip K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Amita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mehanna", "ForeName": "Mohamed Gamil", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mohammad", "ForeName": "Ayman", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Medical Sciences Department, College of Medicine.
