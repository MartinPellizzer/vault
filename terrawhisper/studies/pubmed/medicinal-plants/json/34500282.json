Here, we investigated the geographical distribution of the first-known arsenic-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata in China and the key factors under two climate change scenarios (SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 5-8.5) at two time points (2030 and 2070). Species distribution model (MaxEnt) was applied to examine P. vittata distribution based on 399 samples from field surveys and existing specimen records. Further, among 23 environmental factors, 11 variables were used in the MaxEnt model, including temperature, precipitation, elevation, soil property, and UV-B radiation. The results show that P. vittata can grow in ~23% of the regions in China. Specifically, it is mainly distributed in 11 provinces of southern China, including Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. Besides, eastern Sichuan, and southern Henan, Shaanxi, and Anhui are suitable for P. vittata growth. Under two climate change scenarios, P. vittata distribution in China would decrease by ~5.76-7.46\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> in 2030 and ~3.22-4.68\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> in 2070, with southern Henan and most Jiangsu being unsuitable for P. vittata growth. Among the 11 environmental variables, the minimum temperature of coldest month (bio6) and temperature annual range (bio7) are the two key factors limiting P. vittata distribution. At bio6 <-5\u00a0\u00b0C and/or bio7 >33\u00a0\u00b0C, the regions are unsuitable for P. vittata growth. Based on the MaxEnt model, precipitation had limited effects, so P. vittata can probably survive under both dry and moist environments. This study helps guide phytoremediation of As-polluted soils using P. vittata and provides an example to evaluate habitat suitability of hyperaccumulators at international scales."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
