We detected the protective effect of Abrus cantoniensis Hance (ACH) on Carbon tetrachloride-induced (CCl<sub>4</sub>) liver injury in mice. Fifty ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) animals were grouped into five groups of control (a), CCl<sub>4</sub> (d), ACH (25\u00a0mg/kg) treated group (c), ACH (50\u00a0mg/kg) treated group (b), and ACH (100\u00a0mg/kg) treated group (e). Mice in groups d, c, b, and e were given CCl<sub>4</sub> every four days, and treated animals received daily ACH supplementation. The results showed that the daily body weights in CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced animals were slightly lower; however, the weight of ACH-treated mice increased, particularly in the higher dose group. Treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub> led to increased liver weight and liver indices in mice, whereas supplementation with ACH reduced both liver weights and liver indices in animals. Histo-pathological analysis indicated that CCl<sub>4</sub> led to inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatocellular degeneration, with collagenous fibers proliferation in ICR animals. In contrast, supplementation with ACH prominently decreased inflammatory cells and degeneration of hepatocytes and inhibited collagen fiber hyperplasia. Furthermore, the levels or concentrations of AST (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), ALT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), MDA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), IL-1\u03b2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), TNF-\u03b1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were significantly higher in CCl<sub>4</sub> induced ICR animals in group d. However, mice treated with ACH showed lower levels or concentrations of those indices in dose dependent manner. The levels of GSH-px (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), CAT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and SOD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) were significantly reduced in CCl<sub>4</sub> group; however, all these three enzymes exhibited significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in animals supplemented with ACH in dose dependent manner. The microbiome sequencing generated 1,168,327 filtered reads in the mice samples. A notable difference was observed in the composition of 6 phyla and 37 genera among the five ICR animal groups. Supplementation with ACH increased the abundance of beneficial genera of Coprococcus, Blautia and Clostridium, while concurrently decreased the presence of pathogenic genera of Mycoplasma and Helicobacter. In conclusion, we revealed that Abrus cantoniensis Hance has the potential to relieve liver damage induced by CCl<sub>4</sub>, through the reduction of inflammation, enhancement of antioxidant capacity, and regulation of intestinal microbiota."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
