The structures of these natural compounds show various types of substitution in their basic skeleton and this variability influences deeply their biological activities. These lactones are structural subunits of several natural products and serve as useful intermediates in the synthesis of different heterocyclic molecules, which exhibit a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiplasmodial, antifungal, antimicrobial, antiangiogenic and antitumoral activities, among others. Their syntheses have attracted attention of many researchers reporting many synthetic strategies to achieve 3,4-dihydroisocoumarins and other related structures.", "In this context, the isolation of these natural compounds from different sources, their syntheses and biological activities are reviewed, adding the most recent advances and related developments.", "This review aims to encourage further work on the isolation and synthesis of this class of natural products. It would be beneficial for synthetic as well as the medicinal chemists to design selective, optimized dihydroisocoumarin derivatives as potential drug candidates, since dihydroisocoumarin scaffolds have significant utility in the development of therapeutically relevant and biologically active compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Pue. 72570, Mexico. 72570, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Ortiz", "ForeName": "Aurelio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Pue. 72570, Mexico. 72570, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Castro", "ForeName": "Miriam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas, Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla, Pue. 72570, Mexico. 72570, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Sansinenea", "ForeName": "Estibaliz", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Org Synth", "NlmUniqueID": "101208457", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1794"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isocoumarins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31965925", "10.2174/1570179415666180924123439", "COS-EPUB-93173"]}}]}
