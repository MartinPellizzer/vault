The improving effects of saffron on depression and anxiety have long been discussed, with limited information about the molecular mechanism of action.", "Investigating the effect of saffron carotenoids, Crocin and Crocetin, on depression and anxiety in rats by emphasizing some signaling pathways involved.", "Depression and anxiety were induced in rats via unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Then different rat groups were treated with Crocin, Crocetin, Fluoxetine, and vehicle. Behavioral tests were done before and after treatment.", "The serum Serotonin and Corticosterone and the expression of some hippocampal signaling proteins were studied. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools were used to predict the interactions of Crocin/ Crocetin with the Serotonin transporter and NMDA receptor subunit NR2B. Then, the patch-clamp was used to study the interaction of Crocetin with the NMDA receptor.", "Various behavioral tests confirmed the induction of depression and the improvement of depression by these natural carotenoids. In addition, Crocin/ Crocetin significantly increased the decreased serum Serotonin and reduced the increased serum Corticosterone in the depressed groups. They also increased or caused a trend of increase in the CREB, ERK, BAD, BDNF, p11, and 5-HT1B expression in the hippocampus of the depressed groups. In addition, there were an increase or a trend in p-CREB/CREB, p-ERK<sub>1/2</sub> /ERK<sub>1/2</sub>, and p-BAD/BAD ratios in the Crocin/ Crocetin treated depressed groups. However, the NR2B and FOXO3a expression showed a trend of decrease in depressed groups after treatment. The bioinformatics data indicated that Crocin/ Crocetin could bind to the Serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both carotenoids bind to the same site as Fluoxetine in the SLC6A4. However, they bound to different sites on the NR2B. So, Crocetin binds to NR2B at the same site as Ifenprodil. But Crocin bound to another site. The whole cell patch-clamp recording on the normal rat hippocampus revealed a significant decrease in the NMDA peak amplitude after Crocetin treatment, indicating its inhibitory effect on this receptor.", "The antidepressant activities of Crocin/ Crocetin are possibly due to their effects on Serotonin and Corticosterone serum concentrations, NR2B expression, and the downstream signaling pathways. Furthermore, these natural carotenoids, like Fluoxetine, induced an increasing tendency in p11 and 5HT1B in depressed rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
