These molecules generally contain distinct scaffolds and characteristics that cannot be readily isolated from plants. While one-dimensional CCC is typically used for the initial purification with insufficiently resolved peaks after locating bioactive components, two-dimensional (2D) or multi-dimensional CCC strategies are employed to improve the resolution of peaks. However, these methods usually present certain disadvantages, such as complicated procedures and increased time consumption, experimental costs, and equipment requirements. Here, a bioactivity-guided cut CCC strategy was established to isolate lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitors from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Gradient-elution CCC coupled with real-time detection of LSD1 inhibition by the collected fractions was developed. Next, an online-storage recycling CCC mode was designed to enable the active fractions to be stored in coils, and these active fractions were further separated to obtain pure compounds by using sequential recycling elution. In this strategy, active fractions are first identified, and then pure LSD1 inhibitors are isolated in the 2D CCC mode through continuous separation on a single instrument. By using our bioactivity-guided cut CCC strategy, we successfully isolated six natural LSD1 inhibitors from S.\u00a0baicalensis Georgi, five of which were identified for the first time as natural LSD1 inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
