Over the past decade, use of kratom has increased despite the limited knowledge of toxicities and adverse side effects. With the current opioid epidemic, both patients and providers are seeking alternative methods to treat both addiction and pain control, and kratom as an alternative means of treatment has increasingly entered the mainstream. In this article, we present the clinical course of a 47-year-old male who developed fatigue, pruritus, and abnormal liver tests (with a mixed hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern) approximately 21 days after beginning kratom. After extensive evaluation including a negligible alcohol history, negative hepatitis serologies, and inconclusive imaging, the patient was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by kratom. Nine months after his liver tests returned to normal, he took kratom again, and after a latency of 2 days, he developed fatigue, pruritus, and loss of appetite along with abnormal liver tests (with the same biochemical profile as previously), consistent with a positive rechallenge. We believe, through the use of the Roussel-Uclaf Causality Assessment Method and expert opinion, that this is a highly likely or definite example of kratom-induced DILI. With the gaining popularity of this drug, it appears that DILI may be an important complication of kratom for providers to recognize."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA."}], "LastName": "Osborne", "ForeName": "Caroline Stokes", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA."}], "LastName": "Overstreet", "ForeName": "Amanda N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA."}], "LastName": "Rockey", "ForeName": "Don C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA."}], "LastName": "Schreiner", "ForeName": "Andrew D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K23 DK118200", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101624758", "ISSNLinking": "2324-7096"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fatigue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mitragyna"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Opioid Epidemic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pruritus"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kleiner DE, Brunt EM, Van Natta M, et al. ; Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network.
