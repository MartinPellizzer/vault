Plant secondary metabolites as lead compounds lay the foundation for the discovery and development of new drugs in disease treatment. Genus Uncaria from Rubiaceae family is a significant plant source of active alkaloids, with anti-hypertensive, sedative, anti-Alzheimer's disease, anti-drug addiction and anti-inflammatory effects. This review summarizes and discuss the research progress of Uncaria based on alkaloids in the past 15 years, mainly in the past 5 years, including biosynthesis, phytochemistry, pharmacology and structural chemistry. Among, focusing on representative compounds rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, the pharmacological activities surrounding the central nervous system and cardiovascular system are described in detail. On the basis of case studies, this article provides a brief overview of the synthesis and analogues of representative compounds types. In summary, this review provides an early basis for further searching for new targets and activities, discussing the mechanisms of pharmacological activity and studying the structure-activity relationships of active molecules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
