Regarding its impact on primary and secondary plant metabolism, CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment could be a candidate strategy to modulate the levels of nutritionally and medicinally interesting phytochemicals in herbal plants. Herein, the concentrations of 81 metabolites and minerals were evaluated in shoot tissues of parsley and dill grown under two levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, ambient (378\u202f\u00b1\u202f25\u202f\u00b5mole CO<sub>2</sub> mole<sup>-1</sup> air, aCO<sub>2</sub>) and elevated (627\u202f\u00b1\u202f24\u202f\u00b5mole CO<sub>2</sub> mole<sup>-1</sup> air, eCO<sub>2</sub>). Regardless of the plant species, eCO<sub>2</sub> improved the levels of soluble sugars, starch, organic acids, some EAAs, most of USFA, total phenolics, total flavonoids and vitamins A and E. However, notable variations in the metabolites responsiveness to eCO<sub>2</sub> were recorded among the tested plant species. Moreover, considerable improvements in the total antioxidant capacity, antiprotozoal, antibacterial and anticancer activities were recorded for parsley and dill in response to eCO<sub>2</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
