In vitro antiplasmodial activity was evaluated using the parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum NF54 and in vitro antimycobacterial activity determined against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv-GFP strain in a standard broth microdilution assay. The bioactive crude extracts were subjected to solid phase extraction with Strata-X 33\u00a0\u03bcm reversed phase cartridges and eluted with 70:30 MeOH: H<sub>2</sub>O:1% trifluoroacetic acid to yield the LLE extract, followed by a methanol rinse, herein referred to as the MeOH fraction. Both fractions were evaluated for antiplasmodial and antimycobacterial activity. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) profiling of the crude and active fractions of the phytochemically unexplored Sarcocaulon marlothii Engl. were performed to aid the identification of a potential antiplasmodial lead compound.", "Ten of the aqueous and organic crude extracts displayed antimycobacterial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>90</sub>) values ranging from 9.9 to 86.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and four crude extracts showed antiplasmodial activity with inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values between 5.2 and 17.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Although the stems of S. marlothii are traditionally used to treat TB and related symptoms, the two crude extracts displayed weak antimycobacterial activity (MIC<sub>90</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) while the crude organic extract displayed moderate antiplasmodial activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. None of the LLE extracts prepared from the ten antimycobacterial-active crudes displayed any significant activity (MIC<sub>90</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). In contrast, fractionation of three antiplasmodial-active, crude organic extracts yielded MeOH fractions which displayed a 2-fold to 19-fold increase in activity. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR profiles of the active MeOH fraction (IC<sub>50</sub> 4.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) of S. marlothii (organic, stem) revealed the likely presence of an unidentified trisubstituted cinnamic acid derivative as one of the major compounds and UPLC-MS/MS data provided additional evidence that the compound may be a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative. Unfortunately, owing to the paucity of the material obtained, we were unable to purify and unequivocally determine the structure of this active compound.", "This is the first report on the phytochemical profiling of S. marlothii and, based on the antiplasmodial activity recorded, it merits an in-depth phytochemical analysis for the unequivocal characterization of a potential antiplasmodial lead compound. Results from this study lend support to the effectiveness of extract enrichment in combination with NMR fingerprinting for antiplasmodial lead identification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
