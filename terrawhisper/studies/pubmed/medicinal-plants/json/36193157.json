This study was conducted to investigate and document the use of medicinal plants in the Sedie Muja district. Sixteen key informants were selected purposively and 72 informants were selected randomly from 5 wards. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires, group discussions, and field observation. Besides descriptive statistics, the data were analyzed using some ethnobotanical analysis tools like preference ranking, paired comparison, direct matrix ranking, informant consensus factor, and fidelity level index. A total of 89 species of medicinal plants were identified and collected with 82 genera and 44 families. Out of these, 60 species (67.42%) were used against human ailments, 10 species (11.24%) were used against livestock ailments, and 19 species (21.34%) were used to treat both human and livestock ailments. Herbs constituted the largest growth habit (40 species) followed by shrubs (33 species). The most frequently used plant part was leaves (39.9%), followed by roots (23.83%), and the condition of preparation was fresh plant materials (70.98%). The most widely used method of preparation was crushing (22.8%) followed by crushing-squeezing (11.39%). The most common route of administration was oral (49.74%) followed by dermal (30.05%). <i>Ruta chalepensis</i> was the predominant medicinal plant cited by most of the informants 62 (70%) followed by <i>Ocimum lamiifolium</i> 59 (67%). The disease category with the highest ICF value (0.90) was the evil eye. There was a high preference for <i>Euphorbia abyssinica</i> to treat stomachache. <i>Ocimum lamiifolium</i> was the most preferred species for the treatment of febrile illness. Anthropogenic factors are the major threats to medicinal plants. In general, the study area is rich in medicinal plants that have a significant role in the management of various human and livestock diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Amare Bitew Mekonnen et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9637-2460"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bahir Dar University, Department of Biology, P.O.Box 76, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Mekonnen", "ForeName": "Amare Bitew", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bahir Dar University, Department of Biology, P.O.Box 76, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Ali Seid", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bahir Dar University, Department of Biology, P.O.Box 76, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Tefera", "ForeName": "Abeba Kassa", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101215021", "ISSNLinking": "1741-427X"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ram J., Kumar A., Bhatt J.
