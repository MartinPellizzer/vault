Researchers have paid close attention to the development of very effective green chemistry approaches for the production of metal nanoparticles (NPs). The primary goal is to create an environmentally sustainable technique for generating NPs. At the nanoscale, ferro- and ferrimagnetic minerals such as magnetite exhibit superparamagnetic properties (Fe3O4). Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) have received increased interest in nanoscience and nanotechnology due to their physiochemical properties, small particle size (1-100\u00a0nm), and low toxicity. Biological resources such as bacteria, algae, fungus, and plants have been used to manufacture affordable, energy-efficient, non-toxic, and ecologically acceptable metallic NPs. Despite the growing demand for Fe3O4 nanoparticles in a variety of applications, typical chemical production processes can produce hazardous byproducts and trash, resulting in significant environmental implications. The purpose of this study is to look at the ability of Allium sativum, a member of the Alliaceae family recognized for its culinary and medicinal benefits, to synthesize Fe3O4 NPs. Extracts of Allium sativum seeds and cloves include reducing sugars like glucose, which may be used as decreasing factors in the production of Fe3O4 NPs to reduce the requirement for hazardous chemicals and increase sustainability. The analytic procedures were carried out utilizing machine learning as support vector regression (SVR). Furthermore, because Allium sativum is widely accessible and biocompatible, it is a safe and cost-effective material for the manufacture of Fe3O4 NPs. Using the regression indices metrics of root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2), the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study revealed the lighter, smoother spherical forms of NPs in the presence of aqueous garlic extract and 70.223\u00a0nm in its absence. The antifungal activity of Fe3O4 NPs against Candida albicans was investigated using a disc diffusion technique but exhibited no impact at doses of 200, 400, and 600\u00a0ppm. This characterization of the nanoparticles helps in understanding their physical properties and provides insights into their potential applications in landscape enhancement."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
