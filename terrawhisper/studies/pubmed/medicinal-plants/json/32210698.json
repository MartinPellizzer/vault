This metabolite is used for the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, Himalayan yew wood is used to prepare slabs (Tabai), coffins (Taabut), for graveyards. Due to illegal cutting of plant parts and other anthropogenic pressures, Himalayan yew is endangered, and threatened with extinction, in Himalaya<i>.</i> This species grows slowly and regenerates poorly, primarily due to low production and delayed germination (1.5-2\u00a0years) of its seeds. The study being reported here was conducted to assess the factors (natural and anthropogenic) threatening this species. Nine valleys (Miandam, Kalam, Shinko, Beha, Lalku, Shahgram, Bishigram, Gurnai, and Daral) in the Swat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan, have stands of Himalayan yew that were selected for the study. Before the survey was conducted, five informal discussions were carried out to identify people to be interviewed. A survey was conducted with 225 key informants in these valleys concerning the threats associated with this species. Nineteen percent of the respondents felt that the main problem was lack of awareness, while 17% indicated over-harvesting (peeling bark, lopping branches, etc.), and 13% thought it was slow growth. Other reasons for Himalayan yew decline included various anthropogenic pressures, such as: overgrazing, 15%; agriculture, 11%; roof construction, 9%; fuelwood, 7%; decoration, 5%; medicinal use, 3%; and other, 1% (e.g., utility poles, as blades in water turbine because of its hard nature). The results of this study suggest that there is an immediate need to protect <i>T. wallichiana</i> by increasing awareness of its importance and the threats from over-grazing; cuttings (peeling bark, lopping branches, etc.); and other damaging, anthropogenic activities. Biotechnological tools, such as vegetative propagation and in-vitro regeneration, could be practiced in nurseries and laboratories to produce large numbers of healthy, juvenile plants. In addition to in-situ and ex-situ conservation and management, there is a need for local community involvement in the large-scale reforestation efforts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, 25000 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Javaid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, Purdue University, 715 West State Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA."}], "LastName": "Meilan", "ForeName": "Richard", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Peshawar, 25000 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Bushra", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Saudi Arabia", "MedlineTA": "Saudi J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101543796", "ISSNLinking": "2213-7106"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "[ICIMOD] International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development 2004.
