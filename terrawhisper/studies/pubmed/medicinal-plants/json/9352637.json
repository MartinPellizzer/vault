The limit digest was different from those obtained from xyloglucans of Tamarindus indica and Copaifera langsdorffii. On treatment with nasturtium beta-galactosidase, two main oligosaccharides were detected by TLC and HPAEC. Using a process of enzymatic sequencing involving alternate treatments with a pure xyloglucan oligosaccharide-specific alpha-xylosidase, and a pure beta-glucosidase, both from nasturtium, their structures were deduced to be XXXG and a new oligosaccharide XXXXG. These structures were confirmed by 1H NMR. The relative proportions of XXXG and XXXXG indicate that approximately half of the subunits in Hymenaea xyloglucan are based on the new oligosaccharides. In the native polymer the XXXXG subunits are likely to carry galactosyl substituents in varying proportions, since cellulase hydrolysates contained many bands which were converted to XXXXG on hydrolysis with nasturtium beta-galactosidase. Although no comparative studies on the physico-chemical properties of Hymenaea courbaril xyloglucan have yet been performed, our results indicate that this polymer is less interactive with iodine when compared with T. indica and C. langsdorffii xyloglucans, suggesting that changes in conformation may occur due to the presence of XXXXG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Bot\u00e2nica, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Buckeridge", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crombie", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mendes", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reid", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gidley", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vieira", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Carbohydr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0043535", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6215"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cotyledon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9352637", "10.1016/s0008-6215(97)00161-4", "S0008621597001614"]}}]}
