Among them, six are previously undescribed, including four abietane-type (torreyins A-D, resp.) and two labdane-type diterpenoids (torreyins E and F). Their structures and absolute configurations were determined by a combination of spectroscopic methods, calculated/experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) data, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. In particular, torreyins A-C are rare 11,12-seco-abietane type diterpenoids possessing a dilactone moiety, and their biosynthetic pathway starting from a co-occurring abietane derivative (i.e., cyrtophyllone B) was briefly proposed. Among the isolates, 7-oxo-dehydroabietic acid and 15-methoxy-7,13-abietadien-18-oic acid showed considerable inhibitory effects against acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1\u00a0B (PTP1B), with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.1 and 6.8\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
