Direct expression from the expression vector pBtac1 was unsuccessful. A construct, encoding an extended methionyl N-terminal amino acid was expressed from the vector pET12a which supplies a signal sequence for export to the periplasm. Most of the expressed protein was located in the cytoplasm but because the periplasm is an environment conducive to the formation of disulphide bridges, only periplasmic protein was extracted. Cyanogen bromide cleavage at the sole methionyl residue removed the undesired amino acid residues that remained after signal sequence peptidase processing. The resultant ETI was assayed against trypsin and tissue plasminogen activator and found to have activity similar to that of natural ETI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cape Town, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Teixeira", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dowdle", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Botes", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "trypsin inhibitor, Erythrina caffra"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8286411", "10.1016/0167-4781(94)90119-8", "0167-4781(94)90119-8"]}}]}
