Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID), and conclusively applied to ultrasensitive detection in lake and river water. Compared with one-dimensional (1D) pencil-like ZnO, the layer-by-layer petal-like structure could fully expose mass adsorption sites on the surface, which could significantly improve the adsorption. The enrichment factors with 7535-8595 for PCBs and 3855-7320 for PAHs were achieved. The established method provided a satisfactory linear range (0.005-30 ng\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>), coefficient (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9978), ultra-low limit detection (1-3 pg\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>), and long service life (\u2265 150 times). The recoveries of 83.42-120.86\u00a0% were obtained in the real detection application of lake and river water. This work demonstrated that 3D rose-like ZnO with low cost, simple synthesis, fast extraction ability and high enrichment performance was an ideal coating material, which was hoped to enrich other compounds with similar structures with PCBs and PAHs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
