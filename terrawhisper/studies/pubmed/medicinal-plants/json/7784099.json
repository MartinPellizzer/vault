Injection of a vehicle (mineral oil, 20 microliters) did not produce any significant change in EMG activity. In contrast, injection of mustard oil (20 microliters, 20%) evoked increases in EMG activity in the jaw muscles but not in the neck muscles. The increased EMG activity evoked by mustard oil was reflected in 1 or 2 phases of increased activity. The early EMG increase occurred soon after the mustard oil injection (mean latency +/- SD: 3.5 +/- 2.3 sec), peaked within 1 min, and then subsided (mean duration: 7.5 +/- 5.2 min). The later EMG increase occurred at 14.6 +/- 10.0 min after the mustard oil injection and lasted 14.3 +/- 12.3 min. These excitatory effects of mustard oil on the EMG activity of jaw muscles appear to have a reflex basis since they could be abolished by pre-administration of local anaesthetic into the TMJ region. These results document that TMJ injection of mustard oil results in a sustained and reversible activation of jaw muscles that may be related to the reported clinical occurrence of increased muscle activity associated with trauma to the TMJ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ont.
