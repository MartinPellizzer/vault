There is no effective agent for metastatic breast cancer after surgery and chemotherapy. <i>Alhagi maurorum</i> (A.m) has been reported to exhibit an anticancer effect on various types of cancer cells in vitro. This study aimed to examine the suppressive effect of A.m alone and combined with docetaxel (DTX) on the breast cancer growth in mice models and the possible underlying mechanisms. In the present study, the mice were inoculated subcutaneously with the injections of 4T1 cells. Then, A.m, DTX, and their combination were administered intraperitoneally. The expressions of \u03b2-catenin (\u03b2-cat), FZD7, MMP2, HIF1-\u03b1, and VEGF A (vascular endothelial growth factor A) were investigated using RT-PCR method. Also, plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (GPT or ALT), aspartate transaminase (GOT or AST), serum creatinine, and urea were examined, and histological analyses of the tissues were conducted. The results demonstrated that A.m (500\u00a0mg/kg) combined with DTX significantly decreased the expression of \u03b2-cat, MMP2, and FZD7 as compared with the negative control group and monotherapies. Also, the mRNA levels of HIF1-\u03b1 and VEGF A were suppressed significantly by DTX\u00a0+\u00a0A.m (500\u00a0mg/kg). Tumor weights and sizes were significantly lower and tumor inhibition rate was significantly higher in the DTX\u00a0+\u00a0A.m group. The A.m 500\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0+\u00a0DTX also suppressed the serum GPT level in tumor-bearing mice and decreased the serum urea level. Taken together, our findings suggest that DTX combined with A.m at an optimal dose of 500\u00a0mg/kg as the optimal dose can inhibit \u03b2-cat, FZD7, MMP2, and breast cancer growth via interrupting HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF signaling and might be used as a promising antiangiogenic agent for breast cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Authors.
