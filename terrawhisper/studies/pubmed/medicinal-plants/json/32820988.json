Therefore, cellulase produced by endophytes may be useful in releasing the active ingredient of medicinal plants. <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i> Georgi is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant widely used in China and baicalin is one of its main active ingredients. In this study, fresh <i>S. baicalensis</i> Georgi was used to isolate endophytes, Congo red staining was used to screen cellulase-producing strains, and HPLC was used to determine the content of baicalin in <i>S. baicalensis</i> Georgi. As a result, a highly active strain of endophyte capable of the extraction of high levels of baicalin was obtained. The strain was named HG-5 and identified as <i>Bacillus</i> sp. Scanning electron microscopy analysis confirmed that the enzyme better promotes the dissolution of plant active ingredients. After optimizing the enzyme production and extraction processes, we found that when compared with the traditional extraction method, the baicalin yield was increased 79.31% after extraction with the HG-5 enzyme. The current study provides a novel approach and method for the use of endophyte cellulase to improve the extraction of compounds from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Key Laboratory of Screening and Processing in new Tibetan Medicine of Gansu Province, Gansu, P.R.
