Kunming mice were assigned to the normal, AP, AP\u00a0+\u00a0negative control (NC), AP\u00a0+\u00a0shRNA, AP\u00a0+\u00a0IgG and AP\u00a0+\u00a0anti IL-17 groups. ELISA was applied to measure expressions of AMY, LDH, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8. The cells were distributed into the control, blank, NC, shRNA1 and shRNA2 groups. MTT assay, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis, and expressions of S100A9, TLR4, RAGE, IL-17, HMGB1 and S100A12 in tissues and cells. Compared with the normal group, the AP group displayed increased expressions of AMY, LDH, CRP, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, S100A9, TLR4, RAGE, IL-17, HMGB1 and S100A12. The AP\u00a0+\u00a0shRNA and AP\u00a0+\u00a0anti IL-17 groups exhibited an opposite trend. The in\u00a0vivo results: Compare with the control group, the blank, NC, shRNA1 and shRNA2 groups demonstrated increased expressions of S100A9, TLR4, RAGE, IL-17, HMGB1 and S100A12, as well as cell apoptosis and cells at the G1 phase, with reduced proliferation. Compared with the blank and NC groups, the shRNA1 and shRNA2 groups had declined expressions of S100A9, TLR4, RAGE, IL-17, HMGB1 and S100A12, as well as cell apoptosis and cells at the G1 phase, with elevated proliferation. The results indicated that S100A9 gene silencing suppressed the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through blocking of the IL-17 pathway in AP."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The Authors.
