Relative folate absorption was determined by measuring 24-h urinary folate excretion and serum folate levels at 0, 1, and 2 h after ingestion of a formula meal containing 1.13 mumol PteGlu or PteGlu7 (500 micrograms PteGlu equivalent). Serum data showed PteGlu absorption was more rapid than PteGlu7 absorption. Urinary excretion of PteGlu7 was 63% (50 less than or equal to mean less than or equal to 76%) of PteGlu excretion. Addition of 30 g wheat bran to the formula meal accelerated PteGlu absorption whereas PteGlu7 absorption was not significantly affected by either food. Effects of the two foods were qualitatively different. Wheat bran increased the absorption of PteGlu relative to PteGlu7 whereas beans minimized the difference between PteGlu and PteGlu7 serum areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Western Regional Research Center, ARS, USDA, Berkeley, CA 94710."}], "LastName": "Keagy", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shane", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oace", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AM-19970", "Acronym": "AM", "Agency": "NIADDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "935E97BOY8", "NameOfSubstance": "Folic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fasting"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Folic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2827456", "10.1093/ajcn/47.1.80"]}}]}
