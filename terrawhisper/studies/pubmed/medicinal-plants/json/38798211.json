The anticancer potential was assessed against PC3 and HepG2 cell lines. The VEGFR-2 inhibition was evaluated through IC50 determination. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assays were performed to elucidate the mechanisms of action. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, MM-GBSA, and PLIP studies were conducted to investigate the binding affinities and interactions with VEGFR-2. Additionally, in silico ADMET studies were performed.", "Compound 8b demonstrated significant anti-proliferative activities with IC50 values of 16.35 \u03bcM and 8.24 \u03bcM against PC3 and HepG2 cell lines, respectively, surpassing sorafenib and exhibiting enhanced selectivity indices. Furthermore, compound 8b showed an IC50 value of 73 nM for VEGFR-2 inhibition. Cell cycle analysis revealed G2-M phase arrest, while apoptosis assays demonstrated increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Molecular docking and dynamic simulations confirmed the binding affinity and interaction of compound 8b with VEGFR-2, supported by MMGBSA and PLIP studies. In silico ADMET studies indicated the drug development potential of the synthesized thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines.", "The study highlights compound 8b as a promising VEGFR-2 inhibitor with potent anti-proliferative activities. Its mechanism of action involves cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Further, molecular docking and dynamic simulations support the strong binding affinity of compound 8b to VEGFR-2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Menoufia University, Menoufia, Shibin-Elkom, Gamal Abd Al-Nasir Street, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Sobh", "ForeName": "Eman A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, 11884, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Dahab", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh 13713, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elkaeed", "ForeName": "Eslam", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, P.O.
