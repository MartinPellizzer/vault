However, the quality evaluation of MOS has not been reported. In this present study, qualitative and quantitative analysis of MOS were conducted by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-orbitrap-HRMS) and high performance liquid chromatography-tri-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-tri-Q-LIT-MS). Totally 46 phenolic compounds (21 flavonoids and 25 tannins) were identified in the MOS, among them 14 polyphenols were not reported in raw plant materials of MOS. The simultaneous quantification of ten compounds including gallic acid, quercetin-3-O-sophoroside, ellagic acid, sophoraflavonoloside, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, avicularin, astragalin, quercitrin and juglanin, which were completed in 16\u00a0min in the negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method. Linearity was reached fine determination coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.9995). Precisions, repeatability, stability (inter-day and intra-day), and recovery were validated and the relative standard deviations (RSD) were less than 2.9%, 4.7%, 3.6% and 1.79%, respectively. This result proved the high sensitivity and efficiency of the method. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of MOS would provide the substantial basis for further quality control and medicinal values."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
