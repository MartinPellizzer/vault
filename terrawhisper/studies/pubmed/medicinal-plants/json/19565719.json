By means of observing the cytopathic effects (CPE), measuring the absorbance [D(lambda)] and counting the PFU, according to Reed-Muench assay, the TCM-ES's effective dosage of 50 percentage (EC50) and treatment index (TI) to FM1 were calculated. The inhibiting dose of 50 percentage of PFU (IC50) was also figured up.", "By CPE assay, TCM-ES'S EC50, MTC and TI to 100TCID50 FM1 strain infection were (300 +/- 18.3) mg/L, (75 +/- 6.8) mg/L and (7.1 +/- 0.7), respectively; Whereas, ribavirin's EC50, MTC and TI was (52.3 +/- 10.1) mg/L, (25 +/- 4.1) mg/L and (20.8 +/- 5.1), respectively. By Neutral Red stain assay,TCM-ES's IC50 and TI was (285.0 +/- 19.2) mg/L and (7.2 +/- 0.6), respectively; whereas ribavirin's IC50 and TI was (45.3 +/- 4. 9) mg/L and (21.2 +/- 3.1), respectively. By reducing PFU assay, the IC50 of TCM-ES and ribavirin was 300 mg/L and 50 mg/L, respectively. All the results above were almost consistent with each other (P > 0.05).", "TCM-ES assumes antiviral action on IFV-FM1 strain in a certain degree in vitro and can rebel intracellular virus.
