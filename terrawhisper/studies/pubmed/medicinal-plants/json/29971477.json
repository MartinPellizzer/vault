A. Meyer, Family Araliaceae) is one of the major medicinal and nutraceutical plants, which is native to oriental region. It is used worldwide as a popular herbal medicine because of its pharmacological effects like anti-oxidative, anti aging, anti-cancer, adaptogenic, and other health-improving activities. Chief components of ginseng identified till date are ginsenosides, a group of saponins with triterpenoid structure. Ginseng is cultivated under controlled conditions, and for harvesting of fully grown roots of the plant, the cultivation takes long duration of about 5-7\u00a0years and cultivated ginseng roots are inferior in quality and ginsenoside content. Wild Mountain ginseng is superior in quality and ginsenoside content but is scarce in nature. Therefore, for obtaining the useful compounds of this plant at commercial scale, cell and organ cultures especially adventitious roots have been established by using superior clones of wild mountain ginseng, ginseng biomass is produced by applying large scale bioreactors. In this paper, an effort has been made to shed light on the scientific literature and to decipher the evidences for quality, safety, and efficacy of ginseng adventitious roots produced from in vitro cultures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Karnatak University, Dharwad, 580003, India. nmurthy60@yahoo.co.in."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for the Development of Advanced Horticultural Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 261-763, Republic of Korea. nmurthy60@yahoo.co.in."}], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "Hosakatte Niranjana", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for the Development of Advanced Horticultural Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 261-763, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Dandin", "ForeName": "Vijayalaxmi S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for the Development of Advanced Horticultural Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 261-763, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "So-Young", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for the Development of Advanced Horticultural Technology, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, 261-763, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Paek", "ForeName": "Kee-Yoeup", "Initials": "KY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Appl Microbiol Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8406612", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29971477", "10.1007/s00253-018-9188-x", "10.1007/s00253-018-9188-x"]}}]}
