The study revealed that 88 species of 82 genera belonging to 58 families are traditionally used as medicinal plants. Thirty-two of these plants were medicinally used for the curing of Stomach or Gastric problems. Renal disorders are locally treated with 10 species. Jaundice and its associated fevers are healed with 7 species. For cough and cold 6 species are in practice. Skin diseases and wound healing are treated each with 4 species independently. Some of the plants are used as expectorant, anti diabetic and as general body tonic. Habitat fragmentation and unwise use of these plants are threatening them with extinction. Elaboration of conservation status for checking irreversible losses to the genetic resources of MAP's and introduction of wise-use practices are imperative for effective conservation of the resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Hazara University Mansehra, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shujaul Mulk", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Habib", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramzan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jan", "ForeName": "Mian Mohib", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19086529", "10.3923/pjbs.2007.1743.1746"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
