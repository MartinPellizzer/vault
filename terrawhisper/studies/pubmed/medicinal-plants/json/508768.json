Enzyme kinetics and product-formation indicate endo-hydrolase activity with weak transglycosylase capacity. The enzymes do not hydrolyse beta-glucosides, the 1,3 linkage adjacent to the reducing end of chains, or cellulose and its derivatives. They degrade mixed-linkage beta-glucans, in a manner similar to Rhizopus arrhizus endo-1,3-beta-D-glucanase, to form the products expected from hydrolysis of linkages adjacent to 1,3-beta linkages. With respect to action patterns, glucanase I (from apical growing tissue) differs from glucanase II (from basal maturing tissue) in several respects: (a) on a molar basis, I generates reducing groups from all substances more rapidly than II; (b) lower laminaridextrins are hydrolysed by I at the non-reducing terminal linkage, while II preferentially hydrolyses internal linkages; (c) laminarin is hydrolysed to lower laminaridextrins by I more rapidly than II, but I takes longer than II to completely degrade laminarin chains; (d) the enzymes are differentially sensitive to different classes of non-competitive inhibitors. It is concluded that these beta-glucanases differ in such a way that I preferentially continues to degrade fragments produced by endo-hydrolytic attack on long chains ('multiple attack' action pattern), while II hydrolyses internal linkages of the longest chains available ('multi-chain attack')."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maclachlan", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "laminaridextrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucan Endo-1,3-beta-D-Glucosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucan Endo-1,3-beta-D-Glucosidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["508768", "10.1016/0005-2744(79)90096-2", "0005-2744(79)90096-2"]}}]}
