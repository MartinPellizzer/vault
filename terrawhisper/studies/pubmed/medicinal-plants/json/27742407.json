Predominant use of the plants collected were for the treatment of some types of nutritional disorders (18%), digestive system disorders (18%), ill-defined symptoms (13%); viral infections (13%); and several cultural diseases and disorders (11%). Grains were the most frequently used plant part and oral administration was the most preferred mode of treatment.", "This study is the first to formally confirm that certain traditional rice have a role in the healthcare system of selected local communities in the Philippines.
