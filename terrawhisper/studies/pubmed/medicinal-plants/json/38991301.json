Hispolon has received a lot of attention in recent years, ascribable to its wide range of biological activities. It is a phenolic molecule that was extracted from several mushroom species such as Phellinus igniarius, Phellinus linteus, Phellinus lonicerinus, Phellinus merrillii, and Inonotus hispidus. To provide a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological activities of hispolon, this review highlights its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-diabetic activities. Several scientific research databases, including Google Scholar, Web of Science, PubMed, SciFinder, SpringerLink, Science Direct, Scopus, and, Wiley Online were used to gather the data on hispolon until May 2024. The in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that hispolon exhibited significant anticancer properties through modifying several signaling pathways including cell apoptosis, cycle arrest, autophagy, and inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis. Hispolon's antimicrobial activity was proven against many bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens, highlighting its potential use as a novel antimicrobial agent. Additionally, hispolon displayed potent anti-inflammatory activity through the suppression of key inflammatory mediators, such as inducible NO synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2), and the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathways. The antioxidant potential of hispolon was attributed to its capacity to neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, indicating a possible involvement in the prevention of oxidative stress-related illnesses. Hispolon's antidiabetic activity was associated with the inhibition of aldose reductase and \u03b1-glucosidase. Studies on hispolon emphasized its potential use as a promising scaffold for the development of novel therapeutic agents targeting various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders, and diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
