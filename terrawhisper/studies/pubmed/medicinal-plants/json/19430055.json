It was found that the plants in the Medea's garden were highly heterogeneous from the point of plant geography. Plants from humid and arid Mediterranean basin, Near, Minor and East Asia zones were found in Medea's garden. Among the most important were the plants of floristic centers of Mediterranean basin. Study of the botanical geographical aspects of medical plants gave us opportunities to establish optimal time of dissemination of medical plants diasporas in Colchis; this process is associated with climate oscillations of Holocene and intensive migrations of peoples of Mediterranean."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi Institute of Botany, Tbilisi, Georgia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gagnidze", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khelaia", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margalitadze", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Batsatsashvili", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Churadze", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Gardening"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Georgia (Republic)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19430055"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
