A combination of solvent-solvent partitioning, column chromatography, preparative thin layer chromatography and crystallization were used to obtain fractions/sub-fractions and pure compound. The wound healing potential of isolated compound was examined by fibroblasts migration and proliferation using scratch assay and CFSC dilution assay, respectively. In addition, we evaluated the gene expression of some inflammatory markers which are involved in healing process using Real Time PCR. Chemical structure of active compound was elucidated by spectrometric methods.", "Due to the higher wound healing activity of CHCl<sub>3</sub> fraction from P. vera hulls, it was fractionated by successive chromatographic techniques to yield the active compound. 3-Epimasticadienolic acid was isolated and crystallized as a white powder. This active compound (200\u202f\u03bcg/ml) significantly increased the fibroblast proliferation and migration, resulting in reduction of the scratch area about 45%. It showed a strong inhibitory effect on gene expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and a stimulation effect on NF-\u03baB gene expression at the same dose.", "The present study supported the traditional uses of P. vera hulls for wound-healing and 3-epimasticadienolic acid showed significantly potent on wound repair."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
