Data obtained were analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics software V23 and inferences made accordingly.", "All (100.00%) of the outpatients were familiar with herbal medicines, 67.86% had used herbal medicines in the past and 25.00% were currently taking herbal medicines as at the time of study. It was also found that 54.35% of the respondents use herbal medicines in no specific dose, 47.83% use the herbs with various additives, and 39.13% take their herbs concurrently with orthodox medicines. A total of 13.73% of the respondents prefer to use herbs when sick and another 35.29% prefer a combination of herbs and orthodox medicines.", "Most of the patient-respondents prefer to include herbal medicines in their therapies.
