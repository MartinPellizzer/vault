However, the use of Bupleuri Radix is very confused. Twenty-five species and eight varieties of Bupleurum have been used as Bupleuri Radix in different regions of China. It is very difficult to identify these Bupleurum species using traditional morphological method. In order to establish a fast and effective method to identify these Bupleurum species, we collected 168 Bupleurum medicinal plants from 14 populations of 9 provinces, and amplified their ITS sequences. 168 ITS sequences with a full length of 600-606 bp were obtained. DNAMAN analyzing results showed that 86 variable sites were present in these sequences and 19 haplotypes (TH1-TH19) were determined. After calculating K2P distance and analyzing an NJ tree, we established a molecular identification method based on ITS sequence. Using this method, 52 samples of Bupleuri Radix were identified successfully. Furthermore, we tested saikosaponin a, c, d content in these Bupleuri Radix by HPLC and analyzed the results by ANOVA and LSD T test to evaluate the quality of Bupleuri Radix. This method is significant for effective identification of Bupleurum medicinal plants, and quality control of Bupleuri Radix in the market."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Bo-chuan", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wen-dong", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yong-sheng", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Lin-feng", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Rui-chao", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UR635J3F00", "NameOfSubstance": "saikosaponin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bupleurum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29911830"]}}]}
