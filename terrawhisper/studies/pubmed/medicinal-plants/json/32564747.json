The bark of Taxus can produce taxol, a natural antineoplastic drug that is widely used in the treatment of breast, ovarian and lung cancers. However, the low content of taxol in the bark of Taxus can not meet the growing clinical demands, so the current research aims at finding ways to increase taxol production.", "In this review, the research progress of taxol including the factors affecting the taxol content, biosynthesis pathway of taxol, production of taxol in vitro and the application of multi-omics approaches in Taxus as well as future research prospects will be discussed.", "The taxol content is not only dependent on the species, age and tissues but is also affected by light, moisture levels, temperature, soil fertility and microbes. Most of the enzymes in the taxol biosynthesis pathway have been identified and characterized. Total chemical synthesis, semi-synthesis, plant cell culture and biosynthesis in endophytic fungi have been explored to product taxol. Multi-omics have been used to study Taxus and taxol.", "Further efforts in the identification of unknown enzymes in the taxol biosynthesis pathway, establishment of the genetic transformation system in Taxus and the regulatory mechanism of taxol biosynthesis and Taxus cell growth will play a significant role in improving the yield of taxol in Taxus cells and plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Tree Genetics and Breeding, Key Laboratory of Tree Breeding and Cultivation of State Forestry Administration, The Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Fenjuan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Agriculture and Food, Canberra, ACT, Australia."}], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "Iain W", "Initials": "IW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Tree Genetics and Breeding, Key Laboratory of Tree Breeding and Cultivation of State Forestry Administration, The Research Institute of Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Deyou", "Initials": "D"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31670676", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "31700584", "Agency": "Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Biomedical Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32564747", "10.2174/1389201021666200621163333", "CPB-EPUB-107515"]}}]}
