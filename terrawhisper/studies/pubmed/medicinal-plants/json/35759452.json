DAPK3 induces morphological alterations in apoptosis when overexpressed, and it is considered a potential drug target in antihypertensive and anticancer drug development. In this article, we report new findings from a structure-guided virtual screening for discovery of phytochemicals that could modulate the elevated expression of DAPK3, and with an eye to anticancer drug discovery. We used the Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry and Therapeutics (IMPPAT), a curated database, as part of the methodology. The potential initial hits were identified based on their physicochemical properties and binding affinity toward DAPK3. Subsequently, various filters for drug likeness followed by interaction analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 100 nsec were performed to explore the conformational sampling and stability of DAPK3 with the candidate molecules. Notably, the data from all-atom MD simulations and principal component analysis suggested that DAPK3 forms stable complexes with ketanserin and rotenone. In conclusion, this study supports the idea that ketanserin and rotenone bind to DAPK3, and show stability, which can be further explored as promising scaffolds in drug development and therapeutics innovation in clinical contexts such as hypertension and various types of cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Guangzhou College of Technology and Business, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Chaddha", "ForeName": "Muskan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7003-9846"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Science, College of Applied Sciences-Qurayyat, Jouf University, Sakakah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elasbali", "ForeName": "Abdelbaset Mohamed", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering, Guangzhou College of Technology and Business, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhixin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, College of Medicine and Medical Sciences, Arabian Gulf University, Manama, Bahrain."}], "LastName": "Jairajpuri", "ForeName": "Deeba Shamim", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0151-8309"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Qassim University, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alhumaydhi", "ForeName": "Fahad A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0399-4835"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Mohammad", "ForeName": "Taj", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Qassim University, Buraidah, Saudia Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdulmonem", "ForeName": "Waleed Al", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, College of Pharmacy Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Sharaf", "ForeName": "Sharaf E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3663-4940"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Md Imtaiyaz", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "OMICS", "NlmUniqueID": "101131135", "ISSNLinking": "1536-2310"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03L9OT429T", "NameOfSubstance": "Rotenone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97F9DE4CT4", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketanserin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "DAPK3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Death-Associated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Death-Associated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Early Detection of Cancer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ketanserin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rotenone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35759452", "10.1089/omi.2022.0044"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
