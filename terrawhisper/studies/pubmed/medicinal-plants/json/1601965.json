Assays were performed by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation and ultraviolet detection of reaction products. Use of HPLC permitted assay of low activities of PAL and TAL for periods up to approximately four and two days, respectively. HPLC also facilitated the accurate quantitation of the product of the TAL reaction, trans-p-coumaric acid, which was observed to isomerize readily under experimental conditions. PAL and TAL were associated throughout the purification procedure, with TAL activity at 0.6-1.3% of PAL activity. It was concluded that, contrary to previous reports, TAL and PAL activities are mediated by the same enzyme, or else by chromatographically very similar enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK."}], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hammond", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brearley", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "0427043"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propionates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140-10-3", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia-Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "L-tyrosine ammonia-lyase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.3.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IBS9D1EU3J", "NameOfSubstance": "p-coumaric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia-Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Propionates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "17", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1601965", "10.1016/0378-4347(92)80134-c"]}}]}
