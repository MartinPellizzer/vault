RECH. f. was analysed by GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one constituents accounting to 99.5% of the total oil were identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes (93.3%) were the predominant portion of the oil with pulegone (45.8%), piperitenone (17.4%), p-menth-3-en-8-ol (12.5%) and thymol (8.0%) as the main constituents. Antibacterial activity of the oil and its two main compounds and various extracts of plant were tested against seven Gram-(+) or Gram-(-) bacteria. It was found that the oil and MeOH extract (M) exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. The samples were also subjected to screening for their possible antioxidant activity by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrazylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The free radical scavenging activity of MeOH extract (M) was superior to all other extracts (IC50=30.7 microg/ml), while the oil was less effective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University; Tehran, Iran. p-salehi@cc.sbu.ac.ir"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sonboli", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eftekhar", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nejad-Ebrahimi", "ForeName": "Samad", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yousefzadi", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16204941", "10.1248/bpb.28.1892", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/28.1892"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
