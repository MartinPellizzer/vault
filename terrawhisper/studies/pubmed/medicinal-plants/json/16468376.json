Then modeled diabetic animals were divided into model group, HLJD group, and aspirin group. Normal ratsfed with routine chow were designated as normal group. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed in all animals, 9 weeks after treatment, the changes of murine body weights and levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol(HDL-C), fasting serum insulin (FINS), serum nitric oxide, plasma endothelin, angiotensin II and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) were determined 10 weeks after treatment.", "Compared with model group, the result of OGTT of HLJD group was improved. The levels of the body weights, TC, TG and ET in HLJD group weredecreased (P < 0.05). The levels of FBG,INS, AngII and vWFwere significantly decreased (P < 0.01), and the levels of HDL-C and NO were obviously increased (P < 0.05), as compared with those in model group. Furthermore. The levels of FBG was lower in HLJD group than in aspirin group (P < 0.05), and the improvement of TG, HDL-C,NO, AngII, vWF levels in HLJD group was more greatly than that in aspirin group, but there was not significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05).", "It is suggested by the present results that HLJD decoction could protect vascular endothelium from early damage in type 2 diabetes. The protective effects of HLJD on endothelium might be related to its ability of reducing the blood glucose, adjusting plasma lipids profiles, improving insulin resistance, antagonizing inflammatory mediators and inducing endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Integrative Traditional & Western Medicine, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Yan-ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Fu-er", "Initials": "FE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li-jun", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leng", "ForeName": "San-hua", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai-fu", "Initials": "KF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "von Willebrand Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11128-99-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coptis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "von Willebrand Factor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16468376"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
