Their structures were elucidated through the interpretation of HRESIMS, NMR, ECD, and X-ray diffraction data. MTT assays on human cancer cell lines (HepG2, A549, SGC7901, and SW480) revealed that compounds 3-8, 11, and 13 exhibited broad-spectrum antiproliferative activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.59 to 21.78\u00a0\u03bcM.
