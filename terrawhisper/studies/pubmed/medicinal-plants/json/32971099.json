The SVMPs from elapid venoms are not well elucidated compared with those from viperid and crotalid venoms. Atrase B is a nonhemorrhagic P-III SVMP purified from the Naja atra venom, which possesses a weak fibrinogenolytic activity. In this paper, the activity and mechanism of atrase B against platelet aggregation and blood coagulation were investigated. The in vitro assay showed that atrase B remarkably inhibited ristocetin- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by cleavage of the platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib, and the coagulation of normal human plasma, which may be caused by inhibiting coagulation factor VIII predominantly. When atrase B was intravenously injected into rats at doses of 0.05 and 0.30\u00a0mg/kg, the activated partial thromboplastin and the thrombin times were significantly prolonged in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the fibrinogen level decreased, but only a high dose of atrase B showed remarkable activity against platelet aggregation. Results suggested that anticoagulation was a more important function of atrase B compared with its activity against platelet aggregation. These results indicated that atrase B may play an important role in the anticoagulant properties of Naja atra venom. In addition, atrase B may be a potent anticoagulant agent because its effectiveness in vivo against platelet aggregation and blood coagulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
