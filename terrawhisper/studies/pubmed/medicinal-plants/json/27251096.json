The agr typing method is an important tool for epidemiological investigation about S.\u00a0aureus. The aims of the present study were to detect biofilm related genes, 5 classical enterotoxin genes and the agr types among S.\u00a0aureus isolates. The ability of S.\u00a0aureus isolates to produce biofilm was evaluated by modified CRA plate. Six biofilm related adhesion genes (icaD, icaA, fnbA, bap, clfA and cna), five classical enterotoxin genes (sea, seb, sec, sed and see) and tst-1 gene were detected by PCR methods. Multiplex-PCR was used to determination of the agr groups. 55 out of 80(68.8%) S.\u00a0aureus isolates were biofilm producer. The icaD gene was detected in 70 (87.5%) of isolates. The prevalence rates of fnbA, icaA, clfA, cna and bap were 72.5, 56.25, 50, 22.5, and 5% respectively. The agr group I and III were detected in 57.5% 25% of studied isolates. The sea, sed and tst-1 genes were found in 10%, 7.5% and 1.25% of isolates respectively. The majority of S.\u00a0aureus were able to produce biofilm. Significant associations were observed between presence of the icaD, icaA, fnbA, clfA and the cna genes as well as biofilm formation. The present study revealed that isolates with the agr type III are more potent for biofilm production. Our data supported a possible link between the agr types and certain SE genes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
