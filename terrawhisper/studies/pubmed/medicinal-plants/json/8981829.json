Many 9,19-cyclolanostane glycosides have been isolated from Cimicifuga and related genera. Two biogenetically key compounds, acetylshengmanol xyloside and cimicifugoside H-1, were isolated and their chemical structures were elucidated by our group. The former compound seems to be the parent component of the other glycosides such as cimigenol xyloside from C. dahurica, C. iaponica and C. acerina. The latter glycoside, cimicifugoside H-1 was isolated together with cimicifugosides H-2-H-6 from commercial Cimicifugae Rhizoma. They are novel glycosides having a hydroxyl group ay C-11, and cimicifugosides H-3, H-4 and H-6 were trinor-triterpenol glycosides. Cimicifugoside H-1 changed into H-2, H-3 and H-4 under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the structure elucidation of the above glycosides and their chemical transformation into other Cimicifuga glycosides are described."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sakurai", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "75"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8981829", "10.1248/yakushi1947.116.11_850"]}}]}
