The blood glucose levels were determined for 6 hours and 15 days during this treatment. The oral glucose tolerance and phytochemical tests and the analysis of histopathological changes of the liver were performed. The antioxidant activity of aqueous T. nudatum extract was also assessed using the method of trapping of free radical 2,2- diphenyl-1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH).", "T. nudatum Aerial Part Aqueous Extract (TNAPAE) reduced the blood glucose levels in both normal and diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that TNAPAE treatment exhibited a significant hypoglycemic effect without altering the body weight. In addition, a noticeable influence on glucose tolerance was also observed after TNAPAE treatment. Moreover, TNAPAE was able to exhibit a beneficial effect on the histological structure of the liver.
