To clarify the detailed mechanism of hepatoprotective effects of PSPC, we investigated the potential protective effect of PSPC against caspase-3 activation induced by d-gal, as well as its influence on Bcl-2 levels and PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway. The results of TUNEL assay showed that PSPC effectively suppressed the d-gal-induced hepatocytes apoptosis, suggesting that anti-apoptosis mechanism was involved in PSPC-mediated protection against d-gal-induced liver injury in mouse. PSPC significantly increased GSH levels and promoted a marked increase in the activities of GSH related enzymes including GR, GST in d-gal-treated mice. The activation and activity of caspase-3 were markedly inhibited by the treatment of PSPC in the livers of d-gal-treated mice. Furthermore, the level of Bcl-2 was significantly raised, and the levels of PI3K p110 and phosphorylated Akt were also largely enhanced by the treatment of PSPC in the livers of d-gal-treated mice. In conclusion, these results suggested that PSPC could protect mouse liver against d-gal-induced hepatocyte apoptosis via attenuating oxidative stress, inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 and enhancing cell survival signaling (enhancing the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Crown Copyright (c) 2010.
