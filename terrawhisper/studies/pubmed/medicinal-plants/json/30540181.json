Although noble metal-based catalysts have demonstrated high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction, their application is limited by their high cost and low availability. Here we report the use of a molecule-to-cluster strategy for preparing ultrasmall trimetallic clusters by using the polyoxometalate molecule as a precursor. Ultrafine (0.8 nm) transition-metal clusters with controllable chemical composition are obtained. The transition-metal clusters enable highly efficient oxygen evolution through water electrolysis in alkaline media, manifested by an overpotential of 192 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, a low Tafel slope of 36 mV dec<sup>-1</sup>, and long-term stability for 30 h of electrolysis. We note, however, that besides the excellent performance as an oxygen evolution catalyst, our molecule-to-cluster strategy provides a means to achieve well-defined transition-metal clusters in the subnanometer regime, which potentially can have an impact on several other applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Xin-Bao", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xing-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5333-511X"], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9239-0541"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 90187 , Sweden."}], "LastName": "Gracia-Espino", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "San-Gui", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Hai-Wei", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 90187 , Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization , Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi 830011 , China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Guang-Zhi", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xin-Jing", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Hong-Gang", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhi", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5080-8273"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics , Ume\u00e5 University , Ume\u00e5 90187 , Sweden."}], "LastName": "Wagberg", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Su-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Physical Chemistry of Solid Surfaces, and Department of Chemistry, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Xiamen University , Xiamen , 361005 , China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lan-Sun", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Chem Soc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503056", "ISSNLinking": "0002-7863"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30540181", "10.1021/jacs.8b09076"]}}]}
