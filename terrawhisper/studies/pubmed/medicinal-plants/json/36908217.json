The smut fungus \"<i>Ustilago esculenta\"</i> parasitizes <i>Z. latifolia</i> and induces culm expansion to form a vegetable named Jiaobai, which has a unique taste and nutritional attributes. However, the postharvest quality of water bamboo shoots is still a big challenge for farmers and merchants. This paper traced the origin, development process, and morphological characteristics of <i>Z. latifolia</i>. Subsequently, the compilation of the primary nutrients and bioactive substances are presented in context to their effects on ecology a postharvest storage and preservation methods. Furthermore, the industrial, environmental, and material science applications of <i>Z. latifolia</i> in the fields of industry were discussed. Finally, the primary objective of the review proposes future directions for research to support the development of <i>Z. latifolia</i> industry and aid in maximizing its value. To sum up, <i>Z. latifolia</i>, aside from its potential as material it can be utilized to make different productions and improve the existing applications. This paper provides an emerging strategy for researchers undertaking <i>Z. latifolia</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key
