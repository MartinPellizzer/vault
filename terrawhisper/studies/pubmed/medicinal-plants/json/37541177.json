Patients diagnosed with IBD often experience necessitate long-term pharmacological interventions. Among the multitude of administration routes available for treating IBD, oral administration has gained significant popularity owing to its convenience and widespread utilization. In recent years, there has been extensive evaluation of the efficacy of orally administered herbal medicinal products and their extracts as a means of treating IBD. Consequently, substantial evidence has emerged, supporting their effectiveness in IBD treatment. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of recent studies evaluating the effects of herbal medicinal products in the treatment of IBD. We delved into the regulatory role of these products in modulating immunity and maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier. Additionally, we examined their impact on antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory properties, and the modulation of intestinal flora. By exploring these aspects, we aimed to emphasize the significant advantages associated with the use of oral herbal medicinal products in the treatment of IBD. Of particular note, this review introduced the concept of herbal plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (PDENs) as the active ingredient in herbal medicinal products for the treatment of IBD. The inclusion of PDENs offers distinct advantages, including enhanced tissue penetration and improved physical and chemical stability. These unique attributes not only demonstrate the potential of PDENs but also pave the way for the modernization of herbal medicinal products in IBD treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
