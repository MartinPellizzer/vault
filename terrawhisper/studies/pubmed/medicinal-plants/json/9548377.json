Each of the four populations exhibited cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and contained mitochondrial DNA and cardiolipin; plastid and glyoxysome content were found to be relatively low. Five mitochondrial membrane proteins, COXII/III, ATPase alpha/beta and porin, and a matrix enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), were detected by immunoblots in all four populations. Another matrix enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase was detected only in the two respiratory-competent 1500S populations. The two 150S populations contained a previously unidentified organelle that lacked demonstrable respiratory capability. This organelle, which we have tentatively referred to as \"slow-sedimenting (ss-) mitochondrion\", was small in size (below light-optics resolution, 70-300nm, majority < or =200nm) and possessed a peculiar looking boundary membrane, ribosomes, and an occasional prominent electron-dense spot. Characteristically, ss-mitochondria were almost always in contact with a filament-aligned membrane-like structure of varying length. Cristae structure, while undetected in small ss-mitochondria, appeared in larger individuals. Typical mitochondria were found in the denser 1500S population, while the lighter 1500S population consisted of 300-800 nm mitochondria exhibiting a varying degree of size-dependent inner membrane folding. Using electron microscopy (EM) immunolocalization and serial sectioning, we have identified in situ organelles resembling in size and in fine structure the ss-mitochondria, which also exhibit a size-dependent folding of the inner membrane. These results suggest that small ss-mitochondria may undergo a progressive development in situ. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the existence of a pattern of structure-function-coordinated gross heterogeneity among mitochondria. This pattern of mitochondrial heterogeneity, characterized both in isolated mitochondria and in situ, implies that small ss-mitochondria may represent a type of \"nascent mitochondria\" derived from a yet unidentified mitochondria-propagation mode operating during rapid seedling growth. Mitochondrial division by binary fission, characterized by the appearance of dumbbell-shaped intermediates, was also detected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lo", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jane", "ForeName": "W N", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "7906240", "ISSNLinking": "0171-9335"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiolipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.9.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Electron Transport Complex IV"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiolipins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport Complex IV"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Heterogeneity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organelles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9548377", "10.1016/S0171-9335(98)80062-9", "S0171-9335(98)80062-9"]}}]}
