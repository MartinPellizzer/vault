The spectral range of the SMHI system is 1090-1820\u00a0nm (5500-9100\u00a0cm-1) with spectral and spatial resolutions of 4\u00a0nm and 27.3\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. Utilizing PCA-RF algorithms, the geographic origin of tuberous roots and leaves from five different origins were classified with accuracies of 97.5% and 97.8%, respectively. In addition, spatial identification of tuberous root and taproot tubers in a mixed sample was done with an accuracy of 98.98%. The accuracy of origin classification and spatial identification are high enough which indicate the significant potential of applying SMHI system into the non-invasive spatial mapping and rapid quality assessment of medicinal herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
