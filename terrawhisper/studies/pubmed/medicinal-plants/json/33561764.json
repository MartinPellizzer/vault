In animal experiments, CA significantly protected mice from CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury, as demonstrated by reduced ALT, AST and MDA levels, enhanced SOD activity, improved liver histopathological changes, and the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. CA metabolized to chebulic acid isomers with DPPH radical scavenging activity. In a transgenic zebrafish line with liver specific expression of DsRed RFP, CA diminished the hepatotoxicity induced by 10 mM APAP.", "Experiments in cell and two animal models demonstrated consistent results and comprehensively expounded the hepatoprotective effects of CA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
