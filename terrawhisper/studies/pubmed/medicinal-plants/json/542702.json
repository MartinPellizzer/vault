Three phases were distinguished. During phases I and II the RQ was higher than unity. Sodium fluoride showed no effect on gaseous exchange during phase I while in phases II and III a progressive increase in the inhibition of the respiratory activity was obtained. Iodoacetate inhibited oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide evolution from the beginning of germination. The activities of mitochondrial enzymes increased during the germination period, especially after the first 24 hours. The respiratory control and ADP/O ratio of the isolated mitochondria increased gradually during germination, reaching maximum values at 48 hours, lower, however than the expected theoretical ones."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de la Fuente-Burguillo", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nicol\u00e1s", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Rev Esp Fisiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404475", "ISSNLinking": "0034-9402"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["542702"]}}]}
