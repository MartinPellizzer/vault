Accordingly, the women were randomly assigned to the Oak Gall (n\u202f=\u202f42) or metronidazole (n\u202f=\u202f42) groups. Diagnosis of BV was confirmed when at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria were met by the participants (whitish-grey or thin homogeneous discharge, pH\u202f\u2265\u202f4.5, the release of a fishy odor on the addition of 10 % KOH, and detection of clue cells > 20 % in the microscopic examination). For each group, either a methanol extract of Oak Gall vaginal cream or a metronidazole vaginal gel (5\u202fg) was used as intravaginal for 5 consecutive days, and all the signs or symptoms were assessed by passing 4-7 days from the treatment completion.", "At baseline, the two groups were homogenous in terms of the vaginal burning, odor, dysuria, dyspareunia, and itching. Also, all women in both groups were free of symptoms (vaginal itching and burning sensation, bad odor, dysuria, and dyspareunia) by passing one week from the intervention (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The percent of bacterial vaginosis treatment was in 33(82.1 %) patients in terms of Oak Gall group and in 34(87.5 %) patients of Metronidazole group (p=0.56). Notably, Oak Gall was as effective and safe as metronidazole in the treatment of BV in reproductive-aged women.", "Oak Gall could be recommended for women in reproductive age who are uncomfortable with the potential side effects of synthetic drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
