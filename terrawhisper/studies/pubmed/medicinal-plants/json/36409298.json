Especially, HMs have recently played a crucial role in the treatment of COVID-19 in China. However, HMs are susceptible to various factors during harvesting, processing, and marketing, affecting their clinical efficacy. Therefore, it is necessary to conclude a rapid and effective method to study HMs so that they can be used in the clinical setting with maximum medicinal value. Non-targeted analytical technology is a reliable analytical method for studying HMs because of its unique advantages in analyzing unknown components. Based on the extensive literature, the paper summarizes the benefits, limitations, and applicability of non-targeted analytical technology. Moreover, the article describes the application of non-targeted analytical technology in HMs from four aspects: structure analysis, authentication, real-time monitoring, and quality assessment. Finally, the review has prospected the development trend and challenges of non-targeted analytical technology. It can assist HMs industry researchers and engineers select non-targeted analytical technology to analyze HMs' quality and authenticity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yunnan University of Chinese Medicine, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chaoping", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36409298", "10.1080/10408347.2022.2148204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
