Conductometric detection was carried out. The retention time for chloride was 1.5 min. Linearity was obtained up to a concentration level of 100 mg/L NaCl. The method was statistically evaluated for accuracy and precision after being used to assay the chloride from mustard sauces. Within the same samples, the chloride levels obtained by IC were compared with the sodium concentrations quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Bromatology, Pharmacy Faculty, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez Ag\u00fcero", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bosch Bosch", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barrera V\u00e1zquez", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez Ruiz", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552872", "10.1021/jf9902550", "jf9902550"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
