As a functional bicyclic monoterpene, Bornyl acetate (BA) has displayed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in different types of cells and tissues. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the probable hypotensive effect of BA, an underlying mechanism(s) backboned by in-silico studies. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded via invasive blood pressure measuring technique in normotensive Sprague-Dawley rats following the administration of BA (1-80mg/kg). Docking studies were carried out with various targets involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension.RO5 and ADMET properties were also evaluated. In the current study dose-dependent reduction in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure was observed. Pretreatment with atropine and captopril significantly (p<0.001) reduced the hypotensive effect produced by BA. On the other hand docking studies showed pronounced interactions with M2 mAch receptor in an agonistic way and ACE protein in an antagonistic way. BA justified all cut-off limits of RO5 and had an acceptable predicted computational toxicity profile. Results postulate that dose-dependent hypotensive effect of BA is mediated through the muscarinic pathway and ACE inhibitory activity corresponding well with findings of in-silico studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research and Integrative Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Noor", "ForeName": "Nabeela", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research and Integrative Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Pakistan / Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alamgeer", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Najran University, Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alyami", "ForeName": "Bandar Ali", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Najran University, Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqarni", "ForeName": "Ali Omar", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Najran University, Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Yahya Saeed", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Najran University, Najran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mahnashi", "ForeName": "Mater Hussen", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Research and Integrative Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Jouf University, Aljouf, Sakaka, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Qasim", "ForeName": "Sumera", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Younis", "ForeName": "Waqas", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Ejaz", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shamim", "ForeName": "Rahat", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "213431586X", "NameOfSubstance": "bornyl acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34275808"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
