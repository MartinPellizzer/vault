Synergistic or antagonistic interactions with synthetic or antibiotic drugs have to be demonstrated by using suitable methods (e.g. isobologram analysis). The molecular modes of action may be elucidated by approaches of network pharmacology (e.g. protein-protein interaction networks).", "There is convincing evidence for the improvement of pharmacological activity at reduced side effects by hybrid combinations.
