This chapter summarizes current trends in research on medicinal plants in Mexico, with emphasis on work carried out at the authors' laboratories. The most relevant phytochemical and pharmacological profiles of a selected group of plants used widely for treating major national health problems are described.From this contribution, it is evident that in the last five decades a significant amount of research on medicinal plants has been performed by Mexican scientists. Such efforts have led to the publication of many research papers in noted peer-reviewed journals and technical books. The isolation and structural characterization of hundreds of bioactive secondary metabolites have been accomplished, and most importantly, these studies have tended to support the ethnomedical uses of many different species. A multidisciplinary approach for investigating these plants has led to an increased emphasis on areas such as phytopharmacology, phytotoxicology, quality control, regulation, and conservation issues for these valuable resources. The medicinal plants analyzed so far have shown a very broad chemical diversity of their constituents, which have a high potential for exhibiting novel mechanistic effects biologically. The chapter shows also that there is need to conduct additional clinical studies on herbal drugs, in particular because the longstanding traditional evidence for their safety is not always sufficient to assure their rational use. There is also need to move to \"omics\" approaches for investigating the holistic effect and the influence of groups of phytochemicals on the whole organism. Mexican scientists may be expected to have bright prospects in this regard, which will imbue medicinal plant research with a new dynamism in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico. rachel@unam.mx."}], "LastName": "Mata", "ForeName": "Rachel", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico. mafiguer@unam.mx."}], "LastName": "Figueroa", "ForeName": "Mario", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Navarrete", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9s", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacia, Facultad de Qu\u00edmica, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Rivero-Cruz", "ForeName": "Isabel", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Prog Chem Org Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "101605200", "ISSNLinking": "0071-7886"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30924013", "10.1007/978-3-030-01099-7_1"]}}]}
