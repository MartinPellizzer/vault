Bioassay-guided fractionation of benzene and ethyl acetate extracts led to the isolation of 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone 1) and 7-beta-D-glucosylcoumarin (skimmin 2), respectively. Umbelliferone 1 was converted into 7-acetoxycoumarin 1a, which on treatment with aluminium chloride afforded 7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin 2a. A new series of thiosemicarbazones 3a-e of 7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin with different thiosemicarbazides were synthesized. Umbelliferone was also converted into its methoxy derivative (7-methoxycoumarin 4). Subsequently, all the compounds were assessed for antiamoebic activity against HM1:IMMS strain of Entamoeba histolytica. Umbelliferone and skimmin were found to possess a very good activity with IC(50) values of 6.38 and 4.35 microM/ml, respectively. The activity drastically increased on converting compound 2a into its thiosemicarbazone derivatives 3a-e with IC(50) values ranging between 1.06 and 4.46 microM/ml. Compounds 3b,c and e with IC(50) values of 1.49, 1.56 and 1.06 microM/ml, respectively, exhibited even higher antiamoebic activity than the standard drug metronidazole (IC(50)=2.62 microg/ml). The activity of 7-methoxycoumarin (IC(50)=8.92 microM/ml) was less than umbelliferone. Compounds 3b, c and e were tested for toxicity using H9c2 cardiac myoblasts cell line. The compounds exhibit >80% viability at 3.125-200 microg/ml. It is apparent from these results that umbelliferone and skimmin may be a useful lead for the development of new antiamoebic drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi 110025, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Prince Firdoos", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhat", "ForeName": "Abdul Roouf", "Initials": "AR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azam", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0420510", "ISSNLinking": "0223-5234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amebicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiosemicarbazones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Umbelliferones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60Z60NTL4G", "NameOfSubstance": "7-hydroxycoumarin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amebicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thiosemicarbazones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Umbelliferones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18675491", "10.1016/j.ejmech.2008.06.003", "S0223-5234(08)00301-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
