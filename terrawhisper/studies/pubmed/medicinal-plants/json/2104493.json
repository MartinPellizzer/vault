PEP-I 80, 160 mg/kg was given ip twice every 4 d. Both doses were found to have significant enhancing activity on macrophages cytotoxicity against S180 sarcoma cells and malignant transformed fibroblast L929 cells. Peritoneal activated macrophages were incubated with LPS for 2 and 24 h to induce TNF and IL-1, respectively. The TNF and IL-1 activities were tested from cytotoxicity against L929 cells in an absorbance assay of enzymatic reaction and proliferation of thymocytes co-stimulated assay separately. The optimal time for TNF production was found on d 8. Significant increases in TNF and IL-1 were observed. In comparison of the effect of PEP-I on TNF with that of known priming agent BCG, there was no difference between these two, but PEP-I had a high effect on IL-1. These results suggest that cytotoxicity of macrophages primed by PEP-I is closely related to its TNF and IL-1 production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Laboratory of Natural and Synthetic Drugs, College of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Q Y", "Initials": "QY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yao Li Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8100330", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9756"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Peritoneal Cavity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma 180"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2104493"]}}]}
