The preparation with a molecular weight of 18 kDa was found to be a glycoprotein with a high half cysteine content. Isoleucine and tyrosine were found to be absent. The inhibitor was heat-stable and stable at pH 2.0 and 11.0. It was ten times less active on bovine alpha-chymotrypsin and pronase than on trypsin. It displayed weak action on subtilisin BPN, porcine elastase and pepsin. The inhibitor was most effective in blocking the total proteolytic, tryptic and chymotryptic activities of rabbit pancreatic preparation. The relative ratios of inhibitions of the three activities on rabbit, bovine and human systems were respectively 1250:100:1, 600:100:1 and 46:18:1. While different substrates (except denatured serum albumin) did not significantly alter the magnitude of inhibition of bovine trypsin, the extent of inhibition of bovine alpha-chymotrypsin by the jack bean inhibitor was highly dependent on the substrate used in the assay."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pattabiraman", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2079340"]}}]}
