The callus was mixoploid and contained haploid, diploid and tetraploid cells as shown by impulse cytophotometry. Haploid cell lines were selected by colony cloning. They were unstable and selection had to be repeated every 1-2 months. Mixoploid shoot cultures were derived from embryogenic haploid cell lines via somatic embryos. Haploid shoots were selected by explanting shoot tips. The shoots showed wide variability in cardenolide content and profile. Rooting of the haploid shoots resulted in haploid plants. These plants were smaller in size than diploid plants. Often the flowers were morphologically abnormal and showed male sterility due to crippled anthers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie, Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg, Germany. diettrich@pharmazie.uni-halle.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diettrich", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ernst", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luckner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Androgens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Androgens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Haploidy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10821049", "10.1055/s-2000-8574"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
