However, it was found that mild gas phase decompositions of protonated and ammoninted precursors (DPAP) of TGs could produce a series of abundant dehydrated product ions of aglycones ([A+H-nH<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup> (n\u2009=\u20090, 1, 2, 3\u2026)) with high efficiency and stability. Based on these considerations and findings, an innovative ESI<sup>+</sup>-MRM-DPAP-MS strategy was devised on a QTRAP 4000 instrument allowing for rapid the qualitative and quantitative analysis of plant TGs. A detailed study of 85 model compounds from 20 herbal medicines was implemented for validation and evaluation of the ESI<sup>+</sup>-MRM-DPAP-MS strategy proposed. The central composition design confirmed that collision energy (CE) played more significant roles than declustering potentials (DP) for the formation of these Q<sub>1</sub>/Q<sub>3</sub> ion pairs based on MRM-DPAP-MS. It is also noted that Q<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>w</sub> were the most important factors for the prediction of CE values by a partial least square regression model. Here, we demonstrated this generic workflow and its merits in: (1) early prediction and selection of MRM ion pairs, no matter which type of TGs, employing a new-found Q<sub>1</sub>/Q<sub>3</sub> calculation formula (Q<sub>1</sub>=[M+H/NH<sub>4</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and Q<sub>3</sub>= [A+H-nH<sub>2</sub>O]<sup>+</sup> (n\u2009=\u20090, 1, 2, 3\u2026)); (2) direct determination of practicable CE values using TGs-specific CE-estimating linear equations; (3) appearances of excellent sensitivity, stability and repeatability through real application in Aralia elata, Panax notoginseng and Caulophyllum robustum; (4) seamless application of optimal CE parameters in other triple quadrupole MS instruments such as Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra. The ESI<sup>+</sup>-MRM- DPAP-MS may service as an effective and feasible approach for analytical characterization of biological TGs from herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
