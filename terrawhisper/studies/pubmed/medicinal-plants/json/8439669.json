Peroxidase-specific activity from clover root hairs began to increase 6 hr after inoculation with R. l. bv. viciae RL300 and was localized over the entire area of their deformations. In contrast, the onset of elicitation of peroxidase activity from root hairs was delayed after inoculation with R. l. bv. trifolii ANU843 and was localized only at the site of infection thread initiation. Three wild-type strains (R. l. bv. trifolii ANU843, R. l. bv. viciae RL300 and 1003) and one hybrid transconjugant strain of R. leguminosarum containing pSym from R. l. bv. viciae 248 (RBL5715) elicited increased specific activity of peroxidases eluted from pea and clover roots in heterologous combination. A comparison of peroxidase activity eluted from pea roots inoculated with ANU843 or its pSym-cured derivative indicated that pSym is required for elicitation of peroxidase on this heterologous host. The level of peroxidase activity elicited by nodE mutants (which have extended host range) is decreased on their new host. An extracellular fraction of RL300 contained flavonoid-dependent, heat-stable, and ethanol-soluble elicitor(s) of peroxidase activity. Treatment of clover seedlings with this cell-free fraction decreased the number of root hairs infected by ANU843. We propose that elicitation of root hair peroxidase may contribute to the infection process in this Rhizobium-legume symbiosis by altering root hair wall structure at sites of incipient penetration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824."}], "LastName": "Salzwedel", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dazzo", "ForeName": "F B", "Initials": "FB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM-34331-06", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["nod"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium leguminosarum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8439669", "10.1094/mpmi-6-127"]}}]}
