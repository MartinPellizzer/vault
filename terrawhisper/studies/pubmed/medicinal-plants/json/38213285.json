An emerging form of vesicular nanocarriers, niosomes are self-assembling vesicles composed of nonionic surfactants, along with cholesterol or other amphiphilic molecules. This comprehensive review focuses on how nanosystems may aid in making anticancer and antibacterial pharmaceuticals more stable and soluble. As malleable nanodelivery instruments, the composition, types, preparation procedures, and variables affecting the structure and stability of niosomes are extensively investigated. In addition, the advantages of dual niosomes for combination therapy and the administration of multiple medications simultaneously are highlighted. Along with categorizing niosomal drug delivery systems, a comprehensive analysis of various preparation techniques, including thin-layer injection, ether injection, and microfluidization, is provided. Dual niosomes for cancer treatment are discussed in detail regarding the codelivery of two medications and the codelivery of a drug with organic, plant-based bioactive compounds or gene agents. In addition, niogelosomes and metallic niosomal carriers for targeted distribution are discussed. The review also investigates the simultaneous delivery of bioactive substances and gene agents, including siRNA, microRNA, shRNA, lncRNA, and DNA. Additional sections discuss the use of dual niosomes for cutaneous drug delivery and treating leishmanial infections, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. The study concludes by delineating the challenges and potential routes for nanoniosome-based pharmaceutical codelivery systems, which will be useful for nanomedicine practitioners and researchers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Rafsanjan, Iran. maryamroostaee3@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Roostaee", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9263-9589"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Tissue Engineering, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. atefe.drkhshani93@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Derakhshani", "ForeName": "Atefeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman, Kerman, Iran. mirhoseinihadis@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Mirhosseini", "ForeName": "Hadiseh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Research, Materials & Energy Research Center, Karaj, Iran. e.banaee@merc.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Banaee Mofakham", "ForeName": "Elmira", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1712-9367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 94531-55166, Iran.
