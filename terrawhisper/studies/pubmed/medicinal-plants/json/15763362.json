In this study, the experimental rat model of AA was used and PMs and synoviocytes were collected. The mRNAs of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were detected with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and NF-kappaB activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The IkappaB-alpha protein level in the cytoplasma was detected by Western blot. Our results showed that expression of mRNAs of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and NF-kappaB activity by PMs and synoviocytes were markedly increased compared to control group (P<0.05). In a definite concentration ranging from 30 to 120 microg/ml, SN showed inhibiting effect on the NF-kappaB activity and the expression of the mRNAs of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in AA rats in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). Positive correlations were found between changes of NF-kappaB activity and expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-1beta mRNA (P<0.01). IkappaB-alpha protein level was increased by various dosages of SN in comparison with control group (P<0.01). In conclusion, SN decreases the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta by inhibiting the NF-kappaB binding activity, which is mediated through up-regulating the IkappaB-alpha expression of PMs and synoviocytes in AA rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, PR China. wangyongjhy@163.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Yongfei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wenhua", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Minghai", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Daizhi", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphinans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63LT81K70N", "NameOfSubstance": "sinomenine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Morphinans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Synovial Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15763362", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.12.022", "S0378-8741(05)00017-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
