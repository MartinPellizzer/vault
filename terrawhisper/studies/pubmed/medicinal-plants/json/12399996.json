Variation in response to herbivore-induced plant volatiles may lead to different foraging decisions among individuals, thereby affecting both within-patch dynamics and between-patch dispersal. We found significant phenotypic and additive genetic variation in two behavioral assays of response to herbivore-induced plant volatiles among inbred isofemale lines of the predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis. In wind-tunnel tests to measure patch residence time, adult female predators from certain lines left prey patches sooner than others when a distant source of herbivore-induced plant volatiles was presented; whereas such variation disappeared when no distant volatiles were presented. In a measure of patch location, certain lines were more likely than others to locate a prey-infested leaf disc; again there was no difference when uninfested leaf discs were used. Patch location was negatively correlated with patch residence. That is, lines that were more likely to leave a prey patch in the presence of distant volatiles were also more likely to find an odor source (ie, prey patch) from a distance of 20 cm. These two foraging-related behaviors are heritable. A continuous distribution of both behaviors indicated that several to many loci may be responsible for these behavioral traits. Our line-crossing experiments suggested that maternal influence could be excluded. Substantial phenotypic variation in two other foraging-related traits, consumption and oviposition, were also detected among inbred lines. Consumption and oviposition were positively correlated; however, the relationship (slope) varied among inbred lines, suggesting that predatory mites vary in food conversion efficiency. A relationship was detected between patch residence and consumption. Patch location, as one important foraging trait, appeared to be negatively related to consumption, suggesting a trade-off between searching for patches and reproduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Entomology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, USA. fjia@oznet.ksu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Margolies", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boyer", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Charlton", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heredity (Edinb)", "NlmUniqueID": "0373007", "ISSNLinking": "0018-067X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pheromones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crosses, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Host-Parasite Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inbreeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mites"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pheromones"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Predatory Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12399996", "10.1038/sj.hdy.6800145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
