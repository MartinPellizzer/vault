Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods including 2D NMR, and they were further confirmed by X-ray crystallographic data. Lophanic acid was considered as the precursor of 1-7 in the biosynthesis pathway hypothesis. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic, anti-bacterial and anti-AIV (avian influenza virus) activities. Compound 5 showed 42.9% inhibitory activity against the cancer cell line SMMC-7721 at the concentration of 40\u00a0\u03bcM, 3 and 4 could inhibit the bacterial growth of Streptococcus sobrinus by 55.3% and 63.2% at the concentrations of 148.6 and 141.9\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, and 4 was demonstrated with antiviral activity against AIV with the inhibitory effect of 68.4% at 25\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
