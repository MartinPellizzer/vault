PLDs have been considered as a potential and promising drug target. Recently, the crystal structures of PLDs in mammalian and plant have been solved at atomic resolution. These achievements allow us to understand the structural differences among different species of PLDs and the functions of their key domains. In this review, we summarize the sequence and structure of different species of PLD isoforms, and discuss the structural mechanisms for PLD interactions with their binding partners and the functions of each key domain in the regulation of PLDs activation and catalytic reaction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
