Medicinal plants have been used from ancient time to treat cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital disorders, which may related to their muscarinic receptors effects. Several pharmacological studies revealed the inhibitory or stimulatory effect of some herbal plants on muscarinic receptors. Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar as online database were searched from the beginning of 1983 to March 2018 using following keywords: muscarinic receptor, medicinal plant, herbal medicine, and smooth muscle, animal, human, in vivo, and in vitro. The original studies in English language were included. Based on the results of the reviewed articles, more than 70 medicinal plants extracts or constituents affected muscarinic receptors (stimulatory or inhibitory) of smooth muscles in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital systems. Among them, there are some tropical plant and herbs that have been traditionally used as food additive. The therapeutic properties of these plants may be regarded in treatment of cardiovascular (hypertension and tachycardia); gastrointestinal (diarrhea, colitis, and constipation); and urological (overactive bladder, abortion, and preterm labor) diseases. However, more clinical trials are needed to use some of these medicinal plants in clinical target therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholamnezhad", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaciutical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorani", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saadat", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shakeri", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0794-0981"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boskabady", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Muscarinic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Muscarinic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30133025", "10.1002/ptr.6179"]}}]}
