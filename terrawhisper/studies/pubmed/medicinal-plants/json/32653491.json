One member of this family, Fontainea picrosperma, is the source plant for the diterpene ester tigilanol tiglate, a natural product recently approved as a treatment for canine mast cell tumours. Here we report the development of reference transcriptomes from root and leaf tissues of F. picrosperma, which include core diterpene biosynthesis genes. A total of ~12 Gb of combined clean reads were generated for assembly into 167,566 contigs with a GC (guanine-cytosine) content of ~41%. Gene ontology showed that 2286 and 2504 transcripts were enriched in the cellular process and 2369 and 2529 transcripts were enriched in the metabolic process categories in leaf and root tissue, respectively. The reference transcriptome contains genes coding for core enzymes involved in common secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways, including the diterpene biosynthesis pathway within the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4- phosphate (MEP) pathways. A phylogenetic analysis using these genes found that F. picrosperma clustered most closely to Jatropha curcas. We found a significantly higher concentration of tigilanol tiglate in F. picrosperma root tissue, which correlated with higher levels of gene expression for enzymes associated with the MVA (6 genes) and MEP (7 genes) pathways, and we hypothesise that the initial stages of tigilanol tiglate biosynthesis occur primarily in the roots of F. picrosperma. This study provides a resource for future gene-related biodiscovery investigations in F. picrosperma and diterpene biosynthesis, in particular for tigilanol tiglate and related macrocyclic diterpenes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
