Many traditional treatments involve herbal remedies. Over time, these traditional treatments have had the chance to become refined based on efficacy and safety. It was therefore hypothesized that plants that were used in the past and are still used today to treat symptoms associated with tuberculosis are more likely to contain anti-tubercular compounds than plants that have not been used continuously. To try to deduce which plants were used in Laos in the past, a collection of palm leaf manuscripts was studied and a list of plants used to treat symptoms associated with tuberculosis was compiled. Interviews were then conducted with contemporary healers to see if the same plants are still being used today. Plants that were found in the manuscripts and/or are presently used by healers were collected, extracted and were evaluated in an anti-tubercular assay. This paper presents the methods used to identify and collect plants used to treat symptoms indicative of tuberculosis, and the results of anti-TB assays to test for activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago, IL."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elkington", "ForeName": "Bethany G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Southavong", "ForeName": "Bounhong", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sydara", "ForeName": "Kongmany", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Souliya", "ForeName": "Onevilay", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vanthanouvong", "ForeName": "Manoluck", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nettavong", "ForeName": "Kongdeuane", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thammachack", "ForeName": "Bounleuth", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pak", "ForeName": "Dennis H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riley", "ForeName": "Mary C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Franzblau", "ForeName": "Scott G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soejarto", "ForeName": "D Doel", "Initials": "DD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01 TW001015", "Acronym": "TW", "Agency": "FIC NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "U01 TW001015-09", "Acronym": "TW", "Agency": "FIC NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "U01 TW001015-10", "Acronym": "TW", "Agency": "FIC NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "CoiStatement": "<b><i>Declaration of interest:</i></b> The authors report no conflicts of interest.
