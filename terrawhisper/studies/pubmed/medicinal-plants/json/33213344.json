This process initiates by restoring the wound surface coating tissue, migrating fibroblasts to form the required collagen, forming a healing tissue and finally, leading to contortion and extraction of the wound. Today, various drugs are used to heal wounds. However, the drugs used to repair wounds have some defects and side effects. In spite of all attempts to accelerate wound healing definitely, no safe drug has been introduced for this purpose. Therefore, the necessity to identify herbal plants in ethnopharmacology and ethnobotany documents with healing effects is essential. In this article, we tried to review and present effective Iranian medicinal plants and herbal compounds used for wound healing. Searching was performed on databases, including ISI Web of Science, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, ISC, SID, Magiran and some other databases. The keywords used included wound healing, skin treatment, medicinal plants, ethnobotany, and phytotherapy. In this regard, 139 medicinal plants effective on wound healing were identified based on ethnopharmacology and ethnobotanical sources of Iran. Plants such as Salvia officinalis, Echium amoenum, Verbascum spp., G1ycyrrhiza glabra, Medicago sativa, Mentha pulegium, Datura stramonium L., Alhagi spp., Aloe vera, Hypericum perforatum, Pistacia atlantica and Prosopis cineraria are the most important and useful medicinal plants used for wound healing in Iran. These native Iranian medicinal plants are rich in antioxidants and biological compounds and might be used for wound healing and preparation of new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Solati", "ForeName": "Kamal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbaszadeh", "ForeName": "Saber", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahmani", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33213344", "10.2174/1389557520666201119122608", "MRMC-EPUB-111653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
