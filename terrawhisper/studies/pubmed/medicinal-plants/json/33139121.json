The selection and breeding of rice varieties with low cadmium accumulation is one of the most economical and ecological methods to reduce cadmium exposure. In this study, two different indica rice grains under cadmium stress were subjected to mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis for the first time. When the cadmium concentration increased in rice grains, most carbohydrates and amino acids were down-regulated, except myoinositol that can prevent cadmium toxicity, which was up-regulated. d-Mannitol and l-cysteine were up-regulated with the increase of cadmium concentration in low-cadmium-accumulating rice. Also, organic acids were activated especially 13-(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E),15(Z)-octadecatrienoicacid that is related to the alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and jasmonic acid production. The determination of biomarkers and characterization of metabolic pathways might be helpful for the selection of rice varieties with low cadmium accumulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
