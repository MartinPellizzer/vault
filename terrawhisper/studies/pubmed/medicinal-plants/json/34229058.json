Despite reports that T. erecta flowers are used in folk medicine to treat cardiovascular and renal diseases, there is no study regarding its diuretic effect.", "This study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and the diuretic efficacy of the hydroethanolic extract from T. erecta (HETE) in normotensive (NTR) and hypertensive (SHR) rats.", "The HETE was analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector and mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS). Female and male NTR and SHR received the treatment with vehicle, HETE (0.01\u00a0mg/kg, 0.1\u00a0mg/kg, and 1\u00a0mg/kg) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 5\u00a0mg/kg) orally. The urinary parameters were measured at the end of the 8-h experiment.", "From HETE, saccharides and triterpenes were the main annotated compounds, such as erythrodiol and \u03b2-amyrin. The urine volume was significantly increased in the groups treated with HETE, in both male and female NTR and SHR rats, compared to the respective vehicle-treated groups. Regarding electrolytes elimination, the treatment with HETE did not reveal significant changes in the urine levels of K<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>-</sup>, but it showed a natriuretic and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sparing effects. The HETE beneficial result in reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> excretion was confirmed through the protective effect found in front of the urinary calcium oxalate precipitation and crystallization. The combination with HCTZ, a classic diuretic and saluretic medicine, significantly enhanced HETE-induced diuresis, natriuresis, and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sparing effect. On the other hand, the K<sup>+</sup>-sparing action was improved in the combination of HETE with amiloride, a standard K<sup>+</sup>-sparing diuretic. In contrast, the combination of HETE with atropine (a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist) and indomethacin (an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase enzyme), promoted an important reduction in urinary volume, but interestingly the natriuretic effect was maintained.", "This study contributed to the preclinical validation of the diuretic efficacy of T. erecta, highlighting this species as promising for the development of new pharmacological strategies for the management of kidney disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
