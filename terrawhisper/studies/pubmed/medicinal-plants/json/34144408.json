Sage (Salvia officinalis L.) is a well-known medicinal plant rich of valuable bioactive molecules such as triterpenic and phenolic acids. In the present study, the effect of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo polyploidization on morphological characteristics, anatomical structures, phytochemical traits, and expression level of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of major triterpenic acids (ursolic, betulinic, and oleanolic acids) of the plant was studied. The sterile seeds treated with different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2%) of colchicine for 24 and 48\u202fh were considered for polyploidy induction. Flow cytometry and chromosome counting were used to confirm the ploidy level of diploid (2n\u202f=\u202f2x\u202f=\u202f14, 2C DNA\u202f=\u202f1.10 pg) and tetraploid (2n\u202f=\u202f4x\u202f=\u202f28, 2C DNA\u202f=\u202f2.12 pg) plants after seven months. The highest polyploidy induction was obtained by applying 0.1% (w/v) colchicine for 48\u202fh with an efficiency of 19.05% in\u00a0vitro tetraploidy. Polyploids showed differences in leaf shape and color, leaf and stem thickness, trichrome density, root length, plant height, and number of leaves compared to diploid plants. There was also a significant decrease in rosmarinic acid content in polyploid (plants) as compared to diploid plants. Although a significant decrease in ursolic acid content was observed in polyploids, betulinic acid content associated with the expression levels of genes encoding enzymes being active in triterpene biosynthesis such as squalene epoxidase (SQE) and lupeol synthase (LUS). The expression of SQE and LUS was significantly increased in in\u00a0vitro tertaploids (2.9-fold) and in\u00a0vivo mixoploids (2.4-fold). The results confirm the idea that induced polyploidy can randomly alter breeding traits of plants as well as the content of bioactive compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
