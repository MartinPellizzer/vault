The aim of this study was to determine the anti-obesity effects of 6 weeks of aerobic exercise (AE) and supplementation of the hydroalcoholic extract of Rosa canina fruit seed (RC) in obese male rats. In this experimental study, 24 high-fat diet (HFD) obese male Wistar rats were used. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (6 rat in group), including 1. HFD (the control group), 2. HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE, 3. HFD\u00a0+\u00a0RC and 4. HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE\u00a0+\u00a0RC. An obesity protocol was implemented for 12 weeks with the consumption of HFD along with the consumption of water containing 1\u00a0% fructose. Afterwards, the animals were given access only to HFD food until the end of the study in all the groups. After the obesity protocol, 6 weeks of exercise (50-70\u00a0% VO<sub>2</sub> max) and access to the extract (1\u00a0% of the consumed food) were given. Bodyweight, subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, and some serum lipid profiles were measured in the experimental groups. The serum levels of irisin and adipolin were evaluated by the ELISA method. Expression of FNDC5 and CTRP12 in adipose tissue were determined by real-time PCR. The findings of this study showed that body weight (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), subcutaneous adipose tissue mass (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and lipid profile were significantly reduced in HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE and HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE\u00a0+\u00a0RC groups compared with the HFD group. Irisin was significantly increased in the HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE and HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE\u00a0+\u00a0RC groups compared with the HFD group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; respectively) and in the HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE\u00a0+\u00a0RC group compared with the HFD\u00a0+\u00a0RC group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Moreover, adipolin, expression of FNDC5 and CTRP12 were significantly increased in the HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE\u00a0+\u00a0RC group compared with the HFD group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004, P\u00a0=\u00a00.023, and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; respectively). Altogether, HFD\u00a0+\u00a0AE with HFD\u00a0+\u00a0RC diet supplementation could reduce weight and the risks of obesity, at least, through the up-regulation of irisin and adipolin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity.
