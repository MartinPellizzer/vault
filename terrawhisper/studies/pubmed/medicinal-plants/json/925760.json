Some seed lines were found to have 3.5 times as much cysteine as the seed line with the lowest cysteine content, perhaps offering opportunities for improvement in the nutritional quality of bean seed proteins through breeding and selections. While no correlation between cysteine levels and protein content was observed, a positive correlation was found between the specific activity of the terminal enzyme of cysteine synthesis, cysteine synthase, and the cysteine content of seeds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertagnolli", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wedding", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "48TCX9A1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "Cystine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.47", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cystine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["925760", "10.1093/jn/107.12.2122"]}}]}
