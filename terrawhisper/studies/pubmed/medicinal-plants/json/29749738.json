Little is known about the role of endophytes in accumulation of metabolites in C. songaricum. Here, the correlations between the seven active components (total sugars, flavonoids, protocatechuic acid, catechins, tannins, gallic acid, and ursolic acid) and the endophytic fungi of C. songaricum were investigated, and their causal relationships are discussed further. The results showed that the accumulation of these components and the assembly of endophytic fungi changed with different plant developmental stages. Diverse relationships including positive and negative correlation were found among chemicals and endophytic fungal operational taxonomic units based on correlation coefficient matrices, which demonstrated that the accumulation of secondary metabolites in C. songaricum is closely related to the endophytic fungal community composition. These results present new opportunities to deeply understand plant-fungal symbioses and secondary metabolite productions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5050-3384"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Chemistry , Shanxi University , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030006 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Jin-Long", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Chemistry , Shanxi University , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030006 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Food, Agricultural and Environmental Sciences , The Ohio State University , Columbus , Ohio 43210 , United States."}], "LastName": "Vijayakumar", "ForeName": "Vinod", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy , Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine , Xianyang , Shaanxi 712046 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Chemistry , Shanxi University , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030006 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng-Liang", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Chemistry , Shanxi University , Taiyuan , Shanxi 030006 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cynomorium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29749738", "10.1021/acs.jafc.8b01737"]}}]}
