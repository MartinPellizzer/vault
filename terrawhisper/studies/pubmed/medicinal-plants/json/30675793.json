This study explores the distribution of an anti-inflammatory depside, jaboticabin, in different parts of the jaboticaba plant as well as major polyphenols from the wood of jaboticaba, some with biological activity similar to jaboticabin. The peel of the fruit was found to be the major source of jaboticabin. This is the first phytochemical study of the wood of M. cauliflora. The antioxidant-activity-guided fractionation strategy successfully identified 3,3'-dimethylellagic acid-4- O-sulfate from jaboticaba wood. This ellagic acid derivative, in a manner similar to jaboticabin, showed antiradical activity and inhibited the production of the chemokine interleukin-8 after treating the human small airway epithelial cells with cigarette smoke extract. The human intestinal Caco-2 cell studies demonstrated the jaboticabin transport in vitro. The polyphenols, jaboticabin and 3,3'-dimethyellagic acid-4- O-sulfate, from jaboticaba were both found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities, thus suggesting the potential use of these compounds or even the fruits themselves for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Da-Ke", "Initials": "DK"},
