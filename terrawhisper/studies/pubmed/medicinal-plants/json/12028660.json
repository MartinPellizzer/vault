Hyssop oil is an important food additive and herbal medicine and the principal active ingredients are (-)-cis- and (-)-trans-3-pinanones. No information is available on their metabolism or specific mode of action. 2. The metabolites of cis- and trans-3-pinanones were examined from mouse and human liver microsomes and human recombinant P4503A4 with NADPH and on administration to mouse by gas chromatography/chemical ionization mass spectrometry comparison with standards from synthesis. 3. The major metabolite of cis-3-pinanone in each P450 system and in brain of the i.p.-treated mouse in quantitative studies was 2-hydroxy-cis-3-pinanone, and two minor metabolites were hydroxypinanones other than 2-hydroxy-trans-3-pinanone and 4S-hydroxy-cis-3-pinanone. The urine from oral cis-3-pinanone treatment examined on a qualitative basis contained conjugates of metabolites observed in the microsomal systems plus 2,10-dehydro-3-pinanone. 4. Trans-3-pinanone was metabolized more slowly than the cis-isomer in each system to give hydroxy derivatives different than those derived from cis-3-pinanone. 5. Cis- and trans-3-pinanones and hyssop oil act as gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor antagonists based on inhibition of 4'-ethynyl-4-n-[2,3-(3)H(2)]propylbicycloorthobenzoate ([(3)H]EBOB) binding in mouse brain membranes (IC(50) of 35-64 microM) and supported by tonic/clonic convulsions in mouse (i.p. LD(50) 175 to >250 mg kg(-1)) alleviated by diazepam. The cis-3-pinanone metabolites 2-hydroxy-cis-3-pinanone and 2,10-dehydro-3-pinanone exhibit reduced toxicity and potency for inhibition of [(3)H]EBOB binding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology Laboratory, Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, 114 Wellman Hall, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3112, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6ld", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sirisoma", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sparks", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Casida", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES08419", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Xenobiotica", "NlmUniqueID": "1306665", "ISSNLinking": "0049-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "108614-26-2", "NameOfSubstance": "1-(4-ethynylphenyl)-4-propyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo(2.2.2)octane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12028660", "10.1080/00498250110095745"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
