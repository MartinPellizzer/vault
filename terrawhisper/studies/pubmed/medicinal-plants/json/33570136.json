Ohwi.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Regulatory protein genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in response to abiotic and biotic stress, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. However, their responses to selenium (Se) stimuli have not been comprehensively studied in Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, a selenocompound-rich medicinal and edible plant. In this study, we identified a total of 436/556/1161/624 transcription factors, 134/157/308/172 transcriptional regulators, and 341/456/250/518 protein kinases, which were co-expressed with at least one selenocompound-related structural gene/sulfate transporter or phosphate transporter/reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging structural gene/isoflavone-related structural gene, respectively. Then, we identified a total of 87 expressed miRNAs by Se disposure, in which 11 miRNAs, including miR171f-3p, miR390b-3P, miR-N111b, miR-N118, miR-N30, miR-N38-3P, miR-N61a, miR-N61b, miR-N80-3p, miR-N84-3P, and miR-N90.2-3P, were significantly upregulated. We also identified a total of 1172 target genes for the 87 expressed miRNAs. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of these target genes showed that regulation of transcription, DNA-templated, integral component of membrane, nucleus, ATP binding, and plasma membrane are the top five subclassifications. Finally, we revealed that 5 miRNAs targeted 10 regulatory protein genes, which are highly correlated with at least one selenocompound-related structural gene or transporter gene; 5 miRNAs targeted 10 regulatory protein genes, which are highly correlated with at least one ROS scavenging structural gene; and 5 miRNAs targeted 9 regulatory protein genes, which are potentially involved in the isoflavone biosynthesis. Overall, the study provides us the comprehensive insight into the roles of regulatory proteins and miRNAs in response to Se stimuli in P. lobata."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
