The present study aims to determine the antiobesity effect of arq zeera and its main components thymol and cuminaldehyde in high fat diet induced obese rats and to explore its mechanism of action. In current study, orlistat was used as positive controls. Male Wistar rats were fed with HFD for 42 days to induce obesity. HFD-fed rats were administered with arq zeera, thymol, cumic aldehyde, thymol + cuminaldehyde and orlistat for 28 days. During the course of treatment, body weight and food intake frequently observed and after end of treatments, liver weight, visceral fat pad weight, plasma lipid proflie, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glucose, insulin, leptin levels and pancreatic lipase activity were studied on all treated obese rats. The histopathology of liver was also studied. After the treatments of arq zeera and its main components, body weight, food intake, liver weight, visceral fat pad weight and the level of lipid profile, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotranferase, glucose, insulin, and leptin were found to be decreased and pancreatic lipase inhibition were increased. Arq zeera showed more potential antiobesity effect than orlistat. According to our present findings, arq zeera and its main components possessed potent antiobesity effect on high fat diet -induced obese rats and excreted anti-obesity effect partly via hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, hypoinsulinemic, hypoleptinemic and pancreatic lipase inhibition action."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jamia Hamdard, Hamdard Nagar, New Delhi, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HIMT College of Pharmacy, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Mohammad Rafiul", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jamia Hamdard, Hamdard Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "H Shahid", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cymenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leptin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "95M8R751W8", "NameOfSubstance": "Orlistat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O0893NC35F", "NameOfSubstance": "cuminaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cymenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Leptin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Unani"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Orlistat"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29635674", "10.1055/a-0590-1956"]}}]}
