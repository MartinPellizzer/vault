Whether a botanical drug is used for both, food and medicine, or only as medicine depends on taste preferences, nutritional content, cultural background, and the individual and overall epidemiological context.", "We subjected 540 botanical drugs described in De Materia Medica having at least one oral medical application to a tasting panel. The 540 drugs were grouped into those only used for medicine (388) and those also used for food (152). The associations with chemosensory qualities and therapeutic indications were compared across the two groups. We considered 22 experimentally assessed chemosensory qualities and 39 categories of therapeutic use groups. We wanted to know, 1): which chemosensory qualities increase the probability of an orally applied botanical drug to be also used for food ? 2): which chemosensory qualities augment the probability of an orally applied botanical drug to be only used for medicine? and 3): whether there are differences in therapeutic indications between orally applied botanical drugs also used for food (food drugs) and botanical drugs applied exclusively for medicinal purposes (non-food drugs) and, if yes, how the differences can be explained.", "Chemosensory qualities augmenting the probability of an orally applied botanical drug to be also used for food were sweet, starchy, salty, burning/hot, fruity, nutty, and cooling. Therapeutics used for diarrhoea, as libido modulators, purgatives, laxatives, for expelling parasites, breast and lactation and increasing diuresis, were preferentially sourced from food drugs while drugs used for liver and jaundice, vaginal discharge and humoral management showed significant negative associations with food dugs in ancient Greek-Roman materia medica.", "Therapeutics used for ailments of body organs involved in the digestion of food and the excretion of waste products showed a tendency to be sourced from food drugs. Arguably, the daily consumption of food offered the possibility for observing post-prandial physiologic and pharmacologic effects which led to a high therapeutic versatility of food drugs and the possibility to understand benefits of taste and flavour qualities. The difference in chemosensory qualities between food drugs and non-food drugs is demarcating the organoleptic requirements of food rather than that of medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
