According to World Health Organization 80% of the world population depends on indigenous medicinal plant remedies. Herbal medicine employs fruits, vegetables, as dry materials or their extracts for the treatment of different diseases and health maintenance. Glycyrrhiza glabra (Liquorice) has been used in Europe since prehistoric times. It is well documented in written form starting with the ancient Greeks. Glycyrrhizin is the major active constituent obtained from liquorice roots, one of the most widely used in herbal preparations for the treatment of liver complaints. The plant is used as anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, laxative, anti-depressive, anti-ulcer and anti-diabetic. The present review focuses Glycyrrhiza glabra distribution, ethno botany, ethno pharmacology, chemical constituents, medicinal uses, cultivation and trade. Plant requires a lot of attention as it has been reduced in population due to over-use in Baluchistan. The plant conservationists should consider this herb as priority species and should start its cultivation on the commercial scale to fulfill the requirements of the local markets and pharmaceutical industries as well as reduce the pressure on the wild plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Lab., Department of Botany, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Dastagir", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hamdard Research Institute of Unani Medicine (HRIUM), Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rizvi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Afzal", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cultural Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Folklore"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "economics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27731836"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
