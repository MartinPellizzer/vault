This study reports the acute toxicity, bioconcentration, elimination and antioxidant response of fluralaner in zebrafish. All LC<sub>50</sub> values of fluralaner to zebrafish were higher than 10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> at 24, 48, 72 and 96\u00a0h. To study the bioconcentration and elimination, the zebrafish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of fluralaner (2.00 and 0.20\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) for 15\u00a0d and then held 6\u00a0d in clean water. The results showed medium BCF of fluralaner with values of 12.06 (48\u00a0h) and 21.34 (144\u00a0h) after exposure to 2.00 and 0.20\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> fluralaner, respectively. In the elimination process, a concentration of only 0.113\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> was found in zebrafish on the 6th day after removal to clean water. After exposure in 2.00\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> fluralaner, the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and GST, GSH-PX, CarE and content of MDA were measured. Only CAT and CarE activities were significantly regulated and the others stayed at a stable level compared to the control group. Meanwhile, transcriptional expression of CYP1C2, CYP1D1, CYP11A were significantly down-regulated at 12\u00a0h exposed to 2.00\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> of fluralaner. Except CYP1D1, others CYPs were up-regulated at different time during exposure periods. Fluralaner and its formulated product (BRAVECTO<sup>\u00ae</sup>) are of low toxicity to zebrafish and are rapidly concentrated in zebrafish and eliminated after exposure in clean water. Antioxidant defense and metabolic systems were involved in the fluralaner-induced toxicity. Among them, the activities of CAT and CarE, and most mRNA expression level of CYPs showed fast response to the sub-lethal concentration of fluralaner, which could be used as a biomarker relevant to the toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
