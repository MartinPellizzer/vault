However, their threshold and ecotoxicological impacts on plants are still poorly understood. In this study, the hormetic effects of TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs at a concentration range of 0-2500\u00a0mg/L on the growth, and biochemical and physiological behaviors of Nigella arvensis in a hydroponic system were examined for three weeks. The translocation of TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in plant tissues was characterized through scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The bioaccumulation of total titanium (Ti) was quantified by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Briefly, the elongation of roots and shoots and the total biomass growth were significantly promoted at 100\u00a0mg/L TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs. As the results indicated, TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs had a hormesis effect on the proline content, i.e., a stimulating effect at the low concentrations of 50 and 100\u00a0mg/L and an inhibiting effect in the highest concentration of 2500\u00a0mg/L. A biphasic dose-response was observed against TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs in shoot soluble sugar and protein contents. The inhibitory effects were detected at \u22651000\u00a0mg/L TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, where the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoid was reduced. At 1000\u00a0mg/ L, TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs significantly promoted the cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, it enhanced the total antioxidant content (TAC), total iridoid content (TIC), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity. Overall, the study revealed the physiological and biochemical alterations in a medicinal plant affected by TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs, which can help to use these NPs beneficially by eliminating their harmful effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
