This study concentrates on a key component of fitness: persistence of seeds overwinter. Seeds of three lines of oilseed rape (Brassica napus subsp. oleifera DC Metzger) and of charlock (Sinapis arvensis L.) were buried in nylon mesh bags at two depths in four habitats in each of three geographically separated sites: Cornwall, Berkshire and Sutherland. Seeds were recovered after 12 and 24 months. Charlock exhibited much greater seed survival (average 60% surviving the first year and 32.5% surviving the second year) than oilseed rape (1.5% surviving the first year and 0.2% surviving the second) at all sites. Charlock showed higher survival at 15 cm burial than 2 cm burial at certain sites, but oilseed rape showed no depth effect. Different genetic lines of oilseed rape displayed different rates of seed survival; non-transgenic rape showed greater survival (2%) than the two transgenic lines, one developed for tolerance to the antibiotic kanamycin (0.3%) and one for tolerance to both kanamycin and the herbicide glufosinate (0.25%). The absolute and relative performances of the different genetic lines of oilseed rape were context specific, illustrating the need to test hypotheses in a wide range of ecological settings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Imperial College, Ascot, Berks, UK."}], "LastName": "Hails", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rees", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kohn", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crawley", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Proc Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101245157", "ISSNLinking": "0962-8452"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Theor Biol. 1966 Sep;12(1):119-29", "ArticleIdList": ["6015423"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1992 Sep;100(1):13-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16652934"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1947 Apr;22(2):149-59", "ArticleIdList": ["16654086"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9061957", "PMC1688233", "10.1098/rspb.1997.0001"]}}]}
