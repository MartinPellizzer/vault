Two variability indices were applied to the aligned sequences and the results were analysed using the three-dimensional structures of concanavalin A and the pea lectin. The areas of greatest variability were located in the carbohydrate-binding site region, forming a perimeter around a well-conserved core. These residues are inferred to be specificity determining, in the manner of antibodies, and the most variable position corresponded to Tyr100 in concanavalin A, a known ligand contact residue. In addition to the five peptide loops known to form the binding site from crystallographic studies, a sixth segment with variable residues was located in the binding-site region, and this may contribute to oligosaccharide specificity. In their overall composition, the lectin sites resemble those of the sugar-transport proteins rather than antibodies. The prospects for modelling lectin binding sites by the methods used for antibodies were also assessed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."}], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oomen", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1469724", "10.1016/0022-2836(92)90875-k", "0022-2836(92)90875-K"]}}]}
