Phyto-constituents in EAFFZRB were identified using HPLC technique. Forty-eight male Wistar rats (140-185\u00a0g) were randomized into 6 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Groups 1 and 2 served as normal and negative controls, respectively. Diabetes was induced in test groups (2-6) using 150\u00a0mg/kg body weight (b.w) Alloxan monohydrate. Rats in groups 4-6 received of 200, 400 and 600\u00a0mg/kg b.w. EAFFZRB orally, respectively, for 21 days. Group 3 rats received 5\u00a0mg/kg b.w Glibenclamide. The effect of EAFFZRB on alterations in hematological, biochemical, and histological indices of study rats were assessed.", "Extraction of 3500\u00a0g ethanol extract yielded 15.71\u00a0g EAFFZRB. HPLC fingerprint of EAFFZRB indicated presence of luteolin, rutin, quercetin, apigenin, cinnamic acid and catechin. Diabetes triggered significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) alterations in b.w., hematological, biochemical and histological indices of test rats relative to normal control. Treatment with EAFFZRB (LD<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03807.9\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) resulted in remarkable improvements in altered b.w. changes, hematological, biochemical and histological parameters of diabetic rats.", "The study demonstrated the antidiabetic potential of EAFFZRB, providing scientific basis for traditional use of the plant in treatment of diabetes and its complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
