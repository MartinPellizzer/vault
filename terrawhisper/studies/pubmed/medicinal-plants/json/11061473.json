The proportion of ginkgo to total shade trees was 43.2% in 1998, but the allergenic characteristics of ginkgo pollen has not been elucidated.", "This study was undertaken to obtain information regarding the skin reactivity rate to ginkgo pollen in a population of Korean subjects with respiratory allergy. Possible ginkgo pollen allergens and the cross-reactivity of ginkgo pollen with other prevalent pollens were also examined.", "Four hundred and forty-seven patients with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis were skin prick tested with extract of ginkgo pollen (1:20 wt/vol). Of these patients, positive skin responders (A/H ratio > or =2+) were selected for ELISA and immunoblot experiments.", "A total of 21 patients (4.7%) showed skin reactivity (A/H ratio > or =2+) to ginkgo pollen in the skin prick test. They were also cosensitized to many other tree, grass, and weed pollens. Sixteen (76%) of the 21 positive skin responders showed specific IgE responses to ginkgo pollen in ELISA. In inhibitory ELISA, IgE binding to ginkgo pollen was inhibited by more than 80% by oak, ryegrass, mugwort, and ragweed; and 34% by hop Japanese; and 10% by rBet v 2 at 10 microg/mL. In immunoblot, 10 out of 21 sera (48%) reacted to the 15-kD protein of ginkgo pollen, 9 (43%) to 33-35 kD, and 8 (38%) to 36-38 kD. In inhibitory immunoblot, IgE binding to ginkgo pollen proteins was almost completely inhibited by oak, ryegrass, mugwort and ragweed, but only partially by hop Japanese and rBet v 2.", "The skin reactivity rate to ginkgo pollen is approximately 4.7% in a population of Korean subjects with respiratory allergy. Since ginkgo pollen has a high cross-reactivity with other prevalent pollens, it could cause clinical symptoms during its pollen season by cross-reacting with the IgE produced in response to other pollens in patients sensitized to multiple pollens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Allergy, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Y Y", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "anti-IgE antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11061473", "10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62533-1", "S1081-1206(10)62533-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
