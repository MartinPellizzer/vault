However, prolonged consumption of plants containing high levels of heavy metals (HMs) can lead to deleterious consequences. Euphorbia granulata (EG) is therapeutically used in Pakistan and many parts of the world. This study assessed EG from three districts of Khyber Pakhun Khwa, Pakistan, for the levels of seven HMs (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Ag, Hg, and As) and the associated health risks. Non-carcinogenic health risk associated with HMs was assessed from hazard quotients (THQ) and hazard index (HI). THQ values of Hg for Peshawar (1.566) and Mardan (1.897) were above the safe recommended limits (< 1) of USEPA. Overall more than 80% of THQ was contributed by the Hg alone. Total cancer risk (TCR) was calculated using incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). The hazard index (HI) displayed by Peshawar (1.87) and Mardan (2.7) samples indicated the potential adverse health effects due to EG. Furthermore, the TCR for Peshawar (2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>), Mardam (2.3 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>), and Swat (1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>) was also more than US-EPA recommended threshold value (1 \u00d7 10<sup>-4</sup>). Our results unveiled the possibility of carcinogenic health risks with Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, and As to EG consumers. Due to potential non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk, chronic use of E. granulata is not recommended, particularly from HMs contaminated sites."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
