Only subjects with concordant results in radionuclide and angiography examinations were considered as coronary artery disease patients. Exercise stress tests were performed sitting on the bicycle ergometer using a progressive loading profile (30 W for 3 min), to the symptom-limited capacity (VO2SL). Positive exercise ECG were confirmed on ST decrease (1.5 mm) or on absence or increase in R-wave-amplitude modifications (V5). In the group I patients, ECG-ST-modification sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (+) and efficiency were, respectively, 92, 82, 86 and 88%. R-wave-variation sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (+) and efficiency were, respectively, 41, 74, 65 and 56%. In the group II patients, ST-depression sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (+) and efficiency were, respectively, 100, 33, 59 and 65%. R-wave-variation sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (+) and efficiency were, respectively, 50, 70, 63 and 60%. It was concluded that R-wave-amplitude variations induced lower false positive responses than ST-segment depression in patients under digitalis treatment. False negative responses were unfortunately 50% using the R-wave criterion. Exercise ECG was finally judged as a poor indicator of CAD in patients under digitalis treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Degre", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Longo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thirion", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stoupel", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sobolski", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berkenboom", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vandermoten", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brion", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Cardiology", "NlmUniqueID": "1266406", "ISSNLinking": "0008-6312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AD84R52XLF", "NameOfSubstance": "Thallium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Angiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thallium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thorax"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7317895", "10.1159/000173334"]}}]}
