The study is aimed to analyse the content of the four triterpene compounds ( ursolic acid, corosolic acid, maslinic acid, oleanolic acid) in different organs, and investigate the dynamic changes in different phenological period. The triterpenic acids content in the samples was measured by HPLC based on the plant phenological observations. The results showed that order of four triterpenic acids content in different organs from high to low was defoliation (23.2 mg x g(-1)) > mature leaves (21.7 mg x g(-1)) > young leaves (17.5 mg x g(-1)) > fruits (7.36 mg x g(-1)) > flowers (6.40 mg x g(-1)). The triterpenic acids were not detected in the seeds. The total amount of the four triterpenic acids in the loquat leaves collected in the different phenological stages of sprout, flower bud, blossom and fruit varied between 17.8 and 26.2 mg x g(-1) (defoliation), 16.5 and 23.5 mg x g(-1) (mature leaves), 14.7 and 21.5 mg x g(-1) (young leaves), respectively. The content increased progressively with the leaf development, maturation and aging. There was a higher level of the dry material and triterpenic acids accumulation in the mature leaves during fruit enlargement. This paper attempts to present the case for medicinal plants of a broad geographical distribution to study on the secondary metabolites and harvesting time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ji-yang", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Xiao-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qian-wen", "Initials": "QW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Sheng-lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "He-qun", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Wen-xia", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mo", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Eriobotrya"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26087548"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
