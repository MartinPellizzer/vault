In the follow up KAP survey changes in the community's water contact behaviour as well as their practices in relation to sanitation were reported. The involvement of the community in the application of P. dodecandra during the course of the study ensured continued support and participation of the community. This was evidenced in the follow up survey when it was apparent that the community's attitude towards schistosomiasis had been influenced by the different activities that had taken place.", "Changes in the community's KAP with regards to schistosomiasis control, can be interpreted as an indication of the impact of the health education delivered during the course of the study. Health education should, therefore, precede programmes that require full participation of the community, as this enables the community to make informed decisions regarding their participation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Blair Research Laboratory, Harare, Zimbabwe."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gwatirisa", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ndamba", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyazema", "ForeName": "N Z", "Initials": "NZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Zimbabwe", "MedlineTA": "Cent Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0372566", "ISSNLinking": "0008-9176"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sanitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "parasitology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Snails"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zimbabwe"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10746388", "10.4314/cajm.v45i4.8460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
