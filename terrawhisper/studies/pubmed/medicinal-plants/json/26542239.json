(Araceae) were isolated, and three hemiterpene glucoside aromatic esters, pothobanosides A (1), B (2), and C (3), and a phenylisobutanoid, pothobanol (4), along with 14 known compounds, were characterized. The isolates were tested for their estrogenic/anti-estrogenic activity using the estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, and syringoyl derivatives (2, 3, and canthoside B) showed strong inhibitory activity against both cell lines. Their less oxygenated analogs (1, and markhamioside F) were almost inactive. The isolates were also evaluated for hyaluronidase and histamine release inhibitory activities, and pothobanoside A (1) showed significant hyaluronidase inhibitory activity among the isolated compounds, which was similar to that of the positive control rosmarinic acid. Because hyaluronidase produces an angiogenic response that has been implicated in tumor invasiveness and metastasis, 1 could be valuable as an anti-tumor compound with a different mechanism of action from related compounds (2, 3). Pothobanoside C (3) and pothobanol (4) were also found to inhibit histamine release to a similar degree to the positive control epigallocatechin 3-O-(3\"-O-methyl)-gallate. The histamine release inhibitory potency of these isolates may support the traditional uses of this plant in folk medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
