Members of this large gene family have been assigned broad biological functions from defense to acting as storage proteins. Despite possessing several interesting characteristics, their functions remain essentially undefined. Mulberry ( spp.) known for its medicinal benefits is also a rich source of lectins. Using an exhaustive hidden Markov model (HMM)-based search, we identified the lectin gene complement in C.K. Schneid with around 197 members. These putative lectin genes were classified into 12 distinct gene families based on the presence of characteristic sugar-binding domains. Members of this superfamily were assigned varied gene ontologies (GOs) to identify putative functions and determine cellular localizations. Interestingly, characteristic expression patterns were observed across the lectin superfamily in response to a variety of environmental cues. This is suggestive of specialized functions under diverse conditions possibly by linking the specificity of sugar recognition with mediating precise stress responses in plants. The identification of putative gene family members from the genus developed in this study can find wide applicability in lectin gene identification and characterization. It can also contribute immensely in the understanding of lectins from mulberry with potential medicinal uses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Crop Science Society of America."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Bushra", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baranwal", "ForeName": "Vinay K", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khurana", "ForeName": "Paramjit", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "101273919", "ISSNLinking": "1940-3372"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Ontology"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27898803", "10.3835/plantgenome2015.10.0107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
