At present, there have been numerous investigations on isorhamnetin, which has the effects of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular protection, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, organ protection, prevention of obesity, etc. The related mechanisms involve the regulation of PI3K/AKT/PKB, NF-\u03baB, MAPK and other signaling pathways as well as the expression of related cytokines and kinases. Isorhamnetin has a high value of development and application. However, the investigations on its mechanism of action are limited and lack of detailed scientific validation. The manuscript reviewed the pharmacological effects of isorhamnetin and related mechanisms of action for the development of its medicinal properties further."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
