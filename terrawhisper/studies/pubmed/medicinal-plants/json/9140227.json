The total saponins of red ginseng standardized on ginsenosides-Rb1, -Rb2, -Rc, -Rd, -Re, and -Rg1 were used in the present study. The rats were administered the standardized saponins of red ginseng orally at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days, followed by an administration of carbon tetrachloride at 0.4 ml/kg in corn oil intraperitoneally for 24 h. The administration of saponin changed neither body and organ weights nor hematological and serum clinical parameters. The elevation of SGPT and SGOT activities induced by carbon tetrachloride was partially recovered by the administration of the saponin. The liver vacuolization and lymphoid cell aggregation by carbon tetrachloride were clearly recovered by the red ginseng saponins as examined histologically. The present results indicated that the standardized saponins of red ginseng used in these studies may partially recover the hepatotoxicity induced by carbon tetrachloride in male Sprague Dawley rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Yusung, Taejon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J I", "Initials": "JI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roh", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9140227", "10.1055/s-2006-957630"]}}]}
