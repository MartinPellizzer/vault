The structures of these new compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic techniques (UV, IR, MS, and 1D and 2D NMR), and their absolute configurations were established by comparing experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Compounds 1-8 were evaluated for antimicrobial activities and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the broth microdilution method in 96-well culture plates. Compounds 1, 2, and 7 exhibited weak antibacterial effects for S. aureus (ATCC 6538), E. coli (ATCC 11775), and P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) with MIC values being 158-249 \u00b5g\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. Compounds 3-7 showed activities against C. glabrata (ATCC 2001) and S. aureus (ATCC 43300) with MIC values being 128-197 \u00b5g\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. Compounds 1-4 showed activity against S. aureus (ATCC 25923) with MIC values being 162-254 \u00b5g\u00b7mL<sup>-1</sup>. The present study provided a basis for future evaluation of these compounds as antibacterial agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 China Pharmaceutical University.
