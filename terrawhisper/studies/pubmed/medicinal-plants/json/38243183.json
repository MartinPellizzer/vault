One of notable active components is flavonoids, which have been found to exhibit anti-Hepatitis B Virus activity (Li et al. 2016). In 2021, a leaf spot on A. philoxeroides was observed in the science and education experimental park of Hebei Agricultural University (38\u00b049'38\u2033 N, 115\u00b026'39\u2033 E). Initial symptoms included leaf tissue water loss, chloro-sis and elliptical lesions scattered across the leaf margin with further development leading to ellipse-shaped disease spots and leaf wilting (Fig. 1A). In the field, 50 plants of A. philoxeroides were randomly selected to investigate and quantify dis-ease. Incidence of leaf disease was approximately 25%, and the infected leaves ex-hibited an average affected area of about 20%. In order to identify the pathogen, three diseased plants were randomly selected from different areas. Stems and leaves of diseased plants were cut into pieces (2 to 3 mm \u00d7 5 mm) and disinfested with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute. After rinsing with sterile water three times, each lesion sample was isolated and purified on PDA at 25\u00b0C. Eventually, all samples pro-duced morphologically consistent colonies of pure strains. From the 9 isolates ob-tained, ZLQ-1 was selected as a representative isolate for further study. Colonies were initially white, turning gray from the centre, then gray-brown with cottony aerial hyphae, and finally growing black, stiff, round or irregular sclerotia (0.6 to 4.0 mm \u00d7 1.1 to 4.2 mm, n=50) (Fig1. B, C). ZLQ-1 exhibited branched conidia with en-larged apical cells. The conidia of this isolate were unicellular, ovoid or ellipsoid in shape, with dimensions ranging from 5.8 to 16.9 \u03bcm \u00d7 6.3 to 11.2 \u03bcm (n=50) (Fig. 1D). These morphological characteristics were consistent with Botrytis cinerea (Ellis, 1971). The genes of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), heat shock protein (HSP60), DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit II (RPB2), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were amplified with specific primers ITS1/ITS4, HSP60-F/HSP60-R, RPB2-F/RPB2-R and G3PDH-F/G3PDH-R (Aktaruzzaman et al., 2022). Sequences were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers ON479490 for ITS, ON572246 for G3PDH, ON572248 for HSP60, ON572247 for RPB2. BLASTn analysis showed that the ITS sequence shared 99.62% similarity to B. cinerea (CP009808), and the sequences of the other three nuclear protein-encoding genes (G3PDH, HSP60, and RPB2) showed at least 99.9% identity with the genome of B. ci-nerea (B05.10) (Staats et al. 2005). We have inoculated 10 healthy A. philoxeroides leaves with a suspension of 1x105 spores/mL, and used sterile water treatment as control (Aktaruzzaman et al., 2022). Each leaf was inoculated with 10 \u03bcL spore sus-pension. After 7 days in a controlled incubation environment (25\u2103, 40%RH), the plants inoculated with conidial suspensions displayed lesions covered in a gray-white mycelial layer, resembling those observed in the field (Fig. 1E-G). In con-trast, the plants inoculated with sterile water remained unaffected. Morphological and PCR analysis confirmed that the pathogen responsible for the observed symp-toms was B. cinerea. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as the same pathogen was con-sistently re-isolated from the inoculated leaves and confirmed to be B. cinerea through morphological and molecular methods. This is the first reported case of B. cinerea causing gray mold on A. philoxeroides in China. It is important to monitor and prevent B. cinerea infection during cultivation to ensure the production of healthy Chinese medicine and feed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoding, China; z18715912135@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yuwei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoding , China; ljq1819366@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiaqi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Agricultural UniversityBaoding, China, 071001."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China; luqizhou_hbnd@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Luqi", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoding, China; H15832215606@163.com."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Nan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hebei Agricultural UniversityBaoding, China, 071000; bdzhaobin@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoding, China; liuyingchao@hebau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yingchao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38243183", "10.1094/PDIS-08-23-1668-PDN"]}}]}
