Charles Foster rats (150-200 gms of either sex) were divided into four groups as follows--Group 1 (n = 15) normal animals; Group II (n = 6) rats administered metoclopramide (1.35 mg/kg); Group III (n = 8) rats given atropine (0.45 mg/kg). These agents were injected intramuscularly, 30 mins before the experiment. Rats from Group IV (n = 8) were administered Terminalia chebula (100 mg/kg/day for 15 days orally). Metoclopramide and atropine have established prokinetic and antikinetic activities respectively and are therefore included for comparison. All rats were then given a test meal of methyl cellulose (1.5%) mixed with phenol red (50 mg/100 ml) orally and gastric emptying was measured 20 mins later. Gastric emptying of normal rats (Group I) was found to be 51.6 +/- 7.79%. Metoclopramide significantly increased the gastric emptying (76.33 +/- 12.37%; p < 0.01) and atropine inhibited the motility (% gastric emptying being 7.26 +/- 19.76%; p < 0.01). Terminalia chebula was found to increase the percent gastric emptying (86.57 +/- 6.65%; p < 0.01). Thus from this study it appears that Terminalia chebula can serve as an useful alternative to prokinetic drugs available today."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ayurveda Research Centre, Department of Pharmacology, Seth GS Medical College, Parel, Mumbai."}], "LastName": "Tamhane", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thorat", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rege", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dahanukar", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Postgrad Med", "NlmUniqueID": "2985196R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3859"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7C0697DR9I", "NameOfSubstance": "Atropine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L4YEB44I46", "NameOfSubstance": "Metoclopramide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Atropine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Emptying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Metoclopramide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10740705"]}}]}
