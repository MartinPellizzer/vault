The composite monolithic column was characterized <i>via</i> scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and mercury intrusion porosimetry. Subsequently, the composite monolithic column combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used as a solid-phase extraction (SPE) absorbent for online purification and enrichment of tectochrysin in medicinal plants. The results indicated that the addition of the ionic liquid and MOF not only increased the surface area but also increased the adsorption capacity of the monolith for tectochrysin. The method showed good linearity in the concentration range of 0.01-500 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The calibration equation was <i>y</i> = 2154.6<i>x</i> - 8.3785 and the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) and the limit of quantification (LOQ, S/N = 10) were 3.33 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and 10 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the intra-day and inter-day precision was less than 2.62%, the RSD of inter-column was less than 3.16%, and the recoveries ranged from 100.58% to 105.00%. Thus, results showed that this method is simple, accurate and convenient for the online enrichment and purification of tectochrysin from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yamei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yijie", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7636-2716"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Ligai", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6087-4426"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hongyuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0672-5091"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety of Hebei Province, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Diagnosis of Ministry of Education, Hebei University, Baoding, 071002, China. lhy1610@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Haiyan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9UBO28W2AK", "NameOfSubstance": "tectochrysin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35006229", "10.1039/d1ay01954f"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
