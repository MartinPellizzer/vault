The metastatic tendency in EC is associated with a poor prognosis. Our previous studies have demonstrated the suppressive effects of Andrographis paniculata water extract (APW) on metastatic esophageal cancer in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice models, as well as illustrated the potential underlying mechanism by transcriptome analysis.", "High expressions of several membrane protein tetraspanins were reported to lead to a high risk of metastasis in esophageal cancer in patients. We hypothesized that APW could downregulate the expression of tetraspanin CD81 in esophageal cancer cells and xenografts.", "Human esophageal cancer cells EC109 and KYSE520 were incubated with APW for 24 hours in cell culture, while mice bearing EC109 xenograft tumors were treated with APW for 21 days. The expressions of CD81 in cancer cells and in tumors from mice were evaluated. Molecular docking and microscale thermophoresis analyses were applied to identify the components in APW interacting with CD81. The influence of the identified components on CD81 expression was further evaluated in EC109 cells.", "APW could significantly suppress the expressions of CD81 in both EC109 and KYSE520 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of APW in xenograft-bearing mice reduces the metastasis in lungs, livers, and lymph nodes. The expression of CD81 in xenograft tumors of APW-treated mice was significantly lower than those of untreated control mice. The binding of andrographolide, bisandrographolide A, and bisandrographolide C with CD81 were elucidated by microscale thermophoresis. The suppressive effects of these compounds on the motility of EC109 cells, as well as CD81 protein and mRNA expressions, were further confirmed.", "This is the first time to demonstrate that andrographolide, bisandrographolide A, and bisandrographolide C, which are present in APW, bind to CD81 and suppress its function. These compounds are likely to be responsible for the anti-metastatic activities of APW in esophageal cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
