Public databases like TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource), Swissprot and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) were used for annotations of unigenes obtained.", "The transcriptome of E. jolkini generated 139,215 assembled transcripts with an average length of 868\u00a0bp and an N50 value of 1460\u00a0bp that were further clustered using CD-HIT into 93,801 unigenes with an average length of 847\u00a0bp (N50-1410\u00a0bp). Sixty-three percent of the coding sequences (CDS) were annotated from the longest open reading frame (ORF). A remarkable percentage of unigenes were annotated against various databases. The differentially expressed gene analysis revealed that the expression of genes related to the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway was higher in the flowers, whereas that of genes related to the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway was both up- and downregulated in flowers and leaves. A search of against the transcription factor domain found 1023 transcription factors (TFs) that were from 54 TF families.", "Assembled sequences of the E. jolkini transcriptome are made available for
