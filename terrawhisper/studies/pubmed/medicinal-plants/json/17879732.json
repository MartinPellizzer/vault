The former group were treated by Jiedu Tongluo Lishi decoction combined with SASP, the latter by MTX combined with SASP. The arthritis morning stiffness time, ache indexes, tumidness indexes, function indexes, hands grip, 20-m walking time and experimental indexes including ESR, RF, CRP, C3, immune globin of both groups were observed and compared.", "The obviously clinical effective ratio and the total clinical effective ratio in the former group were 77.78% and 90.74% respectively, which are better than those in the latter group (59.62% and 71.15% respectively) (P < 0.01). The arthritis morning stiffness time, ache indexes, tumidness indexes, function indexes, hands grip and 20-m walking time in both groups were obviously released after treatment (P < 0.01). The clinical release in the former group was better than that in the latter group (P < 0.05). ESR, RF and CRP in both groups were markedly improved (P < 0.05). The improvement of ESR, RF, CRP, C3 and IgA in the former group were better than those in the latter group (P < 0.05). The side effect includes gastroenteric tract reaction, decrease of leucocyte, abnormity of liver function, tetter and catamenia maladjustment.
