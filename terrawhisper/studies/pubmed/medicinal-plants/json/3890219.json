Linnaeus of Sweden devised the binomial classification of plants, which is still in use today. Boerhaave of Leyden revitalized bedside teaching and was a major influence in the English-speaking medical schools. Sloane founded the still-existing Physic Garden in London; his natural history collection formed the foundation of the British Museum. Withering prepared digitalis from the purple foxglove and wrote a standard work on the cultivation of vegetables. The gardenia and poinsettia are named after New World physician-botanists Alexander Garden and Joel Poinsett. Swedish physicians Sparrman and Thunberg, pupils of Linnaeus, were the major and original describers of the Cape flora. Atherstone of Grahamstown--the first doctor to use a general anaesthetic (ether) outside America and Europe--is a 19th century example of the naturalist physician as an ardent botanist; he was also a geologist and identified the first diamond found in South Africa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dubovsky", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Portrait"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "S Afr Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0404520"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Physicians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3890219"]}}]}
