The data indicated that fruiting bodies of these three mushroom species contained abundant nutritional substances. The protein contents of L. squarrosulus and O. submucida were 26.32% and 14.70%, which could be comparable to other commercially cultivated species. T. aurantialba contained 74.11% of carbohydrate, of which soluble polysaccharide was 40.55%. Oudemansiella sudmusida contained 15.95% of arabitol as the highest sugar alcohol in three mushrooms. These mushrooms also possessed distinct taste by their flavor component composition. Among them, L. squarrosulus contained 10.68% and 9.25% of monosodium glutamate-like and sweet amino acids, which were higher than the other two mushrooms. However, the nucleotide amounts of the three mushrooms were all lower than those of other commercially cultivated mushrooms. Among them, L. squarrosulus contained the highest amount of flavor nucleotides, which was 1.01\u2030. Results revealed that these three mushroom species are potentially suitable resources for commercial cultivation and healthy food."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi; Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding; Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Insitute of Edible Fungi,Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qing-Jiu", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi; Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding; and Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi; Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding; and Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chuan-hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi; Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Ministry of Agriculture; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding; and Institute of Edible Fungi, Shanghai Academy."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Insitute of Edible Fungi,Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi, Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources and Utilization, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Agricultural Genetics and Breeding, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry,Free University Berlin,Germany; and Insitute of Edible Fungi,Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences,National Engineering Research Center of Edible Fungi,Key Laboratory of Applied Mycological Resources."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing-Song", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruiting Bodies, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lentinula"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mycelium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25746405", "10.1615/intjmedmushrooms.v17.i1.50", "4c4b67436894c345,76ce48a3656451a2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
