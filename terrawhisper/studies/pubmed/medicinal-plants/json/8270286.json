Various anti-oxidants (ascorbic acid, cysteine and dithiothreitol) and adsorbents (activated charcoal and polyvinyl pyrrolidone) were used in different concentrations to prevent browning of the tissues. These in MS medium affected differently the growth, colour and texture of the tissues. It was concluded that both peroxidase and phenolase were involved in the browning. Increased peroxidase activity and decreased phenolase activity were probably due to more peroxidative oxidation of phenols and unavailability of substrate for phenolase activity. This resulted in faster growth of tissues, which further reduced the phenolase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, M L Sukhadia University, Udaipur, India."}], "LastName": "Bhardwaj", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramawat", "ForeName": "K G", "Initials": "KG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FZ989GH94E", "NameOfSubstance": "Povidone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8ID5YZU6Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Dithiothreitol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dithiothreitol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Povidone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8270286"]}}]}
