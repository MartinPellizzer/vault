Developing a nanoreactor with combined functions of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) that can simultaneously convert excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in tumors into O<sub>2</sub> required for type II PDT and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) for CDT can help achieve combined therapy. Here, we reported on a safe Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CNx nanoreactor with dual enzyme simulated activity, in which CNx sheet was the carrier and reducing agent to convert Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. After modified by MgO<sub>2</sub> and photosensitizer Ce6, MgO<sub>2</sub>-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/CNx-Ce6 (MFCC) platform integrated multiple functions, including photosensitizer delivery, compensated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> continuous supply, relieve of hypoxia, generation of \u2022OH and consumption of GSH into a single formulation. Under 660\u202fnm irradiation for 4\u202fmin, MFCC actives more ROS to conduct PDT/CDT, leading to the remarkable reduced survival rate of breast cancer cells to 14\u202f%. Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, MFCC can retain and accumulate at the tumor site of mice for a longer period that inhibit the expression of tumor angiogenic factors, suppress tumor neovascularization, and suppress the proliferation and growth of tumor cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
