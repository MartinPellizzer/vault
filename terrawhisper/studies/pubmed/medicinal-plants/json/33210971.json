Its dried roots are used for food, health care products, and medicine in China (Yuan et al. 2010). Root rot caused by Fusarium spp. was a major disease, with 33 to 41% incidence surveyed in main production areas of Wendeng County (121.80 \u00b0E, 37.09 \u00b0N) in Shandong Province, China in 2016 to 2019. Symptoms included soft, water-soaked, dark brown to black lesions on the roots. Lesions progressed and the inner parts gradually disintegrated. One-year-old diseased roots were collected in September 2016. Symptomatic tissues were surface-sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s and 0.8% NaOCl for 3 min, rinsed in sterile water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 25\u00b0C in darkness. Single colonies were then obtained and transferred to carnation leaf agar (CLA) (Burgess et al. 1993) for growth at 25\u00b0C with a 12-h photoperiod. Colonies cultured on PDA for 7 days were white to light pink, turning to apricot pigmentation in color. After 30 days on CLA, the colonies produced elongate, falcate macroconidia having 3 to 5 septa, with a long, tapering and curved apical cell, and having the size ranging from 31.1 to 45.6 \u03bcm long x 4 to 4.6 \u03bcm wide. Microconidia were zero to 1septate, ellipsoid to ovoid and varied in size from 9.5 to 16.8 \u03bcm long x 3 to 3.2 \u03bcm wide. Chlamydospores formed abundantly, in chains or clusters. This fungus was identified as F. armeniacum (Burgess et al. 1993). Identification was confirmed by sequencing three DNA regions including the internal spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS), elongation factor 1\u03b1 and \u03b2-tubulin genes (Lu et al. 2019). The three DNA regions (MN417271, MG457199, and MN427653) had 100% homology to the sequences of F. armeniacum (KJ737378, HM744664 and HQ141640) (Wang et al. 2015, Yli-Mattila et al. 2011). Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 1- to 2-year-old bare roots and 2-year-old whole plants. For root inoculation, 14 healthy roots were inoculated with two mycelial PDA plugs/root. After 3 to 10 days at 25\u00b0C, all the inoculated roots showed water-soaked and root rot symptoms while no lesions were observed in the control roots. For plant inoculation, eight seedlings planted in pots filled with sterilized soil were inoculated by pouring a conidial suspension of 1\u00d7105 conidia/ml at 30 ml/pot. Eight seedlings inoculated with sterilized water served as the controls. After 90 days, only 37.5% of the roots survived with typical root rot symptoms whereas the control plants remained symptomless. F. armeniacum was re-isolated from symptomatic roots but not from the control roots. Besides F. armeniacum, F. solani and F. oxysporum that have been reported to be associated with American ginseng root rot in China and Canada (Reeleder et al. 2002; Punja et al. 2008) were also obtained from the diseased root samples in this study. However, the development of root rot caused by F. armeniacum was much more rapid and its symptoms were more severe. Moreover, F. armeniacum could directly infect American ginseng with no wound requirement. F. armeniacum was previously reported on Glycine max (Leguminosae) (Ellis et al. 2012), Platycodon grandiflorus (Campanulaceae) (Wang et al. 2015) and natural grasses (Poaceae) (Nichea et al. 2015). This is the first report of F. armeniacum causing root rot on American ginseng in China. As this species is more virulent to American ginseng, more research is needed to work on this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing , China, Beijing, China, 100193; zhangximei2008@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ximei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing, China; biym1988@126.com."}], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Yanmeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing, China; ljf114129@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Junfei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing, China; 15232238185@163.com."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Huihui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No. 151 Malianwa North RoadHaidian DistrictBeijing, China, 100193; jiao_1110@163.com."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Xiao Lin", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, 198148, Malianwa North Road 151, Haidian District, Beijing, P.
