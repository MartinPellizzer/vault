Phytochemicals derived from natural products with the ability to improve adipocyte thermogenesis have aroused extensive attention. Acteoside (Act), a phenylethanoid glycoside, exists in various medicinal or edible plants and has been shown to regulate metabolic disorders. Here, the browning effect of Act was evaluated by stimulating beige cell differentiation from the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and by converting the iWAT-SVF derived mature white adipocytes. Act improves adipocyte browning by differentiation of the stem/progenitors into beige cells and by direct conversion of mature white adipocytes into beige cells. Mechanistically, Act inhibited CDK6 and mTOR, and consequently relieved phosphorylation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and increased its nuclear retention, leading to induction of PGC-1\u03b1, a driver of mitochondrial biogenesis, and UCP1-dependent browning. These data thus unveil a CDK6-mTORC1-TFEB pathway that regulates Act-induced adipocyte browning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
