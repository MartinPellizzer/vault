Sheep (23 wethers, 5 ewes) were assigned to 1 of 5 SW treatments (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 mg swainsonine/ kg bw/d). Swainsonine was delivered by feeding locoweed (Oxytropis sericea) with grama grass and alfalfa hays for a 28-d treatment period followed by a 21-d recovery period without locoweed. Body weights were measured weekly and behavioral changes were monitored for clinical signs of SW toxicity. Venous blood was collected weekly for lymphoblastogenesis and serum constituent analyses. Clinical signs (sluggishness, decreased responsiveness) of swainsonine toxicity were observed from d 14 to 35 in the 0.8 and 1.6 mg treatments. Subacute oral exposure did not appear to affect lymphoblastogenic analyses. Acute and subacute alterations in various serum constituents did indicate subclinical effects of SW ingestion. Linear, quadratic and cubic dose-response relationships were detected for some serum constituents (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase). Subacute SW consumption at the levels investigated does not seem to affect the immunocompetence of nutrient restricted sheep. The lack of change in serum alkaline phosphatase at the 0.2 mg SW/kg bw/d dose indicates the potential for a no adverse effect level of SW consumption in nutrient restricted sheep. In combination with measurable SW in serum, rises in serum alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and declines in serum Fe and cholesterol during subacute exposure to SW establish these markers as potential indicators of subclinical SW toxicosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Range Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces 88003, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taylor", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Strickland", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "May", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hawkins", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RSY4RK37KQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Swainsonine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "enzymology", "etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Swainsonine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10928681"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
