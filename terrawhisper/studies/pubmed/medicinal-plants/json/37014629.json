Herein, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@POP composite with a core-shell structure was constructed for the first time with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles as the core, 1,3,5-tris (4-aminophenyl) benzene (TAPB) and 2,5-divinylterephthalaldehyde (DVA) as organic monomers, and used as the support for immobilizing \u03b1-glucosidase. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@POP was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometry. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@POP exhibited a distinct core-shell structure and excellent magnetic response (45.2 emu g<sup>-1</sup>). \u03b1-Glucosidase was covalently immobilized on core-shell Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@POP magnetic nanoparticles using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking agent. The immobilized \u03b1-glucosidase possessed improved pH stability and thermal stability as well as good storage stability and reusability. More importantly, the immobilized enzyme exhibited a lower <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value and enhanced affinity for the substrate than the free one. The immobilized \u03b1-glucosidase was subsequently used for inhibitor screening from 18 traditional Chinese medicines in combination with capillary electrophoresis analysis among which <i>Rhodiola rosea</i> exhibited the highest enzyme inhibitory activity. These positive results demonstrated that such magnetic POP-based core-shell nanoparticles were a promising carrier for enzyme immobilization and the screening strategy based on immobilized enzyme provided an effective way to rapidly explore the targeted active compounds from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Guang-Zhen", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Gansu University of Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1844-0042"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Langmuir", "NlmUniqueID": "9882736", "ISSNLinking": "0743-7463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Porosity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetite Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37014629", "10.1021/acs.langmuir.2c02979"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
