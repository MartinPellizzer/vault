Thus, the purpose of this review is to emphasize the importance of flavonoids for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and put into the limelight of the scientific community several health-promoting effects of flavonoids which could be beneficial for the development of novel drugs from natural products. Despite available reviews on flavonoids targeting various disease conditions, a comprehensive review of flavonoids for autoimmune diseases is still lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to review the potential of flavonoids for autoimmune diseases. The structure-activity relationship of flavonoids in this review revealed that the rearrangement and introduction of other functional groups into the basic skeleton of flavonoids might lead to the development of new drugs which will be helpful in relieving the painful symptoms of various autoimmune diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
