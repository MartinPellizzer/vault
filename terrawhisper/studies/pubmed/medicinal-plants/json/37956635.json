(H. cordata; Saururaceae) is a medicine food homology plant that is grown in many Asian countries. Its main phytochemical constituents are volatile oils, flavonoids, polysaccharides and alkaloids. It has considerable clinical applications and health benefits.", "This paper reviews the existing literatures and patents, summarizes the phytochemistry, pharmacological activity, safety and economic botanical applications of H. cordata, and provides a reference for systematic study of the pharmacological effects of H. cordata, improvement of quality standards and further development of its medicinal resources.", "A comprehensive search of literature and patents on H. cordata and its active ingredients published before June 2023 was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and China Knowledge Network.", "H. cordata is not only edible and medicinal but also used in various aspects of daily life such as fermented beverages, nutraceuticals, feed and cosmetics. The main phytochemical constituents of H. cordata are volatile oils, flavonoids, organic acids and alkaloids. Several in vitro and in vivo studies and clinical trials have found that H. cordata extracts possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, hepatoprotective and renal, immunomodulatory and potent antiviral effects. The mechanisms of expression of these pharmacological effects are related to the blood-brain barrier, lipophilicity, cAMP signaling and skin permeability, including blocking the MAPK signaling pathway, inhibiting the secretion of inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, and activating the AMPK pathway.", "This paper provides a comprehensive review of the progress of research on the traditional applications, botany, chemical composition, pharmacological effects and safety of H. cordata and discusses for the first time the economic botanical aspects, which were not explored in the previous reviews. H. cordata has a wide range of bioactive substances whose therapeutic potential has not been fully exploited, and it could provide a new non-toxic approach to many diseases. This traditional medicinal food plant should receive more attention and in-depth research in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
