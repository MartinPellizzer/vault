For another 38 (36.2%) genuses, no research related to diuresis could be identified. Six (5.7%) genuses had mixed results in modern research, whereas a mere 5 (4.8%) genuses were shown to not have diuretic activity. Considering the 67 genuses that were investigated, 56 (83.6%) were confirmed.", "This analysis confirms that Dioscorides was accurate in determining the diuretic nature of herbs, raising the possibility that he was right about other therapeutic suggestions concerning herbs he made. For the remaining herbs that have not been assessed for diuretic effect, it is not yet known if Dioscorides was accurate. Our findings suggest that the 38 herbs Dioscorides categorized as diuretics that have not been studied for diuretic function are candidates for research in this regard."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Botanical Medicine, School of Naturopathic Medicine, Bastyr University, Kenmore, Washington."}], "LastName": "Yarnell", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Washington, District of Columbia."}], "LastName": "Touwaide", "ForeName": "Alain", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30403493", "10.1089/acm.2018.0251"]}}]}
