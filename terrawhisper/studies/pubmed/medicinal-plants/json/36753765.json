G. Lee et C. F. Liang is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant distributed in Guangxi and Yunnan Province, China. In May 2021, a leaf blight disease on C. kwangsiensi was observed in a plantation (~ 2 ha) in Lingshan county (21\u00b051'00\u2033N, 108\u00b044'00\u2033E), Guangxi Province. Disease incidence was up to 30% (n = 200). Initially, yellow to brown, irregular, water-soaked spots appeared at the tips or margins of leaves. As the disease progressed, the lesions gradually enlarged, merged. Finally, the entire leaf wilted, leading to defoliation. To isolate the pathogen, eighteen small pieces ( ~ 5 mm2) were cut from the margin of the necrotic lesions, surface disinfected with 1% NaOCl solution for 2 min, and rinsed three times in sterile water. Then the tissues were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated for 3 days at 28\u00b0C. Hyphal tips from recently germinated spores were transferred to PDA to obtain pure cultures. Twelve isolates were obtained, of which ten isolates with similar morphological characterization. Two single-spore isolates (CK45.1 and CK45.2) were subjected to further morphological and molecular characterization. Colonies on PDA were villose, had a dense growth of aerial mycelia, and appeared white to grayish eventually. Pycnidia were brown, predominantly spheroidal, and 45.0 to 205.4 \u03bcm in diameter (n = 60). Conidia were ellipsoidal, aseptate, and 3.8 to 6.1 \u00d7 1.8 to 3.6 \u03bcm (n = 90). Morphological characteristics are similar to those of Epicoccum latusicollum (Chen et al. 2017).For molecular identification, primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), LR0R/LR5 (Vilgalys and Hester 1990, Rehner and Samuels 1994), RPB2-Ep-F (GGTCTTGTGTGCCCCGCTGAGAC)/RPB2-Ep-R TCGGGTGACATGACAATCATGGC), and TUB2-Ep-F (GTTCACCTTCAAACCGGTCAATG)/TUB2-Ep-R (AAGTTGTCGGGACGGAAGAGCTG) were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), partial nuclear large subunit rDNA (LSU), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2), and \u03b2-tubulin (tub2) genes, respectively. The obtained ITS (OP788080-81), LSU (OP811325-26), rpb2 (OP811267-68) and tub2 (OP811269-70) sequences showed 99.8% (478/479, and 478/479 bp), 99.9% (881/882, and 870/871 bp), 99.8 to 100% (429/431, and 429/430 bp), and 99.7% (332/333, and 332/333 bp) identity with those of ex-type strain E. latusicollum CGMCC 3.18346 (KY742101, KY742255, KY742174, KY742343). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis confirmed the isolates as E. latusicollum. Therefore, based on morphological and molecular characteristics, the isolates were identified as E. latusicollum. To verify pathogenicity, healthy leaves on nine plants (1 leaf per plant) were inoculated with mycelial discs from 5-day-old water-agar medium (WA) cultures of the strain CK45.1. Each leaf had four inoculation sites, two were inoculated with a representative strain, and two treated with pollution-free WA discs served as control. Plants were covered with transparent plastic bags and maintained in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C with a 12 h photoperiod. Six days post-inoculation, the inoculated sites of leaves showed brown lesions, while the control remained healthy. The experiments repeated three times showed similar results. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-isolation of E. latusicollum from the lesions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. latusicollum causing leaf blight of C. kwangsiensi in China. This report might provide important information for growers to manage this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, Guangxi Province, China; 1351395450@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hanyi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Science, 125388, Biotechnology Research Institute, Nanning, Guangxi, China; shiyunping@163.com."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yun Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, China; 2115350968@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Siyu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, China; 849224815@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ze", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Guangxi Minzu University, Nanning, China; 1363431724@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jingyi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, China; 330660726@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Xiuming", "ForeName": "Hou", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, China; hzliao@gxmzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Hongze", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, China; qigao_qg@foxmail.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Guangxi Key Laboratory for Polysaccharide Materials and Modifications, Nanning, Guangxi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Minzu University, Key Laboratory of Protection and Utilization of Marine Resources, Nanning, China; zhou.hao.gxun@foxmail.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36753765", "10.1094/PDIS-11-22-2668-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
