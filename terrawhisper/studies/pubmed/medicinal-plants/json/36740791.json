They were evaluated for inhibitory activity against C. albicans, E. coli, and S. aureus. Among them, thirty compounds exhibited moderate to excellent antibacterial activity.", "The maximum circle of inhibition was 18 mm (compounds B15, B16, and E7), and the minimum values of MIC and MBC were respectively 15.625 \u03bcM (compounds A5 and D2) and 62.5 \u03bcM (compounds A6, A8, and E7).", "The SAR showed that aurone and indanone derivatives could strongly inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups or hydroxyl is beneficial to the activity. It was exciting that the 3-phenylallylbenzofuranone and 3-allylindanone skeletons with antimicrobial activity were first reported in this study. Compounds A5 and E7 were selected for molecular docking studies with targets MetRS (PBD: 7WPI) and PBP (PDB: 6C3K) to determine the binding interactions at the active site.", "On this basis, the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of the compounds were predicted and analyzed. The influence of these properties on antimicrobial activity and their implications for subsequent work were discussed. The ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) predictions showed that most of the compounds had good pharmacokinetic profiles and high safety profiles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Haiqing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Baoxing", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "aurone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36740791", "10.2174/1573406419666230203105246", "MC-EPUB-129271"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
