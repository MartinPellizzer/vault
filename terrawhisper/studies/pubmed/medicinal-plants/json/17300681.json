Interindividual differences in P-gp activity could modulate susceptibility to cancer development. The MDR1 gene, coding for P-gp, is highly polymorphic and some mutations modulate P-gp activity. Recently, association between the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and the cancer susceptibility was shown. We have hypothesized that MDR1 polymorphism could influence endometrial cancer susceptibility. We have matched 198 women with endometrial cancer and 198 controls. An additional group of 488 healthy volunteers was investigated. The MDR1 C3435T polymorphism was tested by LightCycler assay. The distribution of MDR1 3435 genotypes was significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.006). Genotypes containing at least one 3435T allele were statistically significant more frequent in the endometrial cancer group (86.8% vs 75.2%, OR 2.18, P = 0.004). Our observation suggests that MDR1 C3435T polymorphism is correlated with endometrial cancer susceptibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Biotechnology, Research Institute of Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland. pmm@post.pl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Semczuk", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Landt", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Breborowicz", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drews", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Gynecol Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "9111626", "ISSNLinking": "1048-891X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Endometrial Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Point Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17300681", "10.1111/j.1525-1438.2007.00821.x", "IJG821"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
