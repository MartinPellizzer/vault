The use of soil microbes is among the most efficient methods for treating heavy-metal polluted soils. The objective was to investigate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Glomus mosseae) on the nutrient uptake (N, P, K, Fe, and Mn,) and Cd removal of different plants including rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), amaranth (Amaranthus sp.), and ornamental cabbage (Brassica oleracea) in a Cd-polluted soil. The experiment was a three-way factorial on the basis of a randomized complete block design with three replicates. The experimental soil was sprayed with Cd (0, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and after 2 months it was inoculated with 100\u00a0g of mycorrhizal inoculums, and was planted in 4-kg pots. Plant growth (root and aerial part) and nutrient uptake as well as Cd removal from the contaminated soil were significantly affected by the experimental treatments. AM fungi significantly increased plant P uptake (35%) compared with N (24%), K (4%), Fe (24%) and Mn (13%). According to the results, rosemary was the most effective plant for the bioremediation of the soil. There were significant differences between plant roots and aerial part in terms of plant nutrient uptake and phytoremediation potential. Although increasing Cd concentration decreased plant growth and nutrient uptake, mycorrhizal fungi was able to alleviate the stress by significantly increasing plant growth, nutrient uptake and phytoremediation potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
