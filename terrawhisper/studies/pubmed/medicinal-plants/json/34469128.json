Microbial remediation is a popular approach to relieve these negative impacts, but the associated molecular mechanisms are rarely explored. Nitrile hydratase (NHase), an enzyme commonly used in industry for amide production, was discovered to be responsible for the degradation of acetamiprid (ACE) and thiacloprid (THI) by microbes. Since then, research into NHases in NEO degradation has attracted increasing attention. In this review, microbial degradation of ACE and THI is briefly described. We then focus on NHase evolution, gene composition, maturation mechanisms, expression, and biochemical properties with regard to application of NHases in NEO degradation for bioremediation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3784-199X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province and School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Shilei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8822-4580"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province and School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jiangsheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province and School of Life Science, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jihong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Microbes and Functional Genomics, Jiangsu Engineering and Technology Research Center for Industrialization of Microbial Resources, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Yijun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Miaomiao", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neonicotinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5HL5N372P0", "NameOfSubstance": "acetamiprid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DSV3A944A4", "NameOfSubstance": "thiacloprid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydro-Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrile hydratase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydro-Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neonicotinoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitriles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiazines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34469128", "10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03496"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
