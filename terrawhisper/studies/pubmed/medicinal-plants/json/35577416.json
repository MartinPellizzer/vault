Virtual screening was conducted for the hypothetical library using <i>in silico</i> docking, ADMET, and toxicity studies. Four compounds exhibited high <i>in silico</i> affinity against VEGFR-2 and an acceptable range of the drug-likeness. These compounds were synthesised and subjected to <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> cytotoxicity assay against two cancer cell lines besides VEGFR-2 inhibitory determination. Compound <b>D-1</b> showed cytotoxic activity against HCT-116 cells almost double that of sorafenib. Compounds <b>A-1</b>, <b>C-6</b>, and <b>D-1</b> showed good IC<sub>50</sub> values against VEGFR-2. Compound <b>D-1</b> markedly increased the levels of caspase-8 and BAX expression and decreased the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 level. Additionally, compound <b>D-1</b> caused cell cycle arrest at pre-G1 and G2-M phases in HCT-116 cells and induced apoptosis at both early and late apoptotic stages.
