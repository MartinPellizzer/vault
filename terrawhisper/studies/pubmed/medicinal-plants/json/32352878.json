Total bioactive contents were determined spectrophotometrically, and the individual secondary metabolites composition was assessed <i>via</i> ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) analysis. Antioxidant capacities were evaluated using a panoply of assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical scavenging, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant power (CUPRAC), phosphomolybdenum total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and metal chelating activity (MCA)). The enzyme inhibition potential was studied against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, tyrosinase, urease and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. The methanol extract was found to contain higher total phenolic (105.91\u2009mg GAE/g extract) and flavonoid (2.27\u2009mg RE/g extract) contents which can be correlated to its more substantial antioxidant potential as well as AChE, BChE, tyrosinase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition. However, the DCM extract was the most effective against \u03b1-amylase (1.86\u2009mmol ACAE/g extract) enzyme inhibition. The UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extract identified the tentative presence of a total of 18 secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, saponins, phenolic and terpenoid derivatives. Three compounds named emmotin A, luteolin 5,3'-dimethyl ether, and preferrugone were further investigated for their <i>in silico</i> molecular docking studies against the tested enzymes. The selected compounds were found to have higher binding interaction with AChE followed by BChE, \u03b1-glucosidase, \u03b1-amylase, and tyrosinase. The results of the present study have demonstrated <i>A. mauroram</i> to be considered as a lead source of natural antioxidant and enzyme inhibitor compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University, Selangor, Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Hammad", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Al Ain University, Al Ain, UAE."}], "LastName": "Sarfraz", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Kashif Maqbool", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Centre, PCSIR Laboratories Complex, Karachi, Paksitan."}], "LastName": "Anwar", "ForeName": "Muhammad Aijaz", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5165-6013"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Irshad", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shafi-Ullah", "Initials": "SU"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3962-8666"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, Da Nang, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Mohamad Fawzi", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ahemad", "ForeName": "Nafees", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32352878", "10.1080/03639045.2020.1762199"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
