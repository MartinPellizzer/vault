A recent survey has demonstrated that traditional healers and herbalists frequently use this plant to treat diabetes. In the current study, the traditional medicine was prepared as a tea, and the profile of the main metabolites present in the traditional medicine was analysed via LC/MS/MS. The extract was shown to contain a number of phenolic glycosides including quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-glycoside, kaempferol-3(6'-malonylglucoside), isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside, and isorhamnetin 3-(6\u2033-malonylglucoside) in addition to two unidentified sulphonated saponins. The traditional medicine inhibits <i>\u03b1</i>-glucosidase <i>in vitro</i> with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.62\u2009\u00b5g/mL. The hypoglycaemic effect of the traditional medicine was evaluated in normoglycaemic and streptozotocin-treated diabetic rats, using glibenclamide as an internal control. The preparation (250 or 500\u2009mg/kg body weight) was administered once a day for 21\u00a0consecutive days. The dose of 500\u2009mg/kg was effective in the management of the disease, causing a 45\u200a% decrease in the plasma glucose level at the end of the experimental period. Histological analysis of pancreatic sections confirmed that streptozotocin/nictotinamide treatment caused destruction of pancreatic islet cells, while pancreatic sections from the treatment groups showed that both the extract and glibenclamide partially prevented this deterioration. The mechanism of this protective effect is unclear. However, such a finding suggests that ingestion of the tea could confer additional benefits and should be investigated further."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and Trinity Biosciences Institute (TBSI), Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Nazir", "ForeName": "Imran", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ur Rahman", "ForeName": "Nisar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alvi", "ForeName": "Zunaira", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hafizur Rahman", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, M\u00fcnster, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sendker", "ForeName": "Jandirk", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and Trinity Biosciences Institute (TBSI), Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and Trinity Biosciences Institute (TBSI), Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Frankish", "ForeName": "Neil", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trinity College Dublin, School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences and Trinity Biosciences Institute (TBSI), Dublin, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Sheridan", "ForeName": "Helen", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Planta Med. 2017 Oct;83(14-15):E3. doi: 10.1055/s-0043-109620", "PMID": "28476067"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zygophyllaceae"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28388787", "10.1055/s-0043-107616"]}}]}
