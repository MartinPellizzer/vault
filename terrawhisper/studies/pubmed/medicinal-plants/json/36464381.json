Given the role of iron in paraquat (PQ) toxicity, the present study investigated the effectiveness of phlebotomy in PQ pulmonary toxicity. After conducting preliminary studies, the duration time of phlebotomy was set to be seven days. Then, the mice were divided into nine separate groups. Groups 1-3 received a single dose of normal saline, and 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg of PQ, respectively, and phlebotomy was not performed on them (NPG status). The animals in groups 4-6 first underwent phlebotomy for seven days and then received a single dose of normal saline, and 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg of PQ (PBPT status). Groups 7-9 first received a single dose of normal saline, and 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg of PQ and then underwent phlebotomy for seven days (PAPT status). Seven days after acute exposure to PQ, the animals were anesthetized and biochemical biomarkers as well as lung tissue changes were evaluated. The findings showed that phlebotomy before and after PQ toxicity significantly decreased serum iron compared to NPG condition. In the PBPT status, phlebotomy could prevent PQ toxicity by increasing the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreasing the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the levels of hydroxyproline and lipid peroxidation in the lung tissue. In the PAPT status, a significant improvement was observed in SOD and MPO activities compared to the NPG status. Confirming the biochemical findings, the histological results indicated higher effectiveness of phlebotomy in preventing PQ toxicity (PBPT) compared to its therapeutic effects (PAPT). Considering the role of iron in PQ toxicity, it appears that the reduction of serum iron levels during phlebotomy can be effective in preventing lung injuries caused by PQ and improving the performance of the pulmonary antioxidant system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
