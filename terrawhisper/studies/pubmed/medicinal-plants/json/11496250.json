We sought to evaluate the clinical and immunologic reactivity to lupine in employees working with this seed flour. An occupational history was obtained in 7 subjects (median age, 35 years) working with LSF at an agricultural research center. Three subjects (1, 6, and 7) reported work-related allergy symptoms immediately after being exposed to lupine. Skin prick test results with LSF extract were positive in these 3 patients with work-related symptoms. Moreover, lupine-specific IgE antibodies were detected in subjects 6 and 7. In subject 6, the controlled exposure to LSF elicited immediate naso-ocular symptoms without changes in FEV(1). In subject 7, a bronchial provocation with LSF extract elicited an immediate fall (25%) in FEV(1). Double-blinded, placebo-controlled LSF oral challenge results were positive in subjects 6 and 7. Immunologic reactivity to other legumes was detected in subjects 6 and 7, but specific inhalation testing and oral challenge results were negative. Thus, the inhalation of lupine flour could be an important cause of allergic sensitization in exposed workers and might give rise to occupational asthma and food allergy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Servicio de Alergia, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crespo", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vives", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "James", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rea\u00f1o", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Daroca", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burbano", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Muzquiz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Immediate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical Laboratory Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11496250", "10.1067/mai.2001.116860", "S0091674901760472"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
