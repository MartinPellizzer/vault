Secondary measures included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale, and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales (CGI-S and CGI-I).", "The random coefficient analyses for the HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-S, and CGI-I all showed significant effects for time but not for treatment or time-by-treatment interaction (for HAM-D scores, P<.001, P =.16, and P =.58, respectively). Analysis of covariance showed nonsignificant effects for BDI and GAF scores. The proportion of participants achieving an a priori definition of response did not differ between groups. The number reaching remission of illness was significantly higher with St John's wort than with placebo (P =.02), but the rates were very low in the full intention-to-treat analysis (14/98 [14.3%] vs 5/102 [4.9%], respectively). St John's wort was safe and well tolerated. Headache was the only adverse event that occurred with greater frequency with St John's wort than placebo (39/95 [41%] vs 25/100 [25%], respectively).", "In this study, St John's wort was not effective for treatment of major depression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville Tennessee, USA. richard.shelton@mcmail.vanderbilt.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shelton", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keller", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gelenberg", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dunner", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirschfeld", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thase", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lydiard", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Crits-Cristoph", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallop", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Todd", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hellerstein", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goodnick", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keitner", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stahl", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Halbreich", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01 MH061590", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "K24-MH01741", "Acronym": "MH", "Agency": "NIMH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "JAMA", "NlmUniqueID": "7501160", "ISSNLinking": "0098-7484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "ACP J Club. 2001 Nov-Dec;135(3):103"}, {"RefSource": "JAMA. 2001 Jul 4;286(1):42; author reply 44-5.", "PMID": "11434815"}, {"RefSource": "JAMA. 2001 Jul 4;286(1):42; author reply 44-5.", "PMID": "11434816"}, {"RefSource": "JAMA. 2001 Jul 4;286(1):42-3; author reply 44-5.", "PMID": "11434817"}, {"RefSource": "JAMA. 2001 Jul 4;286(1):43; author reply 44-5.", "PMID": "11434818"}, {"RefSource": "JAMA. 2001 Jul 4;286(1):43-5.", "PMID": "11434819"}, {"RefSource": "Evid Based Ment Health. 2002 Feb;5(1):24. doi: 10.1136/ebmh.5.1.24", "PMID": "11915827"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder, Major"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11308434", "10.1001/jama.285.15.1978", "joc02013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
