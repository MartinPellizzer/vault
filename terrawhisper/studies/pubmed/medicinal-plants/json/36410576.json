Among the 60 different accepted species, nearly every plant part of the genus (bark, fruit, latex, leaf, leaf sap, root, rootbark, twig) from 13 species is utilized by traditional healers around Africa. Accordingly, many pharmacological studies (42) were performed on the most common species (11).", "This comprehensive literature review summarizes all publications dealing on one of the 60 plant species from the genus Landolphia. An overview about already performed analysis is given and important aspects and knowledge gaps are highlighted for the direction of future research activities.", "A systematic web search taking into account the major platforms Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, SciFinder and Google Scholar was performed for the term Landolphia. All relevant datasets, published between 1804 and 2022, were ordered according to their topics in different sections and compared to each other. A network visualization of the keywords via VOS Viewer was additionally performed.", "In total, 209 publications were retrieved from the search engines, mainly written in English. Predominant are ethnopharmacological studies, which identified 292 phytochemicals in plant parts of the whole genus. Diverse biological activities were detected in different plant extracts, and five species were determined as of special interest for the treatment of malaria. Further research topics identified are botanical aspects, ethnobotanical utilizations, ecological aspects, the potential as source for human and animal nutrition, the manufacturing of rubber, economic aspects, biomechanical studies and others. L. owariensis is the most studied plant as it is abundant in continental Africa.", "This review serves as a database for upcoming research on the genus Landolphia and directs existing knowledge gaps. A wide range of chemical components are already identified, but their exact content in the respective plant parts and their biological activity remains mainly unknown. Utilization patterns from traditional medicine are only partially analyzed as demonstrated for the applications as aphrodisiac, to treat skin diseases or as antidiabetic. Nutritional analyses likewise focus on several species of Landolphia and lack for the wide range of known edible fruits. The demand for new natural products in terms of medicine, rubber and nutrition is still high and the genus Landolphia seems to be a promising resource covering many aspects at once."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
