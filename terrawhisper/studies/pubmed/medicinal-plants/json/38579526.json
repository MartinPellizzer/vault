The Animal Plant and Soil Traces expert working group of the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes in their best practice manual has recommended several markers for plant species identification. Current study is a part of implementation of method in a forensic laboratory and its aim is to evaluate four of the recommended markers (ITS, matK, rbcL, and trnH-psbA) for species identification of forensically important plant species including medicinal, poisonous, psychoactive, and other plants. Such parameters as PCR and sequencing success, sequence length, species resolution rate and species cover in GenBank were analysed. Blind testing was performed to evaluate use of the markers for identification of forensically more complicated samples. According to results, a combination of ITS, matK and trnH-psbA is the best choice for plant species identification. The best results with fresh plant material can be achieved with ITS, trnH-psbA, and matK, while ITS and matK are the best choice when working with low quality plant material. rbcL due to its low species discrimination rate can be used only as an indicative marker."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
