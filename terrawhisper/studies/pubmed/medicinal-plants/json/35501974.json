Though several treatments have been developed to protect nerves, comprehensive improvement of MS is still considered an essential bottleneck. Therefore, the development of innovative treatment methods for MS is one of the core research areas. In this regard, nanoscale platforms can offer practical and ideal approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, especially immunological disorders such as MS, to improve the effectiveness of conventional therapies. It should be noted that there is significant progress in the development of neuroprotective strategies through the implementation of various nanoparticles, monoclonal antibodies, peptides, and aptamers. In this study, we summarize different particle systems as well as targeted therapies, such as antibodies, peptides, nucleic acids, and engineered cells for the treatment of MS, and discuss their potential in the treatment of MS in the preclinical and clinical stages. Future advances in targeted delivery of medical supplies may offer new strategies for complete recovery as well as practical treatment of progressive forms of MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Science, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jan", "ForeName": "Zeinab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, F82C+G8V Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6314-0164"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abnous", "ForeName": "Khalil", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9836-2189"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taghdisi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Science, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Danesh", "ForeName": "Abolghasem", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6080-7015"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, 7GJP+VPQ Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alibolandi", "ForeName": "Mona", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "101197791", "ISSNLinking": "1543-8384"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35501974", "10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.1c00892"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
