Apart from its effects on glucose level, insulin has an important role in the reproductive system directly by binding on insulin and IGF receptors in the brain and testis. To date, however, the effect of insulin or its alterations on blood-testis-barrier, as an important regulator of normal spermatogenesis and fertility, has not yet been studied. This review aimed to focus on the experimental and clinical studies to describe mechanisms by which insulin affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, testicular cells, spermatozoa, and sexual behavior. Moreover, we discussed the mechanism and impact of insulin changes in type 1 (insulin deficiency along with persisted or even increased sensitivity) and 2 (insulin resistance along with increased insulin level at the early stages of disease) diabetes and obesity on the male reproductive tract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
