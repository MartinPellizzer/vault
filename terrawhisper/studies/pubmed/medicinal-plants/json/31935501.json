Many species of this genus are widely used in traditional medicine and have important cultural value in East Asia. Among them, C. longa is considered to be the main source of curcumin and has a very wide range of uses. The rapid development of molecular phylogeny has deepened our understanding of taxonomy and evolution of Curcuma. However, little is known about the chloroplast genome phylogeny and the genetic bases of adaptative evolution. In this work, we sequenced the complete chloroplast genome of 4 Curcuma species. Curcuma chloroplast genomes showed highly conserved structures and the length ranged from 159,423\u00a0bp to 152,723\u00a0bp. A total of 133 genes were observed. Multiple repeats and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. By comparing with related species, 7 highly variable regions were identified as potential specific DNA barcodes for species identification. Phylogenetic analysis of complete plastome sequences and specific data sets revealed discordance with expected genus boundary. Chloroplast phylogenetic relationships were better predicted by geography than by morphological and nuclear DNA, indicating a substantial existence of introgression. 9 genes were proved to have high posteriori probability in positive selection analysis, and 4 of them (psbA, psbD, PetA and rbcL) closely related to photosynthesis, implying that chloroplast genes may had undergone positive selection pressure in evolution. These results are of great significance for us to understand the genetic basis, phylogeny and adaptive evolution of Curcuma chloroplast."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
