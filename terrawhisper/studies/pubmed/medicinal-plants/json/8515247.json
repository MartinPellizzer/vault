Forty-four Pekin ducklings were inoculated intraperitoneally with DHBV at 24 hr post-hatch. They were treated by intraperitoneal injection of Phyllanthus amarus (aqueous extract) (100 mg/kg body weight) or Phyllanthus mad eraspatensis (alcoholic extract) (100 mg/kg body weight) for a period of 4 weeks. Infected ducklings treated with saline served as controls. Weekly serum samples obtained before, during, and after treatment were analysed for the presence of DHBV DNA in serum by dot blot hybridisation using alpha 32P-labelled probes. Liver tissue was collected after killing the ducks at various time intervals and was studied for replicative status of the viral DNA and liver histopathology; 17 of 21 ducks were viraemic on completion of treatment with Phyllanthus amarus. At 16 week posttreatment follow-up four of seven animals remained viraemic. Similar results were obtained with Phyllanthus maderaspatensis. There was no alteration in DHBV replication in the liver. No toxicity was observed with this treatment. These observations suggest that Phyllanthus amarus and Phyllanthus maderaspatensis are not useful as therapeutic agents for postexposure prophylaxis against DHBV infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi."}], "LastName": "Munshi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mehrotra", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Panda", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705876", "ISSNLinking": "0146-6615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Probes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Southern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Probes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ducks"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B Virus, Duck"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis, Viral, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Viremia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8515247", "10.1002/jmv.1890400111"]}}]}
