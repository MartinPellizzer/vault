The administration of chemical anthelmintic drugs (AH) is the common method of deworming; however, generates resistance in the parasites to AH and it is a public health risk due to drug residues in milk, meat and sub-products. Natural compounds from plants are explored to diminish this parasitosis, improving their health and productivity, without the negative effects of AH. Ipomoea genus is a group of climbing plants belonging to the Convulvulaceae family possessing perennial leaves and tuberous roots. Medicinal properties has been attributed to this plant including nutritional agents, emetics, diuretics, diaphoretics, purgatives and pesticides. The objective of this study was assessing the in vitro nematocidal activity of a hydroalcoholic extract (HA-E) obtained from Ipomoea pauciflora (Cazahuate) flowers against Hc infective larvae (L3) and to identify its phytochemical profile (PhC-P). The assay was carried out using microtiter plates (MTP). Four HA-E concentrations were assessed and Ivermectin and distilled water were used as positive and negative control groups, respectively. Approximately 100 Hc L3 were deposited in each well (n=12) and incubated at 25-35\u00b0C for 7 days. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and a General Linear Model (GLM) followed by Tukey test (P<0.05). The treatments showing a concentration-dependent effect (CDE) were analyzed to identify their 50% and 90% lethal concentrations (CL50, 90) via a Probit Analysis. The highest mortality was observed at 50 mg/mL (82.64 \u00b1 0.71%) and the lowest at 6.25 mg/mL (56.46 \u00b1 2.49%), showing a CDE with increasing mortality from 6.25 to 50 mg/mL. The PhC-P revealed the presence of alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, tannins and triterpenes/ sterols. A HA-E from flowers of I. pauciflora will be considered to assess its potential use in the control of haemonchosis in small ruminants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agricultural, Livestock and Environmental Sciences, Autonomous University of Guerrero, Iguala, Guerrero, Mexico, CP 40040."}], "LastName": "Delgado-N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Disciplinary Research in Animal Health and Safety.
