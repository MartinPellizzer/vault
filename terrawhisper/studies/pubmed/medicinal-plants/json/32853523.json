Using 2-bromo-1-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-ethaone (BrDPE) as the tagging reagent, a previously unexploited <i>N</i>-alkylpyrimidine derivative (Nad) was created for one-pot labeling of widescope nucleobases via a flexible bromophilic substitution under mild conditions. The derivatization notably improved the LC-MS detection sensitivity by 31-107 fold, enabling a fast dilute-and-shoot analysis of highly diluted samples. The optimized and validated method demonstrated satisfactory accuracy (87-107%), precision (RSDs < 7.5%), and recovery (89-105%) for matrix-matched standard addition. The method was applied to simultaneously determine all target analytes and four uncanonical analogues and base-modified species in seven traditional health foods, which differ in contents by up to 600-fold for discrimination among samples. Further, the base-labeled Nads exhibit a unique fragmentation signature that could be used for untargeted screening of nucleobase-containing metabolites by simplified LC-MS/MS workflow to improve quality evaluation of natural medicinal products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xingrong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Lijuan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha 410083, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meiling", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bowen", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8194-9669"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Phytochemical R&D of Hunan Province, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Research (Ministry of Education of China), Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410081, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyribonucleosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyribonucleosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32853523", "10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03328"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
