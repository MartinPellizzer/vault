KLO at 500\u202fppm showed potential activity against X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Among the major components identified, citronellal (CIT) at 75\u202f\u03bcM concentration was found to significantly inhibit biofilm along with the swimming and swarming potential of X. oryzae pv. oryzae. In contrary, CIT did not affect the metabolic status and growth kinetics of the bacterial cells. Gene expression analysis showed down regulation in motA, cheD, cheY, flgF, gumC, xylanase, endogluconase, cellulose, cellobiosidase, virulence and rpfF transcript levels by citronellal treatment. However, an insignificant effect of 75\u202f\u03bcM CIT treatment was observed on motB, flgE, pilA, estY, pglA, protease and lytic genes expression. Finally, the observations recorded were in confirmity with the virulence leaf clip test as lesion length was significantly decreased (39%) in CIT treatment as compared to the control leaves inoculated with only X. oryzae pv. oryzae. Overall, the findings obtained advocate the use of CIT for promising anti biofilm and anti virulence activity which in turn can be used for managing the blight disease in rice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
