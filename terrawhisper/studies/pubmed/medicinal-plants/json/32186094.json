The ability to load and release he anticancer drug into/from the synthesized hyperbranched polyester was evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The successful synthesis of CENL was supported by analytical techniques including fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and dynamic light scattering. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide color method. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using a dichlorofluorescein probe and intracellular calcium (Cai2+) was evaluated with a flu3-AM probe.", "The results showed that the drug delivery system is stable and that the loading capacity is high. Treatment with nanoparticles containing luteolin and free luteolin resulted in cell death in breast cancer cells at high concentrations [IC50 (33 \u00b1 4) and (48 \u00b1 6) \u03bcM, respectively]. At high concentrations, CENL reduced cell viability and increased ROS and Cai2+ production.", "Our results demonstrate that CENL has potential for human breast cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahin", "ForeName": "Maleki", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Aidy", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Elahe", "ForeName": "Karimi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naser", "ForeName": "Abbasi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Ilam Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Elahe", "ForeName": "Karimi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shaahin", "ForeName": "Shahbazi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nader", "ForeName": "Safarian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naser", "ForeName": "Abbasi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Tradit Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8211546", "ISSNLinking": "0255-2922"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32186094", "2933"]}}]}
