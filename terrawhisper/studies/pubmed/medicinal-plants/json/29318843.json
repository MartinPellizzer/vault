Based on investigation and field investigation, the samples and distribution information of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus were collected. Based on the data of four kinds of lignin chemical constituents, ecological environment factors and spatial distribution data of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, using GIS technology, maximum information entropy model and SPSS statistical analysis method for regionalizing the quality of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus. The results showed that Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus was mainly distributed in the northeast of Liaoning, east of Jilin, east of Heilongjiang. The content of schisandrin was higher in the samples from northeastern part of Jilin province and the northeastern part of Liaoning province, The content of deoxyschizandrin was higher in the samples from middle of Jilin province and northeastern Hebei province, where the content of schisandrin B was higher in the samples from Jilin area, The higher schisantherin A sample were from southeast of Jilin and northeast of Liaoning. Considering the content of four components in Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus, the quality of Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus was concentrated in the southeast of Jilin and the northeastern part of Liaoning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jing-Lei", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resources Center for Chinese Materia, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jilin Province Changnong Industrial Company Limited, Changchun 130000, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Cui", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resources Center for Chinese Materia, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Ying-Qiao", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Changchun 130117, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Schisandra"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318843", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0192"]}}]}
