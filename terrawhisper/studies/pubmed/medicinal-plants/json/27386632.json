The tibial bone defect group served as the control group. The experimental groups were Potentilla fulgens with tibial defect (14 days) and Potentilla fulgens with tibial defect (28 days). Extract of Potentilla fulgens was mixed with water (400 mg/kg/day) and given to groups 14 and 28 as drinking water. The histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of each tibial bone cavity within each group were observed. The trabecular new bone formation was evaluated by expression rate of osteonectin and osteopontin.", "In the Potentilla fulgens + tibial defect group (14 days), trabecular bone had started combining extensive new bone formation, osteocyte cells were evident, and lamellar bone was formed. Osteoblasts showed a positive reaction with osteonectin. Osteopontin expression was positively observed between fibrous structures and in the osteoblast and osteocyte cells. This can be considered indicative of new bone formation. In the Potentilla fulgens + tibial defect group (28 days), an increase in expansion in trabecular bone and myeloid tissue was observed. Osteoblastic activity and osteocyte cells began to be observed in new bone fragments.", "In our study we show that Potentilla fulgens extract provided a protective effect on new bone formation and aided in the development of osteocytes and secretion of matrix in osteoblasts. Additionally, we show the inductive effect of the extract on new bone formation. In particular, the expression of osteopontin and osteonectin was also supported with the Western blot technique on the development of osteoblasts and osteocytes, showing a similar trend with our results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koparal", "ForeName": "Mahmut", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "\u00cfrteg\u00fcn", "ForeName": "Sevgi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alan", "ForeName": "Hilal", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deveci", "ForeName": "Engin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "G\u00fcls\u00fcn", "ForeName": "Belgin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seker", "ForeName": "Ugur", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Quant Cytopathol Histpathol", "NlmUniqueID": "101638882", "ISSNLinking": "2578-742X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteonectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spp1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106441-73-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteopontin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fracture Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Osteonectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Osteopontin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Potentilla"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tibia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tibial Fractures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27386632"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
