Its member tribe Haemantheae occurs chiefly in South Africa, where around twenty of its species are identifiable with a wide variety of functions in such practices.", "This account details work published from 2013 to 2020 on the tribe Haemantheae involving Clivia, Cryptostephanus, Haemanthus, Scadoxus and Gethyllis. Focus is maintained on the traditional medicinal aspects, pharmacological activities and identification of the active principles. Significant effort is also made to outline the molecular basis to some of these effects.", "The major search engine platforms including, SciFinder, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Google Scholar were utilized at the literature consolidation stage. Keywords engaged in the process included 'Amaryllidaceae' and 'Haemantheae' as well as individual genera and specie names.", "Twenty-four species of the five genera were encountered over the designated time frame. New traditional medicinal information has emerged on nine of these species, where usage ranged from the treatment of wounds and infections, circulatory and gastrointestinal issues to AIDS and TB. Significant amounts of new data also appeared in relation to the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticholinesterase, antidepressive and cytotoxic effects of these plants. Potent activities were observed in some instances, as they were in regards to the anti-inflammatory effects of some Gethyllis species in their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory effects. The entities behind these activities, with few exceptions, were shown to be isoquinoline alkaloids which are known to dominate the chemistry of the Amaryllidaceae. Interesting observations were also made for the mechanisms behind some of the effects, notably in the inflammatory and motorneuron disease arenas.", "The tribe Haemantheae has proved to be a rich and diverse platform for studies of the Amaryllidaceae in the key areas of traditional medicine, pharmacology and phytochemistry. Indigenous knowledge has played a significant role in guiding the biological evaluations, while identification of the active principles has been bolstered by the exceedingly rich alkaloid diversity of the Amaryllidaceae. As such, Haemantheae should continue to feature prominently in drug discovery efforts targeted at the family."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
