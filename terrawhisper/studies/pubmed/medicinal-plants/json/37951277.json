The leaf methanolic extracts of seven Acacia species growing in Egypt namely: Acacia saligna, Acacia seyal, Acacia xanthophloea, Acacia tortilis subsp. raddiana., Acacia tortilis, Acacia laeta, Acacia albida were analyzed using UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS. A total of 37 polyphenols were identified and discussed in detail. They included phenolic acids, flavonoids, and procyanidins, among which sixteen polyphenols were identified in Acacia for the first time. Folin-ciocalteau assay and ferric reducing antioxidant power, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity, 2,20 -azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cation radical and the scavenging capacity against 2,2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl radical were performed to investigate the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity of the Acacia extracts, respectively. Furthermore, the absolute quantification of eighteen polyphenols common to most of the species was performed using UPLC-MS. It was evident that the differences in the chemical composition among the species accounted for the difference in antioxidant activity which was in line together with the total phenolic content."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
