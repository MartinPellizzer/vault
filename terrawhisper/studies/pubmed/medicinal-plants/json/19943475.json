MS +6-BA 1.5-2.0 mg x L(-1) + NAA 0.1-0.3 mg x L(-1) was suitable for the induction and proliferation of indefinite buds. The buds were transferred to 1/2 MS medium supplemented with NAA 0.1-0.3 mg x L(-1) for rooting. The shoots produced roots of culture and formed complete plantlets. The regenerated plantlets originated from somatic cells. At the same time, the effects of pretreatment of low temperature at 4 degrees C on the callus induction were studied and discussed.", "This paper sets up the method of tissue culture of anther somatic-cells and intermediate propagation of L. spicata var. prolifera."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Key Laboratory of Natural Medicinal Chemistry and Resource Evaluation, Tongji School of Pharmacy, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. zqtcm@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qun", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jianqiu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaogang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jingwen", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jiachun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liriope Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19943475"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
