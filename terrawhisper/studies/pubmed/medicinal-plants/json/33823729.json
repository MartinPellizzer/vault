Beauv. (Icacinaceae) is a good source of natural antioxidants, having the potential to protect against oxidative stress-related diseases and complications. This study investigated the antioxidant, hepatoprotective and curative effects of flavonoid-rich fraction of <i>L. africana</i> leaves (LAFRF) against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity in Wistar rats. Phytochemical, nutrient content, and <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> antioxidant activity of LAFRF were determined by standard methods. Fifty Wistar rats were randomized into 10 groups (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20095). Groups 1 and 2 served as normal and CCl<sub>4</sub> controls, respectively. Groups 3A-6A constituted the protective study while groups 3B-6B represented the curative study. The effects of LAFRF at 3, 10, and 30\u2009mg/kg body weight (b.w.) on lipid peroxidation, antioxidant status, liver enzymes activities, and histology of CCl<sub>4</sub>-intoxicated rats were assessed. LAFRF total flavonoids (281.05\u2009\u00b1\u20097.44\u2009mg QE/g), indicated LD<sub>50</sub> above 5000\u2009mg/kg b.w., and scavenged ABTS*<sup>+</sup> with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u2009\u00b5g/mL relative to butylated hydroxytoluene (4.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.00\u2009\u00b5g/mL), and a concentration-dependent increase in total antioxidant capacity. Carbon tetrachloride (1\u2009mL/kg) triggered significant (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) increases in malonedialdehyde concentration (2.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21\u2009mg/mL), with a corresponding decline in antioxidant status, and increases in alkaline phosphatase, alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities (68.00\u2009\u00b1\u20099.59\u2009IU/L, 79.60\u2009\u00b1\u20095.03\u2009IU/L and 81.80\u2009\u00b1\u20093.96\u2009IU/L), respectively. LAFRF significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) lowered lipid peroxidation levels, liver enzyme activities, increased antioxidant status, and improved hepatic histo-architecture of pre- and post LAFRF-treated rats. This demonstrates its high antioxidative, hepatoprotective and curative effects, indicating its potential for future drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9201-8811"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Federal Republic of Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ekpo", "ForeName": "Daniel Emmanuel", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1837-0312"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Federal Republic of Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Joshua", "ForeName": "Parker Elijah", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Federal Republic of Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Centre for Non-Food Biorefinery, Guangxi Academy of Sciences, Nanning, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Odiba", "ForeName": "Arome Solomon", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Federal Republic of Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, University of Mkar, Mkar Gboko, Federal Republic of Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nwodo", "ForeName": "Okwesilieze Fred Chiletugo", "Initials": "OFC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33823729", "10.1080/01480545.2021.1892957"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
