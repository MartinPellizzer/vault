As most of the drugs directed to a variety of targets have failed in finding a medical solution, natural products from Ayurvedic medicine or nutraceutical compounds emerge as a viable preventive therapeutics' pathway. Considering that AD is a multifactorial disease, nutraceutical compounds offer the advantage of a multitarget approach, tagging different molecular sites in the human brain, as compared with the single-target activity of most of the drugs used for AD treatment. We review in-depth important medicinal plants that have been already investigated for therapeutic uses against AD, focusing on a diversity of pharmacological actions. These targets include inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, \u03b2-amyloid senile plaques, oxidation products, inflammatory pathways, specific brain receptors, etc., and pharmacological actions so diverse as anti-inflammatory, memory enhancement, nootropic effects, glutamate excitotoxicity, anti-depressants, and antioxidants. In addition, we also discuss the activity of nutraceutical compounds and phytopharmaceuticals formulae, mainly directed to tau protein aggregates mechanisms of action. These include compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, morin, delphinidins, quercetin, luteolin, oleocanthal, and meganatural-az and other phytochemicals such as huperzine A, limonoids, azaphilones, and aged garlic extract. Finally, we revise the nutraceutical formulae BrainUp-10 composed of Andean shilajit and B-complex vitamins, with memory enhancement activity and the control of neuropsychiatric distress in AD patients. This integrated view on nutraceutical opens a new pathway for future investigations and clinical trials that are likely to render some results based on medical evidence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurosciences and Functional Medicine, International Center for Biomedicine (ICC) and Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}], "LastName": "Calfio", "ForeName": "Camila", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurosciences and Functional Medicine, International Center for Biomedicine (ICC) and Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Scientific Education and Technology Foundation, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Sandeep Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Santiago, Santiago, Chile."}], "LastName": "Rojo", "ForeName": "Leonel E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Neurosciences and Functional Medicine, International Center for Biomedicine (ICC) and Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile."}], "LastName": "Maccioni", "ForeName": "Ricardo B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Alzheimers Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9814863", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2877"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurofibrillary Tangles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32651325", "10.3233/JAD-200443", "JAD200443"]}}]}
