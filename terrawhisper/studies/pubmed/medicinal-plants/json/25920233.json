To test posited roles for these two lysine residues in inhibitor action we assayed the potency of L-CA and several STI against a panel of K156 and K159 mutants. Mutagenesis of K156 conferred resistance to L-CA and mutagenesis of either K156 or K159 conferred resistance to STI indicating that the cationic charge at these two viral DNA-binding residues is important for inhibitor potency. IN K156N, a reported polymorphism associated with resistance to RGV, conferred resistance to L-CA and STI as well. To investigate the apparent preference L-CA exhibits for interactions with K156, we assayed the potency of several hybrid inhibitors containing combinations of DCTA and STI pharmacophores against recombinant IN K156A or K159A. Although K156A conferred resistance to diketo acid-branched bis-catechol hybrid inhibitors, neither K156A nor K159A conferred resistance to their monocatechol counterparts, suggesting that bis-catechol moieties direct DCTAs toward K156. In contrast, STI were more promiscuous in their interaction with K156 and K159. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that DCTAs interact with IN in a manner different than that of STI and suggest that DCTAs are an attractive candidate chemotype for development into drugs potent against STI-resistant IN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Crosby", "ForeName": "David C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Xiangyang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gibbs", "ForeName": "Charles G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reinecke", "ForeName": "Manfred G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robinson", "ForeName": "W Edward", "Initials": "WE", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "5R01AI063973", "Acronym": "AI", "Agency": "NIAID NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Integrase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "HIV Integrase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S4YY3V8YHD", "NameOfSubstance": "chicoric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Integrase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Integrase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Succinates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25920233"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
