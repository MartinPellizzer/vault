In the well-controlled study, Choto-san was superior in global improvement rating, utility rating and improvement of subjective symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and disturbance in daily living activities. In the double-blind study, with more objective criteria than the well-controlled study, Choto-san was also superior in global improvement rating, utility rating and improvement of subjective symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and disturbance in daily living activities. These results suggest that Choto-san is effective in the treatment of vascular dementia. Uncaria sinensis (OLIV.) HAVIL. (US) is the main medicinal plant composing Choto-san. Glutamate-induced cell death of cultured cerebellar granule cells was protected by the application of water extract of US in a dose-dependent manner, and concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-4) g/ml had a significant effect compared to exposure to glutamate only. Further, the increase of 45Ca2+ influx into cells by glutamate was also blocked by the water extract in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that US has a protective effect on glutamate-induced neuronal death in cultured cerebellar granule cells through the inhibition of Ca2+ influx."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Kampo Diagnostics, Research Institute of Natural Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Japan. trad@ms.toyama-mpu.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itoh", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terasawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Mech Ageing Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "0347227", "ISSNLinking": "0047-6374"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "choto-san"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activities of Daily Living"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebellum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dementia, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10656534", "10.1016/s0047-6374(99)00062-7", "S0047-6374(99)00062-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
