Thirty-five men and women were randomized to receive capsules containing celandin-aloevera-psyllium, or placebo, in a double-blind trial lasting 28 days. Symptoms in the last 2 weeks of the treatment period were compared to those in the 14-day pre-trial basal period. In the celandin, aloevera and psyllium group, bowel movements became more frequent, the stools were softer and laxative dependence was reduced. In the placebo group, all these parameters were unchanged. Abdominal pain was not reduced in either group. The results of this study show that the preparation is an effective laxative in the treatment of constipation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Intestinal Diseases Unit, Soroka Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel."}], "LastName": "Odes", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Madar", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Digestion", "NlmUniqueID": "0150472", "ISSNLinking": "0012-2823"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kal Keva"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "celandin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Constipation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1800188", "10.1159/000200705"]}}]}
