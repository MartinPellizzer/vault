Considering flavonoids and phenolics in medicinal plants generally have strong antioxidant activity, we firstly detected the total flavonoids and phenolics contents of KFEE and its fractions. Secondly, we evaluated the antioxidant activities of KFEE and its fractions. Finally, we evaluated the oral safety of KFEE by the acute and 28-day subacute toxicities. The n-butanol fraction (ENBF) possessed the highest phenolics and flavonoids with values of 77.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.17\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalents/g and 228.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.56\u00a0mg rutin equivalents/g, respectively. The results of antioxidant tests showed that ENBF possessed potent antioxidant ability. Among them, the high antioxidation capacity observed in ENBF could be attributed to its rich content of flavonoids and phenolics. The results of toxicological studies showed that the LD<sub>50</sub> value of KFEE was 6000\u00a0mg/kg BW, and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of KFEE was 600\u00a0mg/kg BW. According to the standards of the American Academy of Sciences for the classification of toxic substances, KFEE can be classified as practically non-toxic substance, which provided valuable evidence for the oral safety of KF as a natural aging delay medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
