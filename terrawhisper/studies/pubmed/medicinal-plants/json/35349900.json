Rice has a high probability for adulteration by food fraudsters, being a staple commodity for more than half the global population, making the assessment of geographical origins of rice for authenticity important in terms of protecting businesses and consumers. In this study, we describe ICP-MS elemental profiling coupled with elementomic modelling to identify the geographical indications of Indian, Chinese, and Vietnamese rice. A PLS-DA model exhibited good discrimination (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.8393, Q<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.7673, accuracy\u00a0=\u00a01.0). Data-driven soft independent modelling of class analogy (dd-SIMCA) and K-nearest neighbours (K-NN) models have good sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
