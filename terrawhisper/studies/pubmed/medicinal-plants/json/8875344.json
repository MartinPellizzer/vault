Treatment of these diseases has been difficult, though numerous agents have been tried. Natural products could be a good field to venture into because various medicinal plants have been used for centuries to treat circulation stasis, inflammation, visual disturbances, and eyesight failure. Tetramethyl-pyrazine, coumarin, methyl tyramine, rescinnamine, apocynin, and hesperetin are some natural products isolated from Chinese herbs for improving ocular blood flow, particularly in the choroid and retina. For ocular inflammation, at least a dozen natural products are reviewed in this article. Among those, matrine, tetrandrine and osthole draw particular attention, because they are effective mainly as interleukin-1 blockers, but not as arachidonate blockers. As a result, these agents are potent anti-inflammatory agents and are even more potent than the prototype corticosteroid, prednisolone. It is hoped that all aforementioned agents can be used to treat retinopathies resulting from ocular ischemia and/or ocular inflammation. Scoparone, corylifolinin, epigallocatechin-3-0-gallate, esculetin, and lespedezaflavanone A are some natural products which can improve retinal functions measured with electroretinogram's b-wave recovery. Further research should be carried out to relate natural products which can improve ocular blood flow and inflammation to retinal function and vice versa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Ocular Pharmacology, Texas A&M University College of Medicine, College Station, USA."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S X", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Ocul Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9511091", "ISSNLinking": "1080-7683"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Flow Velocity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electroretinography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophthalmitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Retina"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Retinal Vessels"}], "NumberOfReferences": "52"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8875344", "10.1089/jop.1996.12.377"]}}]}
