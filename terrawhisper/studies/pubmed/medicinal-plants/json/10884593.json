The viral load and innate immunity mediated by NK cells and M&phi; during early stage of the infection were analyzed. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BSO to BALB/c mice, a susceptible strain of MCMV infection, strikingly inhibited the virus titers in spleen and liver on day 3 of infection with 1x10(5) PFU MCMV. This effect coincided with an increase in serum level of IFN-gamma. Although BSO treatment decreased both number and cytolytic function of NK cells on day 3 of infection, it increased numbers of M&phi; and CD4(+) T cells. On day 10 of infection, the virus titer was undetectable in spleen and liver of BSO-treated mice, while it was detectable in control mice. Although spleen of both control and BSO-treated mice showed similar CTL activities on day 10 after infection, serum level of IFN-gamma in BSO-treated mice was higher. Furthermore, BSO treatment upregulated suppressor function of M&phi; in spleen. These results show that BSO exhibited a striking antiviral effect against MCMV infection which may be mediated by increasing of M&phi; number and function, and IFN-gamma production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. mohamed_84@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Salem", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hossain", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7904799", "ISSNLinking": "0192-0561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology", "prevention & control", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytomegalovirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Load"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10884593", "10.1016/s0192-0561(00)00036-9", "S0192-0561(00)00036-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
