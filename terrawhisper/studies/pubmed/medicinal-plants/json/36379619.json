The concentration of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) in the exhaled breath (EB) of COVID-19 patients suffering from AKI symptoms will be significantly increased. In this work, the detection of breath NH<sub>3</sub> was performed at gold interdigital electrodes modified with a soluble polypyrrole microparticle and silver nanoparticle film (Au-IDEs/S-PPyMPs/AgNPs) as a noninvasive chemiresistor gas sensor. The response behavior of unmodified and modified gas sensors toward NH<sub>3</sub> and other interfering compounds was studied. The Au-IDEs/S-PPyMPs/AgNPs exhibited NH<sub>3</sub> detection in the linear dynamic range of 1.00-19.23 ppm, with a limit of detection of 0.12 ppm. Finally, the fabricated gas sensor was used to monitor the NH<sub>3</sub> concentration in the EB of COVID-19 patients suffering from AKI symptoms. For this purpose, the gas sensor was validated in 19 EB samples (seven COVID-19-positive patients, four COVID-19-negative patients, and eight post-COVID-19 patients). The gas sensor was directly exposed to the EB samples, followed by recording the changes in electrical resistance via a low-cost digital multimeter. The sensing mechanism was explained as the interaction between breath NH<sub>3</sub> and sensing materials. The breath NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations have a desirable correlation (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.8463) with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values in COVID-19-positive patients. The fabricated gas sensor can distinguish COVID-19-positive patients suffering from AKI symptoms from COVID-19-negative patients and post-COVID-19 patients. The present work can pave the way for the development of a simple and efficient analytical approach for COVID-19 patients with AKI without the need for sample pretreatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamalabadi", "ForeName": "Mahdie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4017-3606"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghoorchian", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}], "LastName": "Derakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Katayoun", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urology & Nephrology Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholyaf", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan 6517838736, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ravan", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7664-41-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonia"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30604-81-0", "NameOfSubstance": "polypyrrole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrroles"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breath Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyrroles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36379619", "10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02760"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
