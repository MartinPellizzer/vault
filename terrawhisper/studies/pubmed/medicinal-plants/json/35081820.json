In the present overview, we aimed to collect studies with the highest level of evidence to shed light on detecting the most effective dietary supplements and medicinal herbs for controlling glycemic status. For the current overview, four electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, were systematically searched from inception to 31 December 2020 and then updated until 1 October 2021 to obtain eligible meta-analyses on either dietary supplements or medicinal herbs and their effects on glycemic status. Fasting blood sugar (FBS) and Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) were considered as primary outcomes. Finally, ninety-one meta-analyses on dietary supplements (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200955) and herbs (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200936) were included. Evidence showed positive effects of chromium, zinc, propolis, aloe vera, milk thistle, fenugreek, cinnamon, ginger, and nettle on FBS and/or HbA1C. However, mostly the heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>) was high. Other supplements and herbs also showed no reduction in glucose levels or their effects were small. Although some dietary supplements and medicinal herbs showed a significant reduction in FBS and/or HbA1C, mostly their effects from the clinical point of view were not remarkable. In addition, due to high heterogeneity, publication bias, and a limited number of included studies in most cases further clinical trials are needed for making decision on anti-diabetic supplement efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9635-0010"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hekmat-Ardakani", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8528-1336"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Midwifery Department, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Morshed-Behbahani", "ForeName": "Bahar", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3555-9416"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Population Health, UNSW, Sydney, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Health Informatics, Australian Institute of Health Innovation, Sydney, Australia."}], "LastName": "Rahimi-Ardabili", "ForeName": "Hania", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1290-1135"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ayati", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3119-2805"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diabetes Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Namazi", "ForeName": "Nazli", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35081820", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2028716"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
