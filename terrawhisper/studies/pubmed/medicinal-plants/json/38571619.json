Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading global health challenge, demanding vigilant prevention and innovative treatments. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of plant mediated SeNPs on sesame metabolic profile and to screen and check the effect bioactive compounds against CVD via molecular drug docking technique. Three sesame germplasms TS-5, TH-6 and Till-18 were treated with varying concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50\u00a0ppm) of plant-mediated selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). There were three groups of treatments group-1 got only seed pretreatments of SeNPs, Group-2 with only foliar applications of SeNPs and Group-3 with both seed pretreatments and foliar applications of SeNPs. It was found that plants treated with 40\u00a0ppm of SeNPS in group 3 exhibited the highest total phenolic and flavonoid content. Total phenolic content at T4 was highest for TS-5 (134%), TH-6 (132%), and Till-18 (112%). LCMS analysis revealed a total of 276 metabolites, with phenolics, flavonoids, and free fatty acids being most abundant. KEGG analysis indicated enrichment in free fatty acid and phenylalanine tryptophan pathways. ADMET analysis and virtual screening resulted in total of five metabolic compounds as a potential ligand against Hemoglobin beta subunit. Lowest binding energy was achieved by Delta-Tocopherol (-6.98) followed by Lactoflavin (-6.20) and Sesamin (-5.00). Lipinski rule of five revealed that all the compounds completely safe to be used as drug against CVD and specifically for HBB. It was concluded that bioactive compounds from sesame could be an alternative source of drug for CVD related problems and especially for HBB."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors.
