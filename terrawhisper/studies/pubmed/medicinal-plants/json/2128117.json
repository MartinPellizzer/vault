The three groups were controls (Group 1), garlic oil applied 30 minutes before DMBA (Group 2), and garlic oil applied 30 minutes after DMBA (Group 3). The percents of mice with papillomas at 20 weeks were 94, 72, and 79, respectively. The decreases in Groups 2 and 3 were significant. The number of papillomas per mouse was 4.2 +/- 0.5 (Group 1), 2.3 +/- 0.8 (Group 2), and 3.4 +/- 0.6 (Group 3). The decrease in Group 2 was significant. A single 5-mg dose of garlic oil maximally inhibited DMBA-induced epidermal DNA synthesis by 86% when applied two hours before the carcinogen. Two-stage promotion in DMBA-initiated Sencar mice was achieved by twice-weekly applications of 8.5 nmol of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 2 weeks followed by twice-weekly applications of 8.5 nmol of mezerein for 18 weeks. The oils were applied 30 minutes after each promotion by TPA or mezerein. Single doses of 1 mg onion or garlic oil inhibited the first and second stages of promotion. The groups used were control (Group 1), garlic oil applied after stage 1 (Group 2), onion oil applied after stage 1 (Group 3), propenyl sulfide applied after stage 1 (Group 4), garlic oil applied after stage 2 (Group 5), onion oil applied after stage 2 (Group 6), and propenyl sulfide applied after stage 2 (Group 7). The percent of mice with papillomas was significantly decreased by all agents in Groups 2-7. The data are 81, 83, 91, 68, 96, and 86, respectively. The number of papillomas per mouse was significantly reduced by onion and garlic oils but not by propenyl sulfide. The data are 9.4 +/- 0.8, 6.3 +/- 0.7, 7.4 +/- 0.5, 9.2 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.9, 6.2 +/- 0.6, and 9.1 +/- 1.4 for Groups 1-7, respectively. Onion and garlic oils inhibited the TPA-stimulated DNA synthesis when given as single doses of 5 mg one hour before TPA. The inhibition by garlic oil was most effective when given one hour before TPA but was evident when given from two hours before to two hours after TPA. These results, and those of others (AS Sadhana, Cancer Lett, 40, 193-197, 1988), who obtained inhibition of initiation, indicate that onion and garlic oils inhibit all stages of mouse skin tumorigenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506."}], "LastName": "Perchellet", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perchellet", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Belman", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "18536", "Agency": "PHS HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA 13343", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES 00260", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VC2W18DGKR", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Papilloma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2128117", "10.1080/01635589009514093"]}}]}
