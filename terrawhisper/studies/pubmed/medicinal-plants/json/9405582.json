The purpose of this study was to use rats as an animal model to obtain experimental data on the inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by dry beans. Fifty-three 5-wk-old weanling male F344 rats were randomly assigned by weight to the following groups: control (11 rats), casein diet (21 rats), and bean diet (21 rats). Animals fed the casein and bean diets were treated with the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) once weekly for 2 wk. Rats in the control group also consumed the casein diet but were not exposed to AOM. All diets were isocaloric. The protein concentration of the diets was adjusted to 18 g/100 g with casein, and the fat concentration was adjusted to 5 g/100 g with corn oil. Rats fed the bean diet had significantly fewer colon adenocarcinomas (P < 0.05) than rats fed the casein diet (5 vs. 22 tumors), and significantly fewer rats fed the bean diet (P < 0.05) had colonic tumors than did casein-fed rats (24 vs. 50%). Tumor multiplicity was also significantly lower for the bean-fed rats, and significantly fewer (P < 0.05) tumors per tumor-bearing rat were observed in bean-fed rats than in casein-fed rats (1.0 +/- 0.0 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.6). This study demonstrates that dry beans contain anticarcinogenic compounds capable of inhibiting AOM-induced colon cancer in rats. However, the specific anticarcinogenic components within dry beans have not been identified, and it is unclear whether dietary fiber, phytochemicals or other components within dry beans are primarily responsible for the anticarcinogenic properties of beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Nutrition Science Program, Health, Physical Education, Exercise Science and Nutrition, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5095, USA."}], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ganthavorn", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilson-Sanders", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MO0N1J0SEN", "NameOfSubstance": "Azoxymethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Adenoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Azoxymethane"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9405582", "10.1093/jn/127.12.2328"]}}]}
