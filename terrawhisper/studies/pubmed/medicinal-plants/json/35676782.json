However, the research and clinical application of MSCs are greatly hindered by the limited cells proliferation and replicative senescence. Therapeutic agents that can both enhance the proliferative ability and decrease the replicative senescence of MSCs are greatly needed, however, not been reported yet. Herein, for the first time, we identified 11 natural compounds from medicinal plants with both excellent proliferative and anti-senescence abilities in MSCs. The qPCR analysis indicated underlying mechanisms associated with fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and leukemia-induced factor in proliferation; the reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial dysfunction autophagy and proteostasis are involved in cells senescence-related mechanism. Phytochemicals are demonstrated as novel therapeutic candidates with promising effects in both stimulating proliferation and retarding replicative senescence of stem cells with high safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
