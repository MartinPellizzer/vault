Considering the inhibitory effects of mitochondrial ATP-dependent potassium channels (mt-K<sub>ATP</sub>) on these pores and anti-ischemic effects of morin, we hypothesized that it may exert its positive effects via activating mt-K<sub>ATP</sub> as well as its anti-oxidative effects.", "Isolated rat hearts were perfused by Krebs-Henseleit solution enriched with the morin (0.25, 0.5 and 1\u00a0mg/L) or 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD, a mt-K<sub>ATP</sub> blocker;100\u00a0\u03bcM) or both as needed 5\u00a0min before starting regional ischemia till the first 10\u00a0min of the reperfusion period. The reperfusion was developed with Krebs-Henseleit solution 60 or 120\u00a0min respectively for biochemical evaluations (lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde level) or the assessment of myocardial infarct size. During the experiments, hemodynamic functions were recorded and cardiac arrhythmias were determined.", "Our findings demonstrated that morin reduced the infarct size. Also, morin perfusion could remarkably prevent the malondialdehyde over-production during ischemia. Total ventricular ectopic beats had the same significant changes as the malondialdehyde level, in both ischemia and reperfusion phases. Morin could also relatively improve the ischemia-induced hemodynamic dysfunction. All mentioned protective effects of morin were reversed by concomitant perfusion of 5-HD.", "Morin has protective effects against ischemic hearts through anti-oxidative effects. It also suggests a link between the cardioprotective effects of morin and mt-K<sub>ATP</sub>. However, additional studies are required to prove this preliminary hypothesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
