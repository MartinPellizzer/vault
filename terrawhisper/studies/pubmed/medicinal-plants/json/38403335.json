Ten species of plants in this genus are distributed in China, some of which are folk medicinal plants with activating blood circulation, relieving pain, dispelling wind, and dehumidifying effects. Their main constituents are lignans and triterpenes. The current pharmacology and clinical studies have shown that their extracts and constituents have anti-rheumatoid arthritis, liver protection, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, and other biological activities. The rheumatologic and liver diseases can also be treated with the plants in the clinic. The new chemical constituents reported in the last decade(2012 to date) from the plants of Kadsura genus in China, as well as their pharmacological effects and clinical applications in recent years were reviewed, so as to provide a theoretical basis for further research on the genus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China Department of Periodical Press, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xin-Yue", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wu-Xian", "Initials": "WX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiang-Ru", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine Changsha 410208, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kadsura"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38403335", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230718.201"]}}]}
