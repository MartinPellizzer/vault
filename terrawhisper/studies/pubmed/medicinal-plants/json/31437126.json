This study aimed to purify and characterize cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory compounds from Ardisia sieboldii leaves. Bioassay-guided chromatographic analyses yielded three compounds, 2-methyl-5-(8Z-heptadecenyl) resorcinol (1), 5-(8Z-heptadecenyl) resorcinol (2), and ardisiaquinone A (3), whereas liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry chemical profiling revealed the presence of diverse resorcinol and alkylbenzoquinone derivatives in cytotoxic 70% methanol extracts. Chemical structures of 1-3 were confirmed by spectroscopic methods including 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), 13C NMR, and electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry. Compounds 1 and 2 were purified from A. sieboldii for the first time, and all three compounds showed cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cell lines and brine shrimps in a dose-response manner. Among them, compound 2 exhibited the highest cytotoxicity on cancer cells (IC50 values of 8.8-25.7 \u03bcM) as well as on brine shrimps (IC50 value of 5.1 \u03bcM). Compounds 1-3 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects through inhibiting protein denaturation (IC50 values of 5.8-9.6 \u03bcM), cyclooxygenase-2 activity (IC50 values of 34.5-60.1 \u03bcM), and nitrite formation in RAW 264.7 cells. Cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activities of 1-3 demonstrated in this study deserve further investigation for considering their suitability as candidates or leads to develop anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PAK Research Center, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Shahinozzaman", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of the Ryukyus, Senbaru 1, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Takahiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Computer Aided Drug Design, The Red-Green Research Centre, Dhaka 1219, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Sciences, University of Arkansas-Fort Smith, Fort Smith, AR 72913, USA."}], "LastName": "Halim", "ForeName": "Mohammad A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Subtropical Field Science Center, Faculty of Agriculture, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hossain", "ForeName": "Md Amzad", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md Tofazzal", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PAK Research Center, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, University of the Ryukyus, Senbaru 1, Nishihara-cho, Okinawa 903-0213, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tawata", "ForeName": "Shinkichi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resorcinols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YUL4LO94HK", "NameOfSubstance": "resorcinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ardisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Denaturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Resorcinols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31437126", "10.1515/znc-2019-0114", "/j/znc.ahead-of-print/znc-2019-0114/znc-2019-0114.xml"]}}]}
