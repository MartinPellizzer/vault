Quantitation of individual saponins is difficult due to lack of available standards, mainly as a consequence of purification difficulties. Determination of total saponin content can be problematic, often relying on non-specific methods based on butanol solubility, haemolytic activity or formation of coloured derivatives.", "To develop a general quantitative method based on the use of the readily available cardenolides, digitoxin (1) and digoxin (2), as internal standards in an HPLC-PAD-based analysis.", "The cardenolides were run at a variety of concentrations to establish linearity and reproducibility of detector response and then evaluated as internal standards for quantitation of triterpene saponins in several plant-derived extracts by HPLC-PAD. Mixtures of saponins, largely freed from other extractables, were obtained by fractionation of total extracts on solid phase extraction columns (SPE) employing a water-methanol gradient and used for construction of calibration curves. Saponin identification and structural information was obtained via a single quadrupole mass detector using electrospray ionisation in negative ion mode (ESI(-)).", "Saponin contents in six samples from five species were determined and compared with literature results and a gravimetric method based on butanol-water partitioning. Results were generally consistent with literature reports and superior to gravimetric butanol-water partitioning.", "Digitoxin and digoxin are useful as internal standards in HPLC estimation of saponin content. Saponins from different species having similar structures and molecular weights afford similar calibration curves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Biotechnology Institute, National Research Council of Canada, 110 Gymnasium Place, Saskatoon, SK, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balsevich", "ForeName": "J John", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bishop", "ForeName": "Greg G", "Initials": "GG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deibert", "ForeName": "Leah K", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E90NZP2L9U", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calendula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Digitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vaccaria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18819105", "10.1002/pca.1095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
