Pilot studies indicated that single dose administration of IHp had very little or no acute behavioural effects, hence the IHp was administered orally at two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) once daily for three consecutive days, while imipramine (15 mg/kg, i.p.), a clinically used antidepressant agent, was administered acutely to rats (CF strain, 150 +/- 10 g) and mice (Wistar strain, 23 +/- 2 g) of either sex as the standard drug. Controls animals were treated similarly with equal volume of vehicle (0.3% carboxymethyl cellulose). Indian Hypericum perforatum extract showed significant antidepressant activity on all the paradigms of depression used. Thus IHp and imipramine treatments significantly reduced the immobility time in BD and TS tests. Significant reduction in escape failures was also observed in LH test. In RIH test IHp and imipramine inhibited reserpine induced hypothermia in a dose dependent manner. The observed antidepressant activity of IHp was qualitatively comparable to that induced by imipramine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaiswal", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OGG85SX4E4", "NameOfSubstance": "Imipramine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imipramine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10865882"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
