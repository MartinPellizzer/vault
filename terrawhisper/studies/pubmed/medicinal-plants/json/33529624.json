The active components were screened from T. sinensis by ligand fishing using the magnetic immobilized \u03b1-amylase prepared through solvothermal and crosslinking methods. HSCCC was used to separate the target compound according to the K value. As a result, a potential active compound 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-\u03b2-d-glucose and a non-target compound quercetin-3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranoside were separated and identified. In-vitro experiments indicated that 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-\u03b2-d-glucose had the activity against \u03b1-amylase and the IC<sub>50</sub> value was 93.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.80\u00a0\u03bcg/mL which was higher than that of the non-target compound. The result further confirmed the molecular fishing effect of magnetic immobilized \u03b1-amylase. The present study can not only find and separate the hypoglycemic substances in T. sinensis quickly and effectively, but also can provide a new approach for the study of natural active components."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
