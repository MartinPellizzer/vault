Api and TA strongly inhibited the bacterial mutagenesis induced by nitropyrenes, while I3C and EA had little or no effect. For example, in TA98, 0.2 mumole Api resulted in 48% and 56% inhibition of the mutagenicity induced by 4 nmole 1-NP and 0.035 nmole 1,6-DNP, respectively. With an equal dose, TA caused 46% and 50% reduction of the mutagenicity induced by 1-NP and 1,6-DNP, respectively. As expected, a good correlation was observed between the antimutagenicity of nitropyrenes and their inhibitory effect on nitroreductase activity. This indicated that one of the possible antimutagenic mechanisms of Api or TA was to inactivate the metabolism of nitropyrenes. Two biological end-points, cytotoxicity and sister-chromatid exchange (SCEs), were used to screen the antigenotoxic effects of these compounds in CHO cells. At the sub-cytotoxic dose, I3C, Api and TA all protected against the cytotoxicity induced by 1-NP and 1,6-DNP, but only TA and Api gave a significant reduction of the frequency of SCEs. Moreover, this reduction was found to be highly dose-dependent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Toxicology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66Q2ZUF83N", "NameOfSubstance": "1,6-dinitropyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C11E72455F", "NameOfSubstance": "indole-3-carbinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TD1665I8Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "1-nitropyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "CHO Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sister Chromatid Exchange"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1383740", "10.1016/0027-5107(92)90119-m", "0027-5107(92)90119-M"]}}]}
