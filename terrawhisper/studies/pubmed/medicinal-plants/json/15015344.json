Targeting dosage form is the fourth-generation drug dosage form and it is ideal system for administration because it release the theraping drugs in the targeting-site. Particular emphasis was placed on liposome due to it was used as a drug carrier. Meanwhile, the highlights of research were on magnetic and enzyme targeting preparations. In addition, oral colon targeting drug delivery system, drugs were carried to ileocecum and release to get local and whole effect, is also an important part of targeting dosage form. The study on traditional chinese medicine (TCM) targeting dosage form is still at beginning stage in China. At present, most of study on TCM and natural products targeting drugs were focus on simple effective component and merely on TCM effective positions in relative with the difficult for determing their quality standard and procedure of preparing. It is the kernel item for TCM modernization and the key for TCM internationalization to develop new dosage form and new technology of TCM. There is a need in collaboration with multiple discipline. It will be a important research subject to develop TCM targeting preparation in the near future. TCM targeting dosage form can be classified into liposome, nanoparticles, multiple emulsion etc according to the difference of carrier and oral, rectal, colonic, nasal, dermal, ocular system on a basis of administration and so on. This paper made a summary on TCM and natural products targeting dosage form according to different targeting positions and introduce the procedure of preparing compared with the effect in vivo and manifest that TCM and natural products targeting dosage form will have good exploit prospect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Zhongshan Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-xin", "Initials": "CX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xue-hua", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}], "NumberOfReferences": "21"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
