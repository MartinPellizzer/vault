In this review, we summarized its traditional uses, chemical constituents, quality control measures, pharmacological activities, therapeutic evaluation, toxicity evaluation and clinical applications. 130 chemical constituents isolated from IS have been reported, including flavones, sesquiterpenes, triterpenes, phenylpropanoids, organic acids and others. They showed various pharmacological activities, such as protecting cardiocerebral vascular system, anticancer effect and antiviral etc. The quality control evaluation studies, clinical applications, other possible applications and suggestions for future research also were discussed. The aim of this review is to critically appraise the available literature and suggest directions for further development of IS to improve its medical value and use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
