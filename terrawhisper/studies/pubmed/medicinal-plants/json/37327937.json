Polysaccharide is the most important bioactive ingredient in B. striata and has various health benefits. Recently, B. striata polysaccharides (BSPs) have attracted much attention from industries and researchers due to their remarkable immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, hemostatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, gastroprotective, and liver protective effects. Despite the successful isolation and characterization of BSPs, there is still limited knowledge regarding their structure-activity relationships (SARs), safety concerns, and applications, which hinders their full utilization and development. Herein, we provided an overview of the extraction, purification, and structural features, as well as the effects of different influencing factors on the components and structures of BSPs. We also highlighted and summarized the diversity of chemistry and structure, specificity of biological activity, and SARs of BSP. The challenges and opportunities of BSPs in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmeceutical fields are discussed, and the potential development and future study direction are scrutinized. This article provides comprehensive knowledge and underpinnings for further research and application of BSPs as therapeutic agents and multifunctional biomaterials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
