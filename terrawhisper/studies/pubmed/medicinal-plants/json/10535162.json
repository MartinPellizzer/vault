Important roles in obtaining and disseminating scientific knowledge in pharmaceutical sciences were played by the Institute for Drug Research in Prague, Central Union of Pharmacists, and a number of pharmacies. In drug research, several new preparations were devised; the greatest achievement was the method of manufacture of \"Czech\" penicillin, which was used already during the war. The inland basis of raw materials was enlarged by cultivation and collection of medicinal plants. Scientific knowledge gained during the war in pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacognosy and galenical pharmacy contributed after the liberation in 1945 to the establishment of pharmaceutical sciences, which had not had a sufficient basis before."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nov\u00e1cek", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Formov\u00e1n\u00ed v\u0115deck\u00fdch z\u00e1klad\u016f cesk\u00e9 farmacie v letech 1939-1945."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Czech Republic", "MedlineTA": "Ceska Slov Farm", "NlmUniqueID": "9433765", "ISSNLinking": "1210-7816"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Czech Republic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10535162"]}}]}
