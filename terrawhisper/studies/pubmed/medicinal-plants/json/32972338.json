The resistance of pathogenic bacteria and deaths attributable to bacterial infections is increasing exponentially. Bacteria used different mechanisms to counterattack to existing antibiotics, namely (i) enzymatic inhibition, (ii) penicillin-binding protein modification, (iii) porin mutations, (iv) efflux pumps and (v) molecular modifications of antibiotic targets. Developing new antibiotics would be time-consuming to address such a situation, thus one of the promising approaches is by potentiating existing antibiotics. Plants used synergism to naturally defend and protect themselves from microbes. Using the same strategy, several studies have shown that the combinations of natural products and antibiotics could effectively prolong the lifespan of existing antibiotics and minimize the impact and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Combining essential oils constituents, namely uvaol, ferruginol, farnesol and carvacrol, with antibiotics, have proved to be efficient efflux pump inhibitors. Plant-derived compounds such as gallic acid and tannic acid are effective potentiators of various antibiotics, including novobiocin, chlorobiocin, coumermycin, fusidic acid, and rifampicin, resulting in a 4-fold increase in the potencies of these antibiotics. Several lines of research, as discussed in this review, have demonstrated the effectiveness of natural products in potentiating existing antibiotics. For this reason, the search for more efficient combinations should be an ongoing process with the aim to extend the life of the ones that we have and may preserve the life for the ones that are yet to come."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Mauritius, 230Reduit, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Sadeer", "ForeName": "Nabeelah Bibi", "Initials": "NB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department for Management of Science and Technology Development, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Applied Sciences, Ton Duc Thang University, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Mohamad Fawzi", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32972338", "10.2174/1389450121666200924113740", "CDT-EPUB-110195"]}}]}
