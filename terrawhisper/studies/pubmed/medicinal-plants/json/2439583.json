To further analyze the connectivity of these fibers, the target neurons must be chemically characterized. In vibratome and frozen sections of rat brain, we tried to visualize PHA-L-labeled fibers and, simultaneously, the target neuron-related antigen. As a model system we used the projection from the pre-frontal cortex to histaminergic neurons in the posterior hypothalamic region. We tested \"sequential\" and \"pooled\" immunocytochemical procedures. In the sequential procedure, the two antigens are detected by two successive and complete immunocytochemical staining procedures, with primary antibodies raised in different animal species and with different chromogens for the final visualization. In the pooled procedure, the sections are incubated with mixtures of primary and secondary antibodies, after which the procedure is similar to the sequential procedure. We obtained excellent results on vibratome sections with a sequential procedure using first conventional peroxidase immunocytochemistry (goat anti-PHA-L primary antibody) to visualize the transported PHA-L (brown reaction product), and subsequently alkaline phosphatase immunocytochemistry (rabbit anti-histidine decarboxylase primary antibody) to locate the histaminergic neurons (blue reaction product). The resulting preparations deteriorate, however, after 1-2 months of storage. Good results were also obtained with a double peroxidase procedure on frozen sections, using nickel-enhanced diaminobenzidine to visualize the PHA-L (dark blue reaction product), and diaminobenzidine (brown reaction product) to visualize the second antigen. The quality of these preparations is permanent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wouterlood", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bol", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Steinbusch", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Histochem Cytochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9815334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "leukoagglutinins, plants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Histidine Decarboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Axonal Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Histidine Decarboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2439583", "10.1177/35.8.2439583"]}}]}
