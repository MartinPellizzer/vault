To examine this second claim, medical marijuana was compared with its primary active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol.", "A search on MEDLINE (1966-1999), AGRICOLA (1990-1999), and Biological and Agricultural Index (1964-1999) using keywords \"cannabinoids,\" \"marijuana,\" \"tetrahydrocannabinol,\" \"Cannabis,\" and \"hemp.\" Phytochemical and ethnobotanical data were searched with the Agricultural Research Service database.

Inhaling tetrahydrocannabinol, which avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism, has advantages over ingesting it. Other cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids can reduce tetrahydrocannabinol-induced anxiety, cholinergic deficits, and immunosuppression. Other compounds increase cerebral blood flow, enhance cortical activity, kill respiratory pathogens, and provide anti-inflammatory activity. The hazards of marijuana smoke can be reduced with appropriate technology. Proprietary Cannabis extracts containing a mixture of cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids are currently being developed and tested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family Practice, University of Vermont College of Medicine in Middlebury, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McPartland", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pruitt", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7J8897W37S", "NameOfSubstance": "Dronabinol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dronabinol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "100"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10394675"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
