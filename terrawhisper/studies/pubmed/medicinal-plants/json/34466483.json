Despite the decline in infectious eye diseases, which has reduced the vision impairment and blindness over the past two decades, vision impairment is still a major health problem in some parts of the world. In traditional medicine books, visual weakness is referred to as \"<i>any disturbance in the act of seeing</i> \". Many medicinal herbs have been mentioned in books of Traditional Iranian medicine (TIM) for the management of vision impairment. The aim of this study is to review the medicinal plants mentioned in TIM, which are considered effective for the treatment of vision impairment or its enhancement. In this library-based study, medicinal plants effective in the treatment of vision impairment were searched using 6 valid sources of traditional medicine, including <i>Makhzan ol-Adawiya</i>, <i>The Canon of Medicine</i>, <i>Tuhfat al-Momenin</i>, <i>Al-Abniyah An Haqaiq al-adwiya</i>, <i>Al-Shamil Fi al-Sana'at al-tebiyah</i>, and <i>Ekhtiarate Badiee</i>. This was done in 10 steps (finding keywords, searching for resources, preparing a single list, finding synonyms, classifying, reviewing, extracting plants from compositions, summarizing, scoring and sorting based on the obtained score). A total of 89 medicinal plants were extracted, most of which had a hot and dry temperament. Based on the obtained score, 12 plants got the highest scores (10 and above). The extracted plants can be the basis for further clinical studies to make new effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of vision impairment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 2019, Galen Medical Journal."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Iranian Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shayanfar", "ForeName": "Jamshid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ophthalmology, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaili", "ForeName": "Seyed Saeed", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alijaniha", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Social Medicine, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Davati", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Galen Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "101625418", "ISSNLinking": "2322-2379"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mohammadi SF, Saeedi-Anari G, Ashrafi E, Mohammadi SM, Farzadfar F. et al.
