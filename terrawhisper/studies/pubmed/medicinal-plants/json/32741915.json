All the synthesized compounds exhibited dual COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activity with obvious selectivity against COX-2. The pyrazolylpyrazolines 4a-d and 8a-f bearing two vicinal aryl moieties in the pyrazoline nucleus showed more selectivity towards COX-2. Within these two series, derivatives 4c, d and 8d-f bearing the benzenesulfonamide group were the most selective. Compounds 4a-d and 8a-f were further subjected to in vivo anti-inflammatory screening, ulcerogenic liability and showed good anti-inflammatory activity with no ulcerogenic effect. In addition compounds 4c and 8d as examples showed prostaglandin (PG)E<sub>2</sub> inhibition % 44.23 and 51.4 respectively, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) inhibition % 33.48 and 41.41 respectively and gastroprotective effect in ethanol induced rodent gastric ulcer model. In addition, to explore the binding mode and selectivity of our compounds, 8d and celecoxib were docked into the active site of COX-1 and COX-2. It was found that compound 8d exhibited a binding pattern and interactions similar to that of celecoxib with COX-2 active site, while bitter manner of interaction than celecoxib to COX-1 active site."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University."}], "LastName": "Ragab", "ForeName": "Fatma Abd El-Fattah", "Initials": "FAE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Desert Research Centre."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Enas Ibrahim", "Initials": "EI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Department, Medical Division, National Research Centre."}], "LastName": "Abdel Jaleel", "ForeName": "Gehad A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Desert Research Centre."}], "LastName": "Selim", "ForeName": "Ahmed Abbass Mohamed Abd El-Rahman", "Initials": "AAMAE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, October University for Modern Sciences and Arts (MSA)."}], "LastName": "Nissan", "ForeName": "Yassin Mohammed", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfonamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PTGS1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JCX84Q7J1L", "NameOfSubstance": "Celecoxib"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Celecoxib"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfonamides"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzenesulfonamides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32741915", "10.1248/cpb.c20-00193"]}}]}
