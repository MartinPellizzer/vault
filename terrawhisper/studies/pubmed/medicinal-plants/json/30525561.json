The binding, therefore, resulted in alterations of VEGF binding to its receptor and revealed the roles of VEGF in angiogenesis. Several lines of evidence gave support to the inhibitory activities of resveratrol in VEGF-triggered angiogenesis. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), compared with a VEGF-induced group, resveratrol, at a high concentration, suppressed VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation, cell migration, cell invasion, and tube formation by 80 \u00b1 9.01%, 140 \u00b1 3.78%, 110 \u00b1 7.51%, and 120 \u00b1 10.26%, respectively. Moreover, resveratrol inhibited the subintestinal vessel formation in zebrafish embryo. In signaling cascades, application of resveratrol in HUVECs reduced the VEGF-triggered VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, the VEGF-mediated phosphorylations of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase B, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were obviously decreased by (3 \u00b1 0.37)-, (2 \u00b1 0.27)- and (6 \u00b1 0.23)-fold, respectively, in the presence of resveratrol at high concentration. Parallelly, the VEGF-induced reactive oxygen species formation was significantly decreased by 50 \u00b1 7.88% to 120 \u00b1 14.82% under resveratrol treatment. Thus, our results provided support to the antiangiogenic roles of resveratrol, as well as its related signaling mechanisms, in attenuating the VEGF-mediated responses. The present results supported possible development of resveratrol, which should be considered as a therapeutic agent in terms of prevention and clinical treatment of diseases related to angiogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Edible and Medicinal Bioresources , HKUST Shenzhen Research
