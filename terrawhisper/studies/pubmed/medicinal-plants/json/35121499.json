Meanwhile, their energy and C stability parameters were also evaluated here. The results showed that biochar produced in air-limitation had less yield, fixed C and bulk C, as well as more volatile matter and inorganic elements than that produced in CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>. Biochars derived from thermo-conversion of pine sawdust in CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at 450-750\u00a0\u00b0C had the greatest energy densification ratios (EDR) (range: 1.40-1.61), because pine sawdust contained more lignin than wheat straw, and the thermo-conversion of lignin in N<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> at 450-750\u00a0\u00b0C benefited for the formation of fixed C. Recalcitrance potential (R<sub>50</sub>) results showed that the biochars produced in CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at 600-750\u00a0\u00b0C had the highest carbon stability (R<sub>50</sub>: 0.54-0.64) for given biomass, owing to the thermo-conversion of biomass in CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at 600-750\u00a0\u00b0C preferring to form the organic C with high aromaticity and low polarity. Nonetheless, thermo-conversion of biomass in CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> at 300\u00a0\u00b0C presented the greatest C sequestration potential, owing to high biochar yields under these conditions. Generally, the temperature-variability for the composition, EDR, and C sequestration potential followed the order: air-limitation\u00a0>\u00a0CO<sub>2</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0N<sub>2</sub>, whereas carbon stability presented an opposite order.
