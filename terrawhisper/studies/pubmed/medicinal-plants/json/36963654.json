The exact cause of MS is still not clearly known. Loss of myelin sheath and axonal damage are the main features of MS that causes induction of inflammatory process and blocks free conduction of impulses. Till date FDA has approved 18 drugs to treat or modify MS symptoms. These medicines are disease-modifying in nature directed to prevent relapses or slow down the progression of disease. The use of the synthetic drug over an extended period causes undesirable effects that prompt us to look at Mother Nature. Complementary and alternative medicine involves the use of medicinal plants as an alternative to the existing modern medical treatment. However, modern drugs cannot be replaced completely with medicinal plants, but the two types of drugs can be used harmoniously with later one can be added as an adjuvant to the existing treatment. These medicinal plants have the potential to prevent progression and improve the symptoms of MS. Various plants such like Nigella sativa, ginger, saffron, pomegranate, curcumin, resveratrol, ginsenoside have been tested as therapeutics for many neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this write-up is to make information available about medicinal plants in their potential to treat or modify the symptoms of MS. Chronically ill patients tend to seek medicinal plants as they are easily available and there is a general perception about these medicines of having fewer undesirable effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de Pharmacie.
