The essential oil content of 72 samples examined ranged from traces up to 1.69ml/100g of dry weight. Besides three almost scentless samples, the different \"mints\" are distinguished according to their prominent smell differences, i.e. samples with a pungent, musty and sweet type of smell. As a result, the commercial names attributed to them correspond to a particular type of smell and not to a particular taxon. A number of 29 medicinal uses were recorded in total. In most cases uses were not associated with particular taxa but were rather determined by plant smells. A literature survey has shown that the \"mints\" traded in Thessaloniki are also used as herbal medicines all over the Mediterranean area, with 67 different therapeutic uses. Among them the 22 uses, already mentioned by Dioscurides, show that the utilization of \"mints\" as herbal medicines in the Mediterranean countries has a long tradition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Systematic Botany & Phytogeography, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece. karousou@bio.auth.gr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karousou", "ForeName": "Regina", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balta", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hanlidou", "ForeName": "Effie", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kokkini", "ForeName": "Stella", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Greece"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Mentha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Names"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16962274", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.07.022", "S0378-8741(06)00361-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
