In study 1, rats were fed a semipurified casein-based diet and treated by gastric gavage thrice weekly for 2-wk with crushed garlic (0.7 g in 2 mL corn oil) or the carrier prior to DMBA treatment (50 mg/kg body weight). Providing crushed garlic reduced by 64% (P < 0.05) the quantity DMBA-induced DNA adducts present in mammary epithelial cells compared to controls. In study 2, microwave treatment for 60 s, but not 30 s, decreased (P < 0.05) the protection provided by garlic against DMBA-induced adduct formation. In study 3, allowing crushed garlic to stand for 10 min prior to microwave heating for 60 s significantly (P < 0.05) restored its anticarcinogenic activity. Microwave heating of garlic for 30 s resulted in a 90% loss of alliinase activity. Heating in a convection oven (study 4) also completely blocked the ability of uncrushed garlic to retard DMBA bioactivation. Study 5 revealed that providing either 0.105 micromol diallyl disulfide or S-allyl cysteine by gastric gavage thrice weekly for 2 wk was effective in retarding DMBA bioactivation but isomolar alliin was not. These studies provide evidence that alliinase may be important for the formation of allyl sulfur compounds that contribute to a depression in DMBA metabolism and bioactivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Nutrition and Nutrition Department, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milner", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "alliin lyase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammary Glands, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10082770", "10.1093/jn/129.3.657"]}}]}
