This is clearly seen in the Mediterranean world of Antiquity in every reference to the medicinal plants. Our aim, in this study, was to demonstrate the link between mythology and medicine. Through several centuries of medicinal practice, appears a therapeutic knowledge close to become a science. In spite of many gaps, errors and illusions thus emerges a first attempt to master the art of healing. Is it possible to speculate on a new type of drug research guided from ancient texts? Ethnopharmacology investigating medicinal traditions of the world has already obtained in this field some spectacular findings. At the moment, it would be difficult to predict the future of archeopharmacology but as Paul Valery said: \"Present is nothing else than a future nutriment for the past\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fabre", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9-Julien", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Mythologie et plantes m\u00e9dicinales de l'Antiquit\u00e9."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Hist Sci Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0225346", "ISSNLinking": "0440-8888"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Mediterranean Region"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mythology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Religion and Medicine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12797322"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
