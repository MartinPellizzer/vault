The seeds increased faecal fresh weight up to 100%, faecal dry weight up to 50% and faecal water content up to 50%. The husks, at the high concentration only, were more effective and wheat bran less effective. Length and weight of the small intestine were not greatly affected by the seeds, but both variables increased significantly in the large intestine. The husks had more pronounced effects, especially in the small intestine, and wheat bran almost no effect. Faecal bacterial mass as estimated from the 2,6-diaminopimelic acid output was increased to the greatest extent by the seed-containing diet and by the high concentration of husks, but to a lesser extent by wheat bran. Faecal and caecal protein content was enhanced by the seeds and wheat bran, but to a lesser extent by the husks. Total acetate in caecal contents or faeces was highest on the seeds and husks diet and not elevated by wheat bran. Total faecal bile acid excretion was stimulated and beta-glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) activity reduced by both Plantago ovata preparations, but not by wheat bran. Mucosal digestive enzyme activities were inhibited to different degrees by all dietary fibres in the jejunum, and sometimes activated in the ileum. These results suggest that Plantago ovata seeds are a partly-fermentable dietary fibre supplement which increases stool bulk; metabolic and mucosa-protective effects are also probable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Madaus AG, K\u00f6ln, Germany."}], "LastName": "Leng-Peschlow", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile Acids and Salts"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1662073", "10.1079/bjn19910035", "S0007114591000922"]}}]}
