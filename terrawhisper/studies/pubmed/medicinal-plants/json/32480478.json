In fully light-induced leaves, the actual efficiency of PSII photochemistry (\u0394F/Fm'), electron transport rate (ETR), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and photochemical quenching (qP) were lower in low-light-grown plants; this was also the case in fully dark-adapted leaves under a simulated sunfleck. In response to varied light intensity, high-light-grown plants showed greater quantum yields of light-dependent non-photochemical quenching (\u03a6NPQ) and PSII photochemistry (\u03a6PSII) and smaller quantum yields of fluorescence and constitutive thermal dissipation (\u03a6f,d). Under the simulated sunfleck, high-light-grown plants showed greater \u03a6PSII and smaller \u03a6f,d. There were positive relationships between net photosynthesis (Anet) and \u03a6NPQ+f,d and negative relationships between Anet and \u03a6PSII in fully light-induced leaves; negative correlations of Anet with \u03a6NPQ+f,d and positive correlations of Anet with \u03a6PSII were observed in fully dark-adapted leaves. In addition, more nitrogen was partitioned to light-harvesting components in low-light-grown plants, whereas leaf morphology and anatomy facilitate reducing light capture in high-light-grown plants. The pool of xanthophyll pigments and the de-epoxidation state was greater in high-light-grown plants. Antioxidant defence was elevated by increased growth irradiance. Overall, the evidences from P. notoginseng suggest that in high-light-grown shade-demanding plants irradiated by high light more electrons were consumed by non-net carboxylative processes that activate the component of NPQ, that low-light-grown plants correspondingly protect the photosynthetic apparatus against photodamage by reducing the efficiency of PSII photochemistry under high light illumination, and that during the photosynthetic induction, the \u0394pH-dependent (qE) component of NPQ might dominate photoprotection, but the NPQ also depresses the enhancement of photosynthesis via competition for light energy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Shuang-Bian", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Guang-Qiang", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Sheng-Chao", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Zhen-Gui", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Long-Gen", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Insitute of Sanqi, Wenshan University, Wenshan, 663 000 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhong-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Research Center on Good Agricultural Practice for Dominant Chinese Medicinal Materials, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, 650 201 Yunnan, People&#39;s Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guang-Hui", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Funct Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101154361", "ISSNLinking": "1445-4416"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32480478", "10.1071/FP15283", "FP15283"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
