Among the cornucopia of traditional medicinal plants, Curcuma longa rhizomes have been used as a powerful antibacterial and antifungal agent. However, its practical applications are limited due to its instability under thermal and UV radiation and its low bioavailability and the extensive procedures needed for isolation. This study focuses on exploring the potential of nanotechnology-based approaches to stabilize the natural curcuminoids, the major active components in turmeric without the need for its isolation, and to evaluate the release characteristics, stability and antimicrobial activity of the resulting nanohybrids. Natural curcuminoids were selectively encapsulated into nanolayers present in Mg-Al-layered double hydroxides (LDHs) using a method that avoids any isolation of the curcuminoids. The products were characterized using solid state techniques, while thermal and photo-stability were studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV exposure data. The morphological features were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Drug release characteristics of the nanohybrid were quantitatively monitored under pH 3 and 5, and therapeutic potentials were assessed by using distinctive kinetic models. Finally, the antimicrobial activity of curcuminoids-LDH was tested against three bacterial and two fungal species. Powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, SEM and TEM data confirmed the successful and selective encapsulation of curcuminoids in the LDH, while the TGA and UV exposure data suggested the stabilization of curcuminoids within the LDH matrix. The LDH demonstrated a slow and a sustained release of the curcuminoids in an acidic medium, while it was active against the three bacteria and two fungal species used in this study, suggesting its potential applications in pharmaceutical industry.Graphical abstractSynthesis of Curcuminoid-LDH by coprecipitation method and the slow release process of curcuminoids from LDH matrix."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chemistry, College of Chemical Sciences, Welikada, Rajagiriya, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Megalathan", "ForeName": "Ajona", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Kumarage", "ForeName": "Sajeewani", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Dilhari", "ForeName": "Ayomi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka ; Advanced Materials Research Center, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Weerasekera", "ForeName": "Manjula M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Samarasinghe", "ForeName": "Siromi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka ; Center for Excellence in Nanotechnology, Nanoscience and Technology Park, Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology, Pitipana, Homagama, Sri Lanka ; Advanced Materials Research Center, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Gangodawila, Nugegoda, Sri Lanka."}], "LastName": "Kottegoda", "ForeName": "Nilwala", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Cent J", "NlmUniqueID": "101314213", "ISSNLinking": "1752-153X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Moghadamtousi SZ, Kadir HA, Hassandarvish P, Tajik H, Abubakar S, Zandi K (2014) A review on antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity of curcumin.
