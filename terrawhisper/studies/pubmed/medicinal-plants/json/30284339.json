Anticholinesterase assays showed that all of the synthesized compounds displayed a clearly selective inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), but only a moderate inhibitory effect toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was detected. Among these cinnamic acid-tryptamine hybrids, compound 7d was found to be the most potent inhibitor of BChE with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04\u2009\u03bcM. This compound showed a 14-fold higher inhibitory potency than the standard drug donepezil (IC<sub>50</sub> \u2009=\u20097.79\u2009\u00b1\u20090.81\u2009\u03bcM) and inhibited BChE through a mixed-type inhibition mode. Moreover, a docking study revealed that compound 7d binds to both the catalytic anionic site (CAS) and the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of BChE. Also, compound 7d was evaluated against \u03b2-secretase, which exhibited low activity (inhibition percentage: 38%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft."},
