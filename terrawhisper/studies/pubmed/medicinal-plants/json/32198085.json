T. Chang or N. forbesii Boiss (Qianghuo in Chinese), a botanical drug that was adopted as a traditional Chinese medicine. NOT is suggested to show analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical practice. The inhibitory effects of NOT on human cytochrome P450 enzymes were investigated in the present study. Our results indicate that NOT inhibited the activity of CYP2D6 in a time-, concentration- and NADPH-dependent manner. The values of K<sub>I</sub> and k<sub>inact</sub> were 10.8\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.62 min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The calculated k<sub>obs</sub> at 10\u00a0\u03bcM was 0.29 min<sup>-1</sup>, above the 0.02 min<sup>-1</sup> risk level. After incubation with NOT at 10\u00a0\u03bcM for 9\u00a0min, approximately 92% of CYP2D6 activity was inhibited. Such loss of enzyme activity was not restored through dialysis, which indicates that the observed enzyme inhibition was irreversible. Partition ratio of the inactivation was approximately 29. Quinidine, a competitive CYP2D6 inhibitor, demonstrated protection on enzymes against the NOT-induced inactivation, but such protection was not found in incubation systems fortified with glutathione or catalase/superoxide dismutase. Additionally, CYP3A4 was observed to function as an enzyme mainly involved in the biotransformation of NOT. Taken together, these findings indicate that NOT served as a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2D6, meanwhile, those observed effects may induce the latent drug-drug interactions. The metabolic activation of NOT may be the key to trigger the inactivation of the enzyme."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
