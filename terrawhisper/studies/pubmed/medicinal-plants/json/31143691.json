Further, curcumin potential for cisplatin and doxorubicin (Dox) co-therapy was studied.", "The combined cytotoxic effect of these phytochemicals at varying dose ratios were examined using the MTT colorimetric assay. Moreover, the time-dependent toxicity of curcumin, cisplatin, Dox, and pegylated liposomal Dox (Doxil) was determined. The interactive anti-proliferative behavior of these compounds was examined using the CompuSyn software.", "Nanomicellar curcumin showed considerable cytotoxicity in C26 cells 24 hr post-treatment. Co-treatment of cells with curcumin nanomicelles: Gal had a synergistic effect in C26 (at 10:1 molar ratio), and Caco-2 (at 1:5 molar ratio) cell lines in cell cultures. Nanomicellar curcumin showed strong and mild synergistic inhibitory effects in C26 cells when co-administered with Doxil and cisplatin, respectively.", "Curcumin nanomicelles and Gal had a synergistic effect in C26 and Caco-2 cell lines. It is speculated that nanomicellar curcumin shows synergistic cancer cell killing if administered 24-hr post-injection of Doxil and cisplatin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Teymouri", "ForeName": "Manouchehr", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi Nik", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hanafi-Bojd", "ForeName": "Mohammad Yahya", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Mahmoud Reza", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ahmadi F, Shokoohinia Y, Javaheri S, Azizian H.
