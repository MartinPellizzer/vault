It contains many bioactive components. The present study aimed to assess the antimutagenic efficacy of a flavonoid fraction of Cajanus cajan (FFCC) to reduce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CP). We assessed genotoxic and cytotoxic effects using chromosome aberration, in mouse bone-marrow cells and spermatocytes, cell viability and DNA damage, in mouse bone-marrow cells. Animals received FFCC at concentrations 50,100 and 200\u202fmg/kg\u202fb\u202fwt by oral gavage, and injected simultaneously with CP (20\u202fmg/kg\u202fb\u202fwt) for 24\u202fh. The results revealed that FFCC was safe and its effect was normal compared to control group. Moreover, we observed significant inhibition of CP-induced chromosome abnormalities in both, somatic and germ, cells (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.05) after concurrent administration of different concentrations of FFCC and CP. FFCC reduced chromosome aberrations by 14.29%, 25.21% and 28.57% in somatic cells, and 25.35%, 35.21% and 49.29% in germ cells after simultaneous treatment with CP respectively. Additionally, FFCC improved the cell viability of bone-marrow cells in a concentration-dependent manner when administered concurrently with CP. Similarly, FFCC diminished DNA damage (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.05) in CP-treated animals. The inhibitory index of tail DNA (%) reached 90.6% at the highest concentration of FFCC when administered simultaneously with CP. In conclusion, the flavonoid extract improved cell viability and protected animal cells from the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects exhibited by CP. Cajanus cajan flavonoids might contain the antioxidant bioactivity that effectively lessened chromosome aberrations and DNA damage induced by mutagenic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
