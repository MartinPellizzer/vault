There was statistical significant (P < 0.05) difference between experimental groups and the normal controls. In addition, the telomerase activity of K562 cells was significantly inhibited by ORI at the dose of 3.43 micromol x L(-1) for 48 h. At the same time, the cell cycle distribution changed, the percentage of G0/G1 or G2/M stages cells increased and that of the S stage cells decreased after ORI was added.", "ORI can effectively inhibit telomerase activity in K562 cells.
