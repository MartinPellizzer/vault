Its species were identified by observing plant morphology and herbs appearance characters, preparing slices with routine methods and defining structural characters. According to the results of morphologic observation, leaves, stamen and pistil of this plant were different from the descriptions in Flora of China. The whole herb can be used in medicines, mainly including rhizomes, stems and leaves. According to the findings in the first study on microscopic structures, its rhizomes, stems and leaves were characteristic and worth identifying. The transaction tissue structures of rhizomes and stems were under developed and contained endodermis, secretory structures; Stems had sclerenchymata of different shapes of sclereids; Leaves were bifacial and had vascular bundles under midribs, which were surrounded by parenchymal sheathes. On the surface of leaves, stomata, glandular hairs and keratin lines were morphologically different in upper and lower epidermis. The herbal power had glandular hairs, sclereids and vessels. In conclusion, herbs of L. fortunei can be identified by the above histomorphological characteristics, which lays a foundation for further development and application of L. fortunei."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhi-gui", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Xiao-mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Sheng-fu", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Xiao-lan", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Cui-sheng", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Primulaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26137683"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
