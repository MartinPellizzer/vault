The present study was conducted to examine the effects of organic extracts from milk thistle (Silybum marianum), turmeric (Curcuma longa), reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum), and shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes) on innate immunity and tumor cell viability. 2. Innate immunity was measured by lymphocyte proliferation and nitric oxide production by macrophages, and the inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth was assessed using a non-radioactive assay. For measuring the cytokine levels in the HD11 macrophages which were treated with extracts of turmeric or shiitake mushroom, the levels of mRNAs for interferon-alpha (IFN- alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor superfamily 15 (TNFSF15) were quantified by real time RT-PCR. 3. In vitro culture of chicken spleen lymphocytes with extracts of milk thistle, turmeric, and shiitake and reishi mushrooms induced significantly higher cell proliferation compared with the untreated control cells. Stimulation of macrophages with extracts of milk thistle and shiitake and reishi mushrooms, but not turmeric, resulted in robust nitric oxide production to levels that were similar with those induced by recombinant chicken interferon-gamma. All extracts uniformly inhibited the growth of chicken tumor cells in vitro at the concentration of 6.3 through 100 microg/ml. Finally, the levels of mRNAs encoding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNFSF15 were enhanced in macrophages that were treated with extracts of turmeric or shiitake mushroom compared with the untreated control. 4. These results document the immunologically-based enhancement of innate immunity in chickens by extracts of plants and mushrooms with known medicinal properties in vitro. In vivo studies are being planned to delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for their mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal Parasitic Diseases Laboratory, Animal and Natural Resources Institute, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lillehoj", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "S I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lillehoj", "ForeName": "E P", "Initials": "EP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ionescu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mazuranok", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bravo", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silybum marianum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Reishi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Shiitake Mushrooms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20461582", "10.1080/00071661003745844", "922096871"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
