The MOF-based composite monolithic column was characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adsorption ability of MOF-based composite monolith for AA-I was compared with that of the polymer monolith without MOF added. The results proved that the addition of UiO-66-NH<sub>2</sub> can increase both the specific surface area and the permeability of the monolith. Moreover, the adsorption amount of AA-I on the monolith improved. This proposed on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) method showed good linear relationship in the range 0.044\u00a0~\u00a0400\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with r\u00a0=\u00a00.9994; the limit of detection (LOD) was 13.08\u00a0ng/mL and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 44.00\u00a0ng/mL; the intra-day and inter-day accuracies were\u00a0less than\u00a00.97%; the inter-column accuracies was\u00a0less than\u00a06.11%; the recovery was in the range of 91.11%~106.48%. The method was found to be easy, accurate and convenient for on-line enrichment and purification of AA-I in medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
