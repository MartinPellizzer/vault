In case of duodenal ulcer, the clinical symptoms were very well influenced after 20-day treatment in 65.5 per cent, well in 15.1 per cent, poorly--in 12.5 per cent and without effect in 12.5 per cent and the ulcer faded in 50 per cent, considerably reduced in size in 20 per cent and with no change--20 per cent of the treated (the effect on the ulcer was better, with statistical significance, as compared with the control placebo group). Gastric secretion was not substantially changed by the treatment carried out. The pain and dyspeptic complaints in cholelithiasis were favourably affected in 60 per cent of the treated but the peroral intake did not cope the cholelithiasis crises, rapidly and effectively. Verbascan eliminated and reduced the pains in half of the patients with dyskinesia of biliary ducts and colon, but it had no effect in the pains in the other halt. Verbascan was well tolerated, with no adverse effects, with a favourable ulceroprotective effect, hence it could be used in the treatment of the duodenal ulcer, cholelithiasis and dyskinesia of the biliary ducts and colon with moderate pains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dimitrov", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mendizova", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brailski", "ForeName": "Kh", "Initials": "Kh"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ivanov", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bozhiianov", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Klinichno izpitvane na preparata Verbascan pri lechenieto na niakoi stomashno-chrevni i zhl\u016dchni zaboliavaniia."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bulgaria", "MedlineTA": "Vutr Boles", "NlmUniqueID": "0032666", "ISSNLinking": "0506-2772"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "verbascan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Biliary Dyskinesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bulgaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cholelithiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Diseases, Functional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6356605"]}}]}
