We report that the <i>A. atemoya</i> leaves (AAL) have inhibitory effects on the pathogenesis and regulatory mechanisms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Ethanol extract of AAL prevented amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation and increased free radical scavenging activity. In addition, AAL extract exerted protective effects against neuronal cell death in HT22 hippocampal cells. Moreover, oral administration of AAL extract significantly improved memory loss in the passive avoidance task and Y-maze test, as well as downregulated the expression of neuronal markers neuronal nuclei and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in A\u03b2-injected AD mice. To verify the molecular mechanisms responsible for anti-AD actions of AAL, we conducted the antibody microarray analysis and found that epidermal growth factor receptor/G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 signaling was activated in neuronal cells and AD-like mouse models. Additionally, quantitative analyses of the six standard compounds using high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that rutin is the most abundant compound of AAL. Furthermore, efficacy analyses of six standard compounds showed that rutin and isoquercitrin had significant inhibitory activity on A\u03b2 aggregation. Taken together with biological activity and the content of compounds, rutin maybe a bioactive compound of AAL in the AD pathogenesis. Overall, our findings provide the first scientific support for the therapeutic effects of AAL in AD and AD-related disorders.", "Our study was aimed to find a novel candidate drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) using natural products. We assessed the effects of <i>Annona atemoya</i> extracts on crucial events in the pathogenesis of AD. <i>A. atemoya</i> leaf (AAL) extract significantly inhibited amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation, oxidative stress, neuronal cell death, and memory impairment through the epidermal growth factor receptor/G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 pathway. Simultaneous analysis using HPLC determined six standard compounds of AAL extract, and rutin was identified as a bioactive compound. Of note, the anti-AD activity of AAL extract was more significant compared to other extracts from medicinal plants of which efficacy was previously reported. The potential of AAL extract as an anti-AD agent may provide insight into the new drug development for AD treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Hye-Sun", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yu Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Eunjin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Jiyeon", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Bu-Yeo", "Initials": "BY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6529-1767"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Medicine Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 34054, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Jeong", "ForeName": "Soo-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Exp Biol Med (Maywood)", "NlmUniqueID": "100973463", "ISSNLinking": "1535-3699"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Annona"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cognitive Dysfunction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Array Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Yiannopoulou KG, Papageorgiou SG.
