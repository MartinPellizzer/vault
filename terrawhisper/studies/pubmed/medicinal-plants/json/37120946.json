Inflammatory mediators such as interleukins (ILs), interferons (INF-s), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 are related to an extended chance of inflammatory diseases initiation or progression due to the over expression of the nuclear factor Kappa B (NF-\u03baB), signal transducer of activators of transcription (STAT), nod-like receptor family protein 3 (NLRP), toll-like receptors (TLR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. These pathways are completely interconnected. Theindoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) subset of the kynurenine (KYN) (IDO/KYN), is a metabolic inflammatory pathway involved in production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD\u00a0+\u00a0). It has been shown that IDO/KYN actively participates in inflammatory processes and can increase the secretion of cytokines that provoke inflammatory diseases. Data were extracted from clinical and animal studies published in English between 1990-April 2022, which were collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane library. IDO/KYN is completely associated with inflammatory-related pathways, thus leading to the production of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, and ultimately development and progression of various inflammatory disorders. Inhibition of the IDO/KYN pathway might be a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. Herein, we gathered data on probable interactions of the IDO/KYN pathway with induction of some inflammatory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
