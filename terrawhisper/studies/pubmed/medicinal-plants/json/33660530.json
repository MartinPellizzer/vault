Hence, the interface between nanomaterial science and plant natural products may bestow comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for tackling diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. Natural product-derived carbon dots (NPdCDs) have revealed noteworthy attributes in the fields of cancer theranostics, microbial imaging, drug sensing and drug delivery. As plants consist of a cocktail of bioactive phytomolecules, the NPdCDs can be anticipated to have medicinal properties, biocompatibility, photo-stability and easy functionalization. NPdCDs have wide-ranging applications. The primary objective of this review is to comment on recent developments in the use of NPdCDs, with special reference to their application in cancer biology. The future of the use of NPdCDs has also been considered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5234-0021"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi\u00a0221005, India."}], "LastName": "Naik", "ForeName": "Gaurav Gopal", "Initials": "GG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi\u00a0221005, India."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Jainam", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmanza Herbal Private Limited, Gujarat 388435, India."}], "LastName": "Balasubramaniam", "ForeName": "Arun Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2378-6179"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering & Technology, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi\u00a0221005, India."}], "LastName": "Sahu", "ForeName": "Alakh N", "Initials": "AN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanomedicine (Lond)", "NlmUniqueID": "101278111", "ISSNLinking": "1743-5889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Dots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33660530", "10.2217/nnm-2020-0424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
