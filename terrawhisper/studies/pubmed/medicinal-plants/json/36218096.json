Allicin is the major agent of garlic that gives its known pharmacological activities as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and antioxidant agent. It could be extracted from bulbs of Allium sativum by water extraction to give allicin in low yield therefore other better methods were followed for extraction such as ultrasonic-assisted method that gives good yield. Attempts to optimize allicin extraction were found with sliced garlic at 25 \u00b0C for 90 minute of extraction for maximum yield (112\u03bcg/mL). Allicin was subjected to its evaluation as anti-herpetic against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and exhibited a promising activity compared to acyclovir which was used as a reference standard. On the other hand, a novel synthetic amantadine derivative was evaluated as antiherpetic agent and prepared from the reaction of 2-thiouracil-5-sulphonyl chloride with amantadine hydrochloride in pyridine. The synergestic effect of allicin and the amantadine derivative was evaluated against HSV-1, using both in silico molecular docking as for dynamics simulations. Thymidine kinase target enzyme was chosen to analyze any possible interactions, as well as any protein-ligand stability. Furthermore, some of properties of the potential HSV-1 thymidine kinase target inhibitor of the amantadine derivative were analyzed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Al-Zahrawi University College, Department of Pharmacy, Karbala, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Humadi", "ForeName": "Suhad Sami", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Helwan University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Awad", "ForeName": "Samir Mohamed", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural and Microbial Product, National Research Centre, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elkader El-Rashedy", "ForeName": "Ahmed Abd", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pesticide Chemistry, National Research Centre, Dokki, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Shehry", "ForeName": "Mohamed Fathy", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "59X161SCYL", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiouracil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BF4C9Z1J53", "NameOfSubstance": "Amantadine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymidine Kinase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4HES1O11F", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclovir"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acyclovir"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amantadine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiouracil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thymidine Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36218096"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
