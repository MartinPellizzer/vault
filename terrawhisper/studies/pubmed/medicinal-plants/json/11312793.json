The oil content differed greatly between the vegetative stage (0.13%) and the stage of full bloom (0.34%). Changes in the composition of yarrow essential oil were found to be related to maturation of the plant, with increasing amounts of monoterpenes in relation to the sesquiterpene. However, a clear trend could be detected only for the monoterpenic compounds with increasing levels of alpha- and beta-pinene and alpha-thujone and decreasing levels of sabinene, borneol, and bornyl acetate. Previously reported as major compounds, chamazulene and germacrene D could be found only in insignificant amounts. A solid-phase microextraction (SPME) procedure was applied for screening of the terpenic composition. Sesquiterpenic compounds such as beta-bisabolene, alpha-bisabolol, and delta-cadinene were detected in substantial amounts by SPME in contrast to the steam-distilled samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Plant Biocentre, Department of Botany, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, 7491 Trondheim, Norway."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rohloff", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skagen", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steen", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iversen", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11312793", "10.1021/jf000720p", "jf000720p"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
