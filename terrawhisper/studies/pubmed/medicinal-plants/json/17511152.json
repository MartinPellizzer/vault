Intestinal and myokinetic influence of normal and revulsive hyperactive gastrointestinal motility of mice induced by neostigmine were observated by giving aqueous extract and alcoholic extract of crude and processed Radix Aristolochice. Relieving pain and eliminating inflammation to mice also were observated.", "The LD50 of aqueous extract of crude and processed Radix Aristolochice were 146. 45, 846.06 g X kg(-1) (equivalently to crude drug) respectively by intragastric administration. Bandicoot' general condition, peripheral blood, serum, organic coefficient, histopathologic examination weren't obvious changes after 1 month administrating aqueous extract of crude and processed drug in three dose. Serum indicators-urea nitrogen, cholesterol total, alkaline phosphatase manifestly were heightened and some animals'hepatic cells, nephric tubules and mucosa emerged differently damage at histomorphology by giving crude high dose after 2 months. Above organs emerged different damage in crude middle and high dose and processed high dose after 3 months and serum indicators- creatinine, urea nitrogen manifestly were increased, the coefficients of liver, kidney and gaster manifestly were heightened. However, the toxicity of identical dose processed product was lower than that of crude one. Aqueous extract and alcoholic extract of crude and processed Radix Aristolochice could obviously inhibite normal and revulsive hyperactive gastrointestinal motility by neostigmine of mice, relieve pain in mouse, stretching and heat stimulation models and inhibite dimethyl benzene-induc mouse, auricle inflammation. Pharmacodynamic action wasnt obvious difference in same dose of crude product and processed one.", "Acute toxicity and chronic accumulated toxicity are stepped down after giving processed Radix Aristolochice, but pharmacodynamic effect wasn t lower.
