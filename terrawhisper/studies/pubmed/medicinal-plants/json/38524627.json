In this sense, non-native naturalized plants show more plasticity of morphological traits by adopting new habitat (an ecological niche) of the invaded habitats. This study focuses on the biomass allocation pattern and consistent traits-environment linkages of a naturalized <i>Datura innoxia</i> plant population along the elevation gradient in NW, Pakistan. We sampled 120 plots of the downy thorn apple distributed in 12 vegetation stands with 18 morphological and functional biomass traits during the flowering season and were analyzed along the three elevation zones having altitude ranges from 634.85\u00a0m to 1405.3\u00a0m from sear level designated as Group I to III identified by Ward's agglomerative clustering strategy (WACS). Our results show that many morphological traits and biomass allocation in different parts varied significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the pair-wise comparisons along the elevation. Likewise, all plant traits decreased from lower (drought stress) to high elevation zones (moist zones), suggesting progressive adaptation of <i>Datura innoxia</i> with the natural vegetation in NW Pakistan. Similarly, the soil variable also corresponds with the trait's variation e.g., significant variations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of soil organic matter, organic carbon, Nitrogen and Phosphorus was recorded. The trait-environment linkages were exposed by redundancy analysis (RDA) that was co-drive by topographic (elevation, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.4897), edaphic (sand, r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.4565 and silt, r\u00a0=\u00a00.5855) and climatic factors. Nevertheless, the influences of climatic factors were stronger than soil variables that were strongly linked with elevation gradient. The study concludes that <i>D. innoxia</i> has adopted the prevailing environmental and climatic conditions, and further investigation is required to evaluate the effects of these factors on their phytochemical and medicinal value."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Authors."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Malakand, Chakdara Dir Lower, P.O.
