We tested the hypothesis that these carbohydrates belong to a family of biologically active, plant-derived polysaccharides that can regulate responses to injury in animal tissues. C3H mice were exposed to 5 kJ/m2 UVB from unfiltered FS40 sunlamps and treated with between 1 pg and 10 micrograms tamarind xyloglucans or control polysaccharides methylcellulose or dextran in saline. The mice were sensitized 3 days later with Candida albicans. Tamarind xyloglucans and purified Aloe poly/oligosaccharides prevented suppression of DTH responses in vivo and reduced the amount of interleukin (IL)-10 observed in UV-irradiated murine epidermis. Tamarind xyloglucans were immunoprotective at low picogram doses. In contrast, the control polysaccharides methylcellulose and dextran had no effect on immune suppression or cutaneous IL-10 at any dose. Tamarind xyloglucans and Aloe poly/oligosaccharides also prevented suppression of immune responses to alloantigen in mice exposed to 30 kJ/m2 UVB radiation. To assess the effect of the carbohydrates on keratinocytes, murine Pam212 cells were exposed to 300 J/m2 UVB radiation and treated for 1 h with tamarind xyloglucans or Aloe poly/oligosaccharides. Treatment of keratinocytes with immunoprotective carbohydrates reduced IL-10 production by approximately 50% compared with the cells treated with UV radiation alone and completely blocked suppressive activity of the culture supernatants in vivo. The tamarind xyloglucans also blocked UV-activated phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK protein but had no effect on p38 phosphorylation. These results indicate that animals, like plants, may use carbohydrates to regulate responses to environmental stimuli."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. fstrickl@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu"}], "LastName": "Strickland", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Darvill", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Albersheim", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eberhard", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pauly", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pelley", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA-16672", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA-70383", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Photochem Photobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376425", "ISSNLinking": "0031-8655"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Delayed"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10048309"]}}]}
