In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the potential underlying mechanism of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47)-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. Our results showed that BDE-47-treated mice exhibited impaired cognition and robust upregulation of nuclear TDP-43 in the hippocampus. Hippocampus-specific TDP-43 knockdown attenuated hippocampal apoptosis, restored synaptic protein levels and thus improved cognitive dysfunction in BDE-47-treated mice. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation played a distinct role in the upregulation of nuclear TDP-43 by downregulating Parkin in the hippocampus of BDE-47-treated mice. Knocking down NLRP3 in the hippocampus or inhibiting caspase 1 activity in BDE-47-treated mice effectively increased Parkin expression in the hippocampus, which decreased the levels of nuclear TDP-43 and ultimately abrogated TDP-43-induced neurotoxic effects. Taken together, our data indicate that TDP-43 upregulation mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation via Parkin downregulation in the hippocampus induces cognitive decline in BDE-47-treated mice, and suggest that inhibition of NLRP3 or TDP-43 may be a potential strategy for the prevention or treatment of cognitive impairment in BDE-47-induced neurotoxicity and brain diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
