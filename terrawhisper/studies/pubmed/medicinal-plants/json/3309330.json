Crystals of one form grew as hexagonal plates measuring up to 150 micron across and 2 to 3 micron in thickness. Electron diffraction patterns of thin hexagonal plates showed sharp reflections to a resolution of 3.7 A on a hexagonal reciprocal lattice. The unit cell in projection (a = 127.0 A) and the symmetry of the diffraction pattern (6 mm) suggested that the hexagonal plates were highly ordered stacks of two-dimensional crystals suitable for structure analysis by electron microscopy and image processing. Crystals of a second form grew as dark green octahedra measuring roughly 0.5 mm across. Low-resolution X-ray diffraction patterns suggested a large cubic unit cell (a = 390 A). SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of single octahedral crystals showed the same polypeptide composition as the starting solution, one major band at 24,000 apparent molecular weight and two satellite bands of 23,000 and 23,500 apparent molecular weight."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pure and Applied Biology, Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, England."}], "LastName": "K\u00fchlbrandt", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3309330", "10.1016/0022-2836(87)90255-5", "0022-2836(87)90255-5"]}}]}
