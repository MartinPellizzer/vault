Rhubarb, which can improve nitrogen metabolism, may allow delay in the introduction of the hemodialysis. After performing diet therapy with an energy intake of 35 Kcal/kg and a salt volume of less than 7g in 38 cases with chronic renal failure (CRF), 5 healthy volunteers (N) and 5 cases with liver cirrhosis (LC), 1.0g of rhubarb was administered orally. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) did not vary in N, decreased in cases with LC and CRF (rhubarb-administered group), but increased in cases with CRF (non-rhubarb-administered group). The serum creatinine (s-Cr) did not vary in N and cases with LC and CRF (rhubarb-administered group), but was elevated in cases with CRF (non-rhubarb-administered group). Serum methylguanidine did not vary in N and cases with LC, decreased in cases with CRF (rhubarb-administered group), and increased in cases with CRF (non-rhubarb-administered group). The chronological level of 1/Cr in cases with CRF (rhubarb-administered group) was improved. In addition to the diet therapy, administration of rhubarb inhibited increase of BUN and serum creatinine in cases with chronic renal failure and was effective for the reduction of uremic substances. Therefore, it was concluded that rhubarb can retard the introduction-period of hemodialysis and can also inhibit deterioration of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Fukushima Medical College, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sanada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Jinzo Gakkai Shi", "NlmUniqueID": "7505731", "ISSNLinking": "0385-2385"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5L0H5Q9VAG", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylguanidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Failure, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Methylguanidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8828358"]}}]}
