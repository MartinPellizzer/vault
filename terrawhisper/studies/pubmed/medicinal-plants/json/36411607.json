Epidemiological surveys have shown that the number of children with precocious puberty has significantly increased globally. Precocious puberty negatively affects the physical and mental health of children and may increase the risk of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and infertility in adulthood. Therefore, the initiating factors of adolescence have become core issues in the study of sexual development in children. Owing to developments in molecular genetics, many studies have been able to show that precocious puberty is mostly resulted in autosomal inheritance. For instance, makorin ring finger protein 3 gene (MKRN3) may be implicated in familial CPP. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is the gold standard for treatment, but its safety still requires long-term evaluation and management. Traditional medicinal plants have been used in clinical treatments and in exploring novel treatment methods. From the collected datas, in Asia, traditional Chinese medicine treatment is based on the principles of nourishing Yin, lowering fire and draining fire from the liver to help precocious children and alleviate or delay the onset of precocious puberty by medicinal plants such as Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge., Phellodendron amurense Rupr., Rehmannia glutinosa and Poria cocos Wolf. They play an important role in exploring the pharmacological mechanisms of precocious puberty treatment effects and drug development. Therefore, by elucidating the occurrence and development of precocious puberty, this review provides novel and valuable insights of paediatric endocrine therapy accessing the published researches on the effectiveness of traditional herbal medicine in the treatment of precocious puberty and its therapeutic mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
