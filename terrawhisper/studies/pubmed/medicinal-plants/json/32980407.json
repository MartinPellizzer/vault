The structure, morphology, and physicochemical properties were characterized by various analytical techniques such as Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The desired catalyst showed great efficiency in the reductive degradation of methylene orange (MO) dye over NaBH<sub>4</sub> at room temperature. The MO was fully reduced in only 70\u00a0s and achieved rate constant of 9.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-2</sup>\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>. The catalyst was reused for 10 runs without significant loss in catalytic activity. Cell viability of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/agar/Au NPs was very low against breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), breast carcinoma (Hs 578Bst), infiltrating ductal cell carcinoma (Hs 319.T), and metastatic carcinoma (MDA-MB-453) cell lines without any cytotoxicity on the normal cell line. According to the above findings, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/agar/Au NPs may be administrated for the treatment of several types of human breast carcinoma in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
