Natural sources for <i>G. macrophylla</i> plants are being exhausted due to over-collection and need urgent conservation. The complete chloroplast DNA sequence of <i>G. macrophylla</i> (GenBank accession number: KY856959) was determined in our study. The size of chloroplast genome of <i>G. macrophylla</i> is 149,916\u2009bp, including a large single-copy (LSC) region of 82,911\u2009bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 17,095\u2009bp separated by a pair of identical inverted repeat regions (IRs) of 24,955\u2009bp each. A total of 130 genes were successfully annotated containing 86 protein-coding genes, 36 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. The GC content is 37.7%. 33 chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) of <i>Gentiana macrophylla</i> were detected, in which 32 of them are mononucleotide repeats. Phylogenomic analysis strongly supported the close relationship of <i>G. macrophylla</i> and other 5 species in Gentiana."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).
