In this study, we investigated the potential of Lactobacillus plantarum CICC 23121-assisted fermentation as an extraction tool for S. sphenanthera polysaccharides (SSP). We observed that 11.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28\u00a0% of polysaccharides were extracted from S. sphenanthera using strain CICC 23121 -assisted fermentation (F-SSP), which was 53.38\u00a0% higher than that using hot water extraction (NF-SSP). The optimized parameters were a fermentation time of 15.5\u00a0h, substrate concentration of 4\u00a0%, and inoculum size of 3\u00a0%. Lactic acid produced by strain CICC 23121 increased the release of intracellular polysaccharides by breaking down cell walls. Compared to NF-SSP, F-SSP contained higher and lower total carbohydrate and protein contents, respectively, and its monosaccharide composition was the same as that of NF-SSP; however, their distributions were different. F-SSP had a higher molecular weight, better aqueous stability, and looser surface morphology, and strain CICC 23121-assisted fermentation did not change the molecular structure of SSP. Both NF-SSP and F-SSP showed the potential to regulate human intestinal microflora. Our findings revealed that strain CICC 23121-assisted fermentation is an efficient method for extracting S. sphenanthera polysaccharides without affecting their physicochemical and bioactive properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
