Poir. by UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis and evaluating its anti-ischemic stroke effects.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "116275", "MedlinePgn": "116275"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Caragana jubata, belonging to the Leguminosae family, is a shrubby medicinal plant distributed in high-altitude areas of China. The red heartwood of C. jubata is the original source of 'zuomuxing', a Tibetan medicine that promotes blood circulation and removes blood stasis to treat different diseases associated with the blood.", "To date, research on the chemical constituents of C. jubata remains very limited. The anti-ischemic stroke (anti-IS) effects of this plant have not been studied. The aim of the present study was to analyze the chemical profile of C. jubata, establish various anti-IS models to comprehensively evaluate the anti-IS effects of C. jubata, and explore the mechanism of action.", "Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was chosen to analyze the chemical profile. A middle cerebral artery occlusion reperfusion (MCAO/R) model, zebrafish cerebral thrombosis model, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in PC12/BV2 cells were used to thoroughly evaluate the anti-IS effects of C. jubata. Additionally, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the mechanism of action.", "Fifty-three compounds were identified from a 95% ethanol extract of C. jubata (ECJ) by UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis. 17 and 7 compounds were identified from C. jubata and the genus Caragana for the first time. ECJ was found to attenuate infarct size and reduce brain edema and neurological scores in MCAO/R rats. ECJ notably reduced the zebrafish cerebral thrombosis incidence in a dose-dependent manner compared with that in the model group. Surprisingly, compared to the positive control drug aspirin, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ECJ exhibited a better therapeutic effect than aspirin at 30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Additionally, ECJ significantly increased the viability of PC12/BV2 cells injured by OGD/R. Moreover, ECJ inhibited the protein expression of M1 markers (TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and IL-1\u03b2) and increased that of M2 markers (Arg-1 and CD206) in OGD/R-injured BV2 cells. ECJ significantly decreased the immunofluorescence intensity of CD16 and increased that of CD206.", "The results from UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis showed that ECJ was rich in flavonoids. The results from pharmacological experiments verified the anti-IS effects of C. jubata in vivo and in vitro for the first time. In addition, ECJ could regulate the polarization of microglia. The present study highlights the medicinal value of C. jubata, thus providing a theoretical basis for the further development of new drugs from C. jubata to treat IS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
