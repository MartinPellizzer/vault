Plant-derived macromolecules are considered emerging therapeutic agents and an alternative to synthetic and small molecule drugs. Where it has long been known that plants possess medicinal properties, the compounds responsible for their action are in many cases still unknown: often only whole crude plant extracts or fractionated extracts are tested for the ability to inhibit common pathogens. Here, we present a fast protein liquid chromatography method for the separation of crude plant proteins. Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI; 24.2 kDa) and lectin (31 kDa) were purified from Glycine max by liquid extraction followed by ion exchange column chromatography. The need for serial chromatographic separation steps has been eliminated by introducing more complex elution profiles hence reducing cost, time and improving recovery. The identity of KTI-A and lectin was confirmed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Cell proliferation assays using B16F1 melanoma cells revealed that both KTI and the monomeric lectin retained some antiproliferative activity. This method could be useful for rapid and cost-effective purification of bioactive compounds from plant material."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.
