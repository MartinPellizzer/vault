The aim of the present study is to synthesize the ZnO NPs using Aloe vera leaves extract and to investigate the synergistic effects and antioxidant actions of biosynthesized ZnO NPs against gram-negative bacteria E.coli and K. pneumoniae. The synergistic effect of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (meropenem and ciprofloxacin) was tested along with ZnO NPs using Kirby's disc diffusion assay. The antioxidant activity was investigated by \u03b1, \u03b1-diphenyl-\u03b2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method.", "Results of the study revealed that the antibacterial activity of the selected antibiotics was much enhanced by ZnO NPs than the antibiotics alone. The resistant antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) became sensitive when combined with ZnO NPs. The antioxidant activity reveals that biosynthesized ZnO NPs possess significantly higher (p<0.05) antioxidant activity (77%).", "The findings reveal that biosynthesized ZnO NPs have a much more eco-friendly approach.
