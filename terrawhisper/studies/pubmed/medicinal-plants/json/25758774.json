Especially interesting for these industries are the substances that possess cell revitalizing and anti-ageing properties. The endemic plant Haberlea rhodopensis is known for its ability to withstand drought and to revitalize when returned to optimal conditions after a long time in desiccation. It is a mere fact that this plant not only can completely resurrect from a dried state but is also able to bring back the natural biochemical compositions of its cells. As a result H. rhodopensis offers a wide field for investigation of the exact mechanisms of the revitalization process as well as broadens the search for unique bioactive chemical substances in its cells. Here, by using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model we have demonstrated that methanol extracts from the plant H. rhodopensis hold specific properties to revitalize and ameliorate cellular growth as well as to balance intracellular metabolic states. Our results add valuable knowledge on the effects of natural compounds on ageing and reinforce the idea of using yeast as a model organism in the development of rapid tests for studying the efficacy of different bioactive substances."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Yeast Molecular Genetics, Institute of Molecular Biology \"Roumen Tzanev\", Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113, Sofia, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Georgieva", "ForeName": "Milena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moyankova", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Djilianov", "ForeName": "Dimitar", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uzunova", "ForeName": "Katya", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miloshev", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biogerontology", "NlmUniqueID": "100930043", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5729"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25758774", "10.1007/s10522-015-9566-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
