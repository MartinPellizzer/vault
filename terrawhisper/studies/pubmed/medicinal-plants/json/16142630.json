HPLC-NMR methods have a rapidly growing impact on natural products research by enabling structure determination of natural products directly from small amounts of extracts, i. e., prior to the investment in an often lengthy and laborious preparative-scale isolation process. This speeds up extract dereplication and helps to avoid re-isolation of already known extract constituents. Direct HPLC-NMR hyphenation techniques, defined as methods in which NMR spectra are recorded using the HPLC eluate, are described. The recently developed indirect HPLC-NMR method employing an automated solid-phase extraction interface between HPLC and NMR, which replaces the chromatographic solvent with a different solvent for NMR data acquisition, is described in the second part of this review."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Copenhagen, Denmark. jj@dfuni.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaroszewski", "ForeName": "Jerzy W", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Planta Med. 2005 Aug;71(8):689-90. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-871285", "PMID": "16142629"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "115"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16142630", "10.1055/s-2005-871298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
