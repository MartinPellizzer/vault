The expression level of FAS is related to cancer progression, aggressiveness and metastasis. In recent years, research on natural FAS inhibitors with significant bioactivities and low side effects has increasingly become a new trend. Herein, we present recent research progress on natural fatty acid synthase inhibitors as potent therapeutic agents. Objective This paper is a mini overview of the typical natural FAS inhibitors and their possible mechanism of action in the past 10 years (2004-2014). Method The information was collected and compiled through major databases including Web of Science, PubMed, and CNKI. Results Many natural products induce cancer cells apoptosis by inhibiting FAS expression, with fewer side effects than synthetic inhibitors. Conclusion Natural FAS inhibitors are widely distributed in plants (especially in herbs and foods). Some natural products (mainly phenolics) possessing potent biological activities and stable structures are available as lead compounds to synthesise promising FAS inhibitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jia-Sui", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Jie-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Guo-Qing", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b School of Medicine, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chao-Ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University , Chengdu , China ;"}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "He-Zhong", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.85", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acid Synthases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acid Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acid Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26864638", "10.3109/13880209.2015.1113995"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
