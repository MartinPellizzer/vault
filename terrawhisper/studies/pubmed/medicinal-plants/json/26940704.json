Since Apodytes dimidiata E. Mey. Ex Arn. (Icacinaceae) shows antioxidant potential, it may possess significant chemoprotective effects. Objectives The study investigated whether A. dimidiata could attenuate cisplatin-induced renal damage. Materials and methods Nephrotoxicity was induced by cisplatin (single i.p., 16\u2009mg/kg b wt.) in Wistar rats. Methanolic leaf extract of A. dimidiata (AMF) was administered at a dose of 250\u2009mg/kg b. wt. orally for 5 consecutive days before/after cisplatin administration. Blood and renal parameters were analysed. Total phenolic and flavonoid content in AMF and its NO scavenging effect was determined. Results Significant protective effect of AMF on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was observed in pre-treated animals. The reduction of urea, creatinine and lipid peroxidation was 58.31%, 42.19% and 60%, respectively, and the increase in haemoglobin and leucocyte count was 28.25% and 42.91%, respectively. The increase calculated for GSH, GPx, SOD and catalase was 35.64%, 18.14%, 74.42% and 35.46%, respectively. Tissue architecture of kidney was almost normal in AMF treated animals. The results were comparable to the standard drug, silymarin. AMF contained high level of polyphenols and flavonoids and was found to scavenge NO radicals (IC50 121.8\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Discussion and conclusion AMF can effectively counteract cisplatin mediated renal acute toxicity possibly by scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Accordingly, the study suggests that AMF can ameliorate free radical-induced damage associated with chemotherapeutic drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biochemistry, Amala Cancer Research Centre , Amala Nagar (Recognised Research Centre, University of Calicut) , Thrissur , Kerala , India."}], "LastName": "Divya", "ForeName": "Menon Kunnathully", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biochemistry, Amala Cancer Research Centre , Amala Nagar (Recognised Research Centre, University of Calicut) , Thrissur , Kerala , India."}], "LastName": "Lincy", "ForeName": "Lawrence", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biochemistry, Amala Cancer Research Centre , Amala Nagar (Recognised Research Centre, University of Calicut) , Thrissur , Kerala , India."}], "LastName": "Raghavamenon", "ForeName": "Achuthan Chathrattil", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biochemistry, Amala Cancer Research Centre , Amala Nagar (Recognised Research Centre, University of Calicut) , Thrissur , Kerala , India."}], "LastName": "Babu", "ForeName": "Thekkekara Devassy", "Initials": "TD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Nitrogen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26940704", "10.3109/13880209.2016.1149494"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
