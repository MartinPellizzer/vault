Among 600 species of this genus, Bauhinia variegata, B. purpurea, B. championii, B. racemosa, and B. forficata are commonly used in the traditional medicine and found to be throughly investigated for their medicinal properties. They possess diverse pharmacological activities such as anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-arthritic, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, fibrinolytic, and wound healing properties and most of the biological activities are corelating with traditional knowledge. Phytochemical analysis indicated that steroids, terpenoids, and flavonoids are prominent in the selected species, whereas bauhiniastatins, bauhinoxepins, racemosols, roseosides, and bauhichamines are found unique to the genus. This review aims to decipher active molecules from the aforementioned species of Bauhinia covering comprehensive analysis of phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and traditional uses. The data has been carefully analyzed to find compounds or fractions with a translational value. In most of the cases, the pharmacological activities have been established, however, further studies are needed such as safety evaluations, target identification, bioavailability, metabolite identification, and pharmacokinetic properties. In conclusion, the pharmacological potential of Bauhinia plants show promise with various leads such as insulin-like protein, roseoside, bauhiniastatin, and melibiose binding lectin. However, further investigations are required to address existing gaps and advance them towards product development. This review will lay the groundwork for future research initiatives aimed at fully realizing the therapeutic potential of Bauhinia plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
