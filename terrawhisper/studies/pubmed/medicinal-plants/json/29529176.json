The maximum tannase activity was observed on the third day of incubation at 35\u00b0C and the stability was observed at pH 5.5-6.0 by holding its 100% activity. The tannase was partially purified from A. nidulans [FT10] by ammonium sulfate precipitation at different concentrations, and it was found that at 80% of ammonium sulfate concentration, the precipitate exhibited the maximum activity for tannase of 96 U/ml. LCMS showed its M/Z value as 162.3 which was reconfirmed by SDS-PAGE. The UV spectrum and FTIR confirmed the presence of two oxy- and three hydroxyl groups in the benzene ring structure. The antibacterial activity of tannase was enhanced with antibiotics such as streptomycin and ceftazidime whereas the biofilm formation was significantly inhibited by the purified tannase. The scavenging activity was greatly increased with purified component and when the concentration of the purified tannase, FT10 was increased. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few reports where microbial species was used as the source for producing tannase enzyme and its role in various bioactivities such as antibacterial, anti-biofilm and antioxidant activity was evaluated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center [MAPRC], College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO box 2457, Riyadh 11451, KSA."}], "LastName": "Hidayathulla", "ForeName": "Syed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacogonosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO box 2457, Riyadh 11451, KSA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Department, National Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St., 12622, Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Shahat", "ForeName": "Abdelaaty A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center [MAPRC], College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO box 2457, Riyadh 11451, KSA."}], "LastName": "Alsaid", "ForeName": "Mansour S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center [MAPRC], College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO box 2457, Riyadh 11451, KSA."}], "LastName": "Al-Mishari", "ForeName": "Abdullah A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEMS Microbiol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7705721", "ISSNLinking": "0378-1097"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "tannase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus nidulans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29529176", "10.1093/femsle/fny051", "4909740"]}}]}
