The different contents of flavonoids in Mulberry Leaf and Mulberry Root-bark were also compared.", "The best condition for procedure was extracting 20 min at 60 degrees C with 12 times of 70% ethanol. Among all factors, the ethanol concentration was significant This experiment implied that flavonoids in Mulberry leaf were 9 times as that in Mulberry Root-bark probably. Moreover, the flavonoids extracted from Mulberry Leaf and White Mulberry root-bark by MAE were 55% and 32% more than that from commonly used extraction method individually.", "MAE is advantageous than commonly used extraction method.
