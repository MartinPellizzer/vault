Lung cancer is one of the leading types of cancer. The causes and prevention of lung cancer diagnosis have an important role as the inhibition of proteins in the initial treatment of the disease. The docking score was used to investigate the effect of some active compounds in traditional medicinal plants. The use of widespread medicinal plants and determination of active substances reveal the importance of docking studies in choosing the right active substance in a short time. The inhibition of essentially active compounds on lung cancer has been an important condition as the traditional medicinal plants that are rich in active substance and direct the experimental studies. In this study, the effects of the active ingredients in traditional food supplements used in many countries on the lung cancer were calculated based on the drugs used as standard. It will be hope that these active substances with high healing effects will be tested in the clinical field and turned into drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4363-3839"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Education, Department of Mathematics and Science Education, Faculty of Education, K\u0131r\u0131kkale University, 71450, Yah\u015fihan/K\u0131r\u0131kkale, Turkey. akgokalp@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "G\u00f6kalp", "ForeName": "Faik", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BAP-2016/016", "Agency": "K\u0131r\u0131kkale University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017/019", "Agency": "K\u0131r\u0131kkale University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018/033", "Agency": "K\u0131r\u0131kkale University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9435512", "ISSNLinking": "1357-0560"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "38"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33057857", "10.1007/s12032-020-01428-z", "10.1007/s12032-020-01428-z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
