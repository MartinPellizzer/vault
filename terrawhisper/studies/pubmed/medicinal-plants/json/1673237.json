Microorganisms associated with their fermentation and the organoleptic properties of the products were compared. Altogether, seven species of bacteria were involved in the fermentation. These included five Bacillus spp. and one species each of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Their occurrence vary between the seeds on the different days of fermentation. However, Bacillus spp. were present in all the seeds throughout the fermentation period. The sensory evaluation preference rating for the four products was highest for soybean condiment, followed by that made from locust bean. Melon condiment was the least preferred among the four products. Statistical analysis showed that there were significant differences (P less than or equal to 0.05) among the four products for each of the four organoleptic properties evaluated by the judges and also for titratable acidity. Glutamic acid level of soybean condiment was highest (0.31%) among the four products with that of melon being the lowest (0.04%). These results could serve as useful indices for the development of starter culture and optimization of production process in commercializing the production of these local condiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Jideani", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okeke", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ricinus communis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Condiments"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1970 Jul-Aug;18(4):576-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5433991"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1673237", "10.1007/BF02196379"]}}]}
