Diabetes mellitus is classified into two types according to the etiopathogenic mechanism and insulin dependence. Type 1 diabetes (T1D), an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is caused by damage and destruction of pancreatic \u03b2 cells that produce insulin. It is a disease that is characterized by hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia. Aronia berry has been used as a medicinal food in Europe. Aronia contains a variety of ingredients such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and tannins. Especially, anthocyanin content in aronia berry is known to be much higher than in other plants and berries. It is known for exerting antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-aging effects. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of aronia berry extract intake in multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D and to confirm the functional properties of aronia berry. ICR mice (6-week male) were divided into four groups: control (normal control group), STZ (100\u2009mg/kg of STZ-induced T1D group), AR 10 (STZ with oral administration of aronia 10\u2009mg/kg), and AR 100 (STZ with oral administration of aronia 100\u2009mg/kg). Afterward, STZ was injected in a single dose to induce T1D, and the extract was orally administered daily. Dietary intake and body weight were measured twice a week. We confirmed that aronia berry has the effect of decreasing the increase of blood glucose level and also has the protection effect of pancreas \u03b2 cell (RINm5F cell). This study confirms the anti-diabetic activity of aronia berry, and it can be expected to increase the utilization according to the results."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
