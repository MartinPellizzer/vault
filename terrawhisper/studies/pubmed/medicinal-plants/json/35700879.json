Biochar technology has been recognized as an important pillar for recycling of biomass, contributing to the carbon capture and bioenergy industries, and remediation of contaminated soil, sediments and water. This paper aims to critically review the application potential of biochar with a special focus on the synergistic and antagonistic effects on contaminant-degrading microorganisms in single and mixed-contaminated systems. Owing to the high specific surface area, porous structure, and compatible surface chemistry, biochar can support the proliferation and activity of contaminant-degrading microorganisms. A combination of biochar and microorganisms to remove a variety of contaminants has gained popularity in recent years alongside traditional chemical and physical remediation technologies. The microbial compatibility of biochar can be improved by optimizing the surface parameters so that toxic pollutant release is minimized, biofilm formation is encouraged, and microbial populations are enhanced. Biocompatible biochar thus shows potential in the bioremediation of organic contaminants by harboring microbial populations, releasing contaminant-degrading enzymes, and protecting beneficial microorganisms from immediate toxicity of surrounding contaminants. This review recommends that biochar-microorganism co-deployment holds a great potential for the removal of contaminants thereby reducing the risk of organic contaminants to human and environmental health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
