Fauripavine (1), with a munitagine pavine unit, is the first such dimer with an aporphine C-1 diphenyl ether connection; although fauridine (2), also the first of its class, has codamine, a benzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline, linked at the same position. Faurithaline (3) and its 3-methoxy analogue 4, both with reticuline, a benzyl tetrahydroisoquinoline as the second unit, are the first dimers with the diphenyl ether linkage at C-8 of an aporphine oxygenated at C-10 and C-11. Oconovine (8) was converted to 8-hydroxy-O-methyloconovine (12) to determine the effect of oxygenation at C-8 on the proton chemical shift of the C-7 hydrogens in a study to support the C-8 ether linkage of alkaloids 3 and 4. All the alkaloids have the S-configuration at their asymmetric centers as established from their CD spectra when compared with those of model compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1291, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doskotch", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1-510RR0145-01A1", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10395492", "10.1021/np980311b", "np980311b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
