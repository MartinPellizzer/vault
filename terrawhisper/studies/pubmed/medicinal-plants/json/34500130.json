Although five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for treating several cancers, there is still a huge demand on discovering new HDAC inhibitors to explore the therapeutic potentials for treating solid tumor cancers. Substrate mimics are a powerful rational design approach for the development of potent inhibitors. Here we describe the rational design, synthesis, biological evaluation, molecular docking and in\u00a0vivo efficacy study of a class of HDAC inhibitors using N<sup>\u03b5</sup>-acetyl lysine mimics that are derived from cysteine. As a result, compounds 7a, 9b and 13d demonstrated pan-HDAC inhibition and broad cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines, comparable to the approved HDAC inhibitor SAHA. Furthermore, 13d significantly inhibited tumor growth in a A549 xenograft mice model without any obvious weight loss, supporting that the cysteine-derived acetyl lysine mimics are promising HDAC inhibitors with therapeutic potentials for treating cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
