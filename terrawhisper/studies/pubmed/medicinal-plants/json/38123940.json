This study investigated DHTI-induced inhibition of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 with the aim to determine the potential effects of DHTI on the bioactivation of estradiol (E2), possibly related to preventive/therapeutic strategy for E2-associated breast cancer. Ethoxyresorufin as a specific substrate for CYP1s was incubated with human recombinant CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP1B1 in the presence of DHTI at various concentrations. Enzymatic inhibition and kinetic behaviors were examined by monitoring the formation of the corresponding product. Molecular docking was further conducted to define the interactions between DHTI and the three CYP1s. The same method and procedure were employed to examine the DHTI-induced alteration of E2 metabolism. DHTI showed significant inhibition of ethoxyresorufin <i>O</i>-deethylation activity catalyzed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 in a concentration-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.56, 0.44, and 0.11 <i>\u03bc</i>M, respectively). Kinetic analysis showed that DHTI acted as a competitive type of inhibitor of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, whereas it noncompetitively inhibited CYP1A2. The observed enzyme inhibition was independent of NADPH and time. Molecular docking analysis revealed hydrogen bonding interactions between DHTI and Asp-326 of CYP1B1. Moreover, DHTI displayed preferential activity to inhibit 4-hydroxylation of E2 (a genotoxic pathway) mediated by CYP1B1. Exposure to DHTI could reduce the risk of genotoxicity induced by E2. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 enzymes are involved in the conversion of estradiol (E2) into 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2) through oxidation. 2-OHE2 is negatively correlated with breast cancer risk, and 4-OHE2 may be a significant initiator and promoter of breast cancer. The present study revealed that dihydrotanshinone I (DHTI) competitively inhibits CYP1A1/CYP1B1 and noncompetitively inhibits CYP1A2. DHTI exhibits a preference for inhibiting the genotoxicity associated with E2 4-hydroxylation pathway mediated by CYP1B1, potentially reducing the risk of 4-OHE2-induced genotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics (Y.L., Y.C., J.Zha., G.R., Z.C., X.W., Y.L., W.L., J.Zhe.), Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution, Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education (J.Zhe.), School of Basic Medical Sciences (Y.L., Y.C., J.Zhe.), and School of Pharmacy (J.Zha., G.R., Z.C., X.W., Y.L., W.L., J.Zhe.), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China;
