We have earlier shown that a combination of calorie-restriction and chronic administration of the RC tea to the genetic diabetic (BKS-db) mice resulted in the normalization of blood sugar, reduction in lipid accumulated in the mice eyes and prevention of the degeneration of the otherwise brittle BKS-db pancreas. The tea is made by boiling foliage of Rauvolfia vomitoria and fruits of Citrus aurantium and is used to treat diabetes in Nigerian folk medicine.", "The RC tea was produced using the Nigerian traditional recipe and tested in the traditional dosage on 23 Danish type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. The participants were divided into two equivalent groups after stratification by sex, age and BMI, in a 4-month double-blinded, placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trial. Most of the study subjects (19/23) were using oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs). Mean disease duration was 6\u00b14.6 years, mean age was 64\u00b17 years and mean BMI was 28.7\u00b13.8 kg/m(2). Prior to starting the treatment, the participants received individual dietician consultations.", "At the end of the 4-month treatment period, the treated group showed an 11% decrease in 2-h postprandial plasma glucose relative to the 3% increase in the placebo group (p=0.004). The improvement in blood glucose clearance with RC tea treatment was reflected in a 6% reduction in HbA(1c) (p=0.02) and in a 10% reduction in fasting plasma glucose (p=0.02), when comparing the post 4-month treatment to pre-treatment baseline values. Though the basal levels of phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase enzyme in skeletal muscle were significantly reduced in the treated group (p=0.04), as compared to the placebo, only the pattern of reductions in the tissue fatty acids (FAs) differed in the two groups. While all types of FAs were reduced in placebo, only saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated (MUFA) FAs were reduced with treatment. Interestingly, a modest increase in the polyunsaturated FAs fraction was observed in the RC treated group. In addition, the reduction in SFA and MUFA with RC tea treatment came solely from the triglyceride fractions, as there was an increase in the skeletal muscle phospholipids.", "Chronic administration of the RC tea to overweight T2D on OADs caused significant improvements in markers of glycaemic control and modifications to the fatty acid profile of skeletal muscle, without adverse effects or hypoglycaemia. Further exploration of the anti-diabetic effects of the RC tea is warranted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
