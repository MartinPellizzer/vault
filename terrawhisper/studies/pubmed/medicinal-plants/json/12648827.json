As polysaccharides have been isolated from other plants that have a long tradition as woundhealing remedies, it was of interest to study the polysaccharides of T. emetica as well. The polysaccharides were extracted at 50 and 100 degrees C, and the polymeric material was separated into neutral and acidic polymers by anion exchange chromatography. The complement fixation ability of the different fractions was determined. The Acidic fraction 4 of the 100 degrees C extract was the most active, but most of the other fractions were also quite active. Structural studies showed that the most active fraction was a pectin of the rhamnogalacturonan type 1 with side chains of the arabinogalactan type II. Removal of terminal arabinofuranosides lead to a drop of the activity indicating that this structural unit may be involved in the bioactive site of the molecule."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Medicine, BP 1746, Bamako, Mali."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diallo", "ForeName": "Drissa", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paulsen", "ForeName": "Berit Smestad", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liljeb\u00e4ck", "ForeName": "Torun H A", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michaelsen", "ForeName": "Terje E", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-36-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement System Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Fixation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complement System Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mali"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Meliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12648827", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00330-6", "S0378874102003306"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
