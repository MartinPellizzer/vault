Turkey has a large potential for research on this topic due to owning broad ethnomedicinal experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East. Herbs that they have utilized for centuries to treat and prevent obesity can provide useful options to overcome this issue.", "This survey was carried out to disclose the inventory of plant taxa that the people of Turkey have been using for a few centuries in treating obesity without any side effects or complications, and to compare them with experimental studies in the literature.", "The research was achieved in two phases on the matter above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. Both results were shown in separate tables as well as the regional comparative analysis.", "117 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 74 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 49 (41.9%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-obesity activity. Quercetin (9.1%), gallic acid (6.1%) and ferulic acid and epigallocatechin gallate (4.5%) have been recorded as the most common active ingredients among the 66 active substances identified. Prunus avium (32.4%) and Rosmarinus officinalis (25.7%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Portulaca oleracea and Brassica oleracea emerged as the most investigated taxa in the literature.", "This is the first country-wide ethnomedical review conducted on obesity treatment with plants in Turkey. Evaluating the results of the experimental anti-obesity research conducted in the recent years in the literature, it was determined that forty-nine plants were verified. This clearly shows that these herbs have a high potential to be a pharmacological resource. Moreover, 68 (41.9%) taxa, which haven't been investigated yet, are likely to be a promising resource for national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
