In this paper, effects of repeated two doses of each drug and the combination of two drugs on these two cell lines were studied using relative clone-survival test. The inhibitory effects of Alt, MMC alone or combined on MGC tumor in nude mice were observed. No drug resistance was found when any one of the four agents at the same concentration were repeated twice separately at 60 hour interval in vitro. The cytotoxic effect of the repeated two doses was approximately equal to that of the single dose at double concentration. The in vitro test of combinations of two drugs showed that Alt plus MMC or 5 FU plus DDP had markedly synergistic effect on MGC cells; 5 FU plus DDP had markedly synergistic effect on SGC cells. The inhibition test on the growth of MGC tumor in nude mice indicated that the inhibition rates of Alt, MMC alone or combined were 58.3%, 86.3% and 84.3%. The systemic toxic effect of MMC alone was severe, whereas Alt alone or MMC plus Alt showed mild toxicity. For this reason, Alt plus MMC is recommended for clinical trials on poorly differentiated gastric cancer. In addition, for the comparison of in vitro test dose and clinical dose of each drug, the principle of clinical adult dose range (CADR) is proposed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "F Q", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "7910681", "ISSNLinking": "0253-3766"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0ZO1U5A3XX", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl trisulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U3P01618RT", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorouracil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorouracil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Transplantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2843330"]}}]}
