Oral doses producing the abortifacient effects were greater than or equal to 32 ml/kg when administered from the 15th-17th day of pregnancy. Similar effects were produced by intravenous doses of greater than or equal to 3 ml/kg. At the minimum effective oral dose of 32 ml/kg, those animals that carried the conceptuses to term (40%) had litters with reduced average number/litter and weight. At twice this dose, only 10% delivered and the litters were sickly. The effects of intravenous administration of the extract was similar but more pronounced and included also some unique acute effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana."}], "LastName": "Lutterodt", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50-56-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Death"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Resorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxytocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3419202", "10.1016/0378-8741(88)90112-2", "0378-8741(88)90112-2"]}}]}
