The causative mechanisms of cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury include renal inflammation, activation of p53 tumour suppressor protein and tubular apoptosis. Luteolin, a flavone found in medicinal herbs and plants, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticarcinogenic activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic effect of luteolin on cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury and the molecular mechanism.", "C57BL/6 mice were treated with cisplatin (20 mg/kg) with or without treatment with luteolin (50 mg/kg for 3 days). Renal function, histological changes, degree of oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis were examined. The effects of luteolin on cisplatin-induced expression of renal p53, PUMA-\u03b1 and Bcl-2 family proteins were evaluated.", "Treatment of mice with cisplatin resulted in renal damage, showing an increase in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, tubular damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Treatment of cisplatin-treated mice with luteolin significantly improved renal dysfunction, reducing tubular cell damage, oxidative stress and apoptosis. Examination of molecules involving apoptosis of the kidney revealed that treatment of cisplatin increased the levels of p53 and its phosphorylation, PUMA-\u03b1, Bax and caspase-3 activity that were significantly decreased by treatment with luteolin.", "These results indicate that cisplatin induces acute kidney injury by regulation of p53-dependent renal tubular apoptosis and that luteolin ameliorates the cisplatin-mediated nephrotoxicity through down-regulation of p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in the kidney."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine and Renal Regeneration Laboratory, Research Institute of Clinical Medicine and Diabetes Research Center, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Kyung Pyo", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Sung Kwang", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Duk Hoon", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sung", "ForeName": "Mi Jeong", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Yu Jin", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Ae Sin", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jung Eun", "Initials": "JE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramkumar", "ForeName": "Kunka Mohanram", "Initials": "KM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sik", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Moon Hyang", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roh", "ForeName": "Si-Gyun", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Won", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nephrol Dial Transplant", "NlmUniqueID": "8706402", "ISSNLinking": "0931-0509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Tubular Necrosis, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20817674", "10.1093/ndt/gfq528", "gfq528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
