Cell toxicity of CL on human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line JEC (JEC) cells was measured by MTT reduction test and growth curves drawing by trypan blue dye exclusion method. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration of cultured medium was detected by auto-biochemistry-meter. Cell differentiation was showed by detection of NBT reduction ability. Apoptosis was showed by AO/EB fluorescent staining and flow cytometer detection. Cell proliferation cycle was detected by flow cytometer.", "Comparing with the negative group, life span of EAC mice treated with CL was prolonged (P <0.05), and thymus index and spleen index of them were raised (P <0.05). The inhibitory effect of CL on JEC cells was in concentration-and time-dependent manner. IC50 of CL on JEC cells was 0.05 microg mL(-1) in 96 hours. Growth curves showed right-shift with CL concentration increasing. The number of NBT positive JEC cells increased and the LDH concentration of cultured medium declined with CL increasing. Apoptosis of JEC cells with CL treated was induced in concentration-dependent manner, apoptotic percentage of CL 10 microg mL(-1) on JEC cells was 25.59% in 24 hours. CL arrested JEC cells in G2-M phase (P <0.05).", "CL has certainly anticancer effects in vivo and in vitro. Anticancer effect of CL in vivo was in relation to enhancing immune function of EAC mice; anticancer mechanisms of CL on JEC cells may be its direct cytotoxic effect, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell segmentation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology of Guilin Medical College, Guilin 541004, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Zhi-kai", "Initials": "ZK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Li-mei", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-sheng", "Initials": "XS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endometrial Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17966364"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
