It is rich in phytochemical constituents, has nutritional significance, and possesses enormous pharmacological properties.", "This review has been established to highlight the importance of <i>C. dichotoma</i> G. Forst by providing comprehensive knowledge of its phytochemical, ethnobotanical, pharmacological, and toxicological aspects with a perception to foster pharmaceutical research to exploit its maximum potential as a therapeutic agent.", "Literature research has been accomplished using Google Scholar and databases like Science Direct, WOS, PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus with updates until June 2022.", "The work is an update on <i>C. dichotoma</i> G. and it reviewed and analyzed its phytochemical, ethnobotanical, pharmacological and toxicological knowledge from early human communities to contemporary medicinal and pharmaceutical applications with comprehensive examination of myriad plausible applications in the present-day scientific milieu. The species depicted the presence of diverse phytochemical profiles, possibly justifying its bioactive potential.", "This review will help lay grounds to facilitate state-of-art research intended to acquire additional information about the plant. The study offers opportunities to explore bio-guided isolation strategies for isolating and purifying phytochemical constituents that are biologically effective including pharmacological and pharmaceutical aspects to better understand its clinical relevance. Exploring pure isolated phytoconstituents for their mode of action including estimation of their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic parameters would be of considerable interest in assessing the attained pharmacological effect. Clinical studies are required to validate the suitability of its traditional usage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9699-4155"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sushruta School of Medical and Paramedical Sciences, Assam University (A Central University), Silchar, 788 011, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "Rati Kailash Prasad", "Initials": "RKP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cordia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37102483", "10.2174/1568026623666230427114318", "CTMC-EPUB-131258"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
