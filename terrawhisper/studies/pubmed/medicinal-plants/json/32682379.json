This was achieved through a study of the effects of processing factors, such as CS concentration, CS/TPP ratio, and pH of the CS solution, on PS, PDI, and ZP. Moreover, the obtained CSNS was evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, morphology. In addition, hemocompatibility and cytotoxicity using Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and MCF-7 cell lines were investigated.", "Box-Behnken Design factorial design (BBD) was used in the analysis of different selected variables. The effects of CS concentration, sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) ratio, and pH on particle size, Polydispersity Index (PDI), and Zeta Potential (ZP) were measured. Subsequently, the prepared CS nanoshuttles were exposed to stability studies, physicochemical characterization, hemocompatibility, and cytotoxicity using red blood cells and MCF-7 cell lines as surrogate models for <i>in vivo</i> study.", "The present results revealed that the optimized CSNS has ultrafine nanosize, (78.3 \u00b1 0.22 nm), homogenous with PDI (0.131 \u00b1 0.11), and ZP (31.9 \u00b1 0.25 mV). Moreover, CSNS has a spherical shape, amorphous in structure, and physically stable. Moreover, CSNS has biological safety as indicated by a gentle effect on red blood cell hemolysis, besides, the obtained nanoshuttles decrease MCF-7 viability.", "The present findings concluded that the developed ultrafine CSNS has unique properties with enhanced cytotoxicity, thus promising for use in intracellular organelles drug delivery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Faris", "ForeName": "Tarek", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kayyali Chair for Pharmaceutical Industry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Harisa", "ForeName": "Gamaleldin I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kayyali Chair for Pharmaceutical Industry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alanazi", "ForeName": "Fars K", "Initials": "FK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kayyali Chair for Pharmaceutical Industry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Badran", "ForeName": "Mohamed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics, College of Science, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alotaibi", "ForeName": "Afraa Mohammad", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, United States."}], "LastName": "Almanea", "ForeName": "Hafsa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic, and Poisonous Plants Research Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Ali S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Samy", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "101208455", "ISSNLinking": "1567-2018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32682379", "10.2174/1567201817666200719005440", "CDD-EPUB-108259"]}}]}
