Once the dose-response relationship was established, 3% garlic powder or 63 or 180 mg/kg copper as cupric citrate or cupric sulfate pentahydrate were supplemented to the diet (Experiments 3, 4, 5, and 6). In the first two experiments, reductions of plasma cholesterol (P = 0.006) and triacylglycerols (P = 0.013) and liver (P = 0.012) and breast muscle (P = 0.165) cholesterol were observed in garlic-supplemented birds. Feeding either garlic powder or copper (63 and 180 mg/kg) resulted in reduced levels of plasma cholesterol, liver cholesterol, blood reduced glutathione, and breast and thigh muscle cholesterol. Differences were significant at P < 0.05 in at least one experiment. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase activity was decreased due to dietary garlic (P = 0.0369), but not by pharmacological levels of dietary copper (P = 0.982). The activity of fatty acid synthetase was decreased in birds fed copper (P = 0.035). Both garlic and copper supplements decreased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity (P = 0.024 and P = 0.022, respectively). The results of these trials confirm the findings that garlic and copper alter lipid and cholesterol metabolism. However, they do not work by the same mechanism. Feeding dietary garlic or copper for 21 d reduced cholesterol levels of broiler meat without altering growth of the chickens or feed efficiency."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Poultry Science, University of Georgia, Athens 30602-2772, USA."}], "LastName": "Konjufca", "ForeName": "V H", "Initials": "VH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pesti", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bakalli", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.23", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.85", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acid Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol 7-alpha-Hydroxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acid Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9276889", "10.1093/ps/76.9.1264", "S0032-5791(19)40683-4"]}}]}
