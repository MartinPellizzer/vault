(DBL), a traditional Chinese medicine, is a well-known herb with hepatotoxicity, and the biochemical mechanisms of the toxic action remain unknown. Diosbulbin B (DSB), a major component of DBL, can induce severer liver injury which requires cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation of the furan ring. It is reported that a <i>cis</i>-enedial reactive intermediate resulting from metabolic activation of DSB can react with thiols and amines to form pyrrole or pyrroline derivatives. In this study, we investigated the interaction of the reactive intermediate with polyamines, biogenic amines, and amino acids involved in the polyamine metabolic pathway, including putrescine, spermidine, spermine, histamine, arginine, ornithine, lysine, glutamine, and asparagine. Seven DSB-derived amine adducts were detected in microsomal incubations supplemented with DSB and individual amines. Six adducts were observed in cultured rat primary hepatocytes after exposure to DSB. DSB was found to induce apoptosis and cell death in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Apparently, the observed apoptosis was associated with the detected amine adduction. The findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of toxic action of DSB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhengyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yukun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zixia", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Shenzhi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0340-0275"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.
