In particular, the cancer cell invasion and SMC migration through vascular wall were shown to be directly associated with inducible MMP-9 expression. Previously, 3,4,5-trihydoroxybenzaldehyde (THBA) was purified from Geum japonicum and we demonstrated a direct inhibition effect of THBA on MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity in the supernatants of TNF-alpha-induced HASMCs. In addition, MMP-9 expression and migration was suppressed by THBA in the TNF-alpha-induced HASMCs. In this study, we also investigated whether TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 expressions are involved with migrations of HASMCs by using cell signal inhibitors and MMP-9 inhibitors. An RT-PCR and luciferase-tagged promoter analysis revealed that THBA inhibits the transcription of MMP-9 mRNA. Moreover, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) exhibited that THBA also suppressed DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activator protein (AP)-1 transcription factors. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were inhibited by THBA. Taken together, we suggest that THBA has inhibition effect to the migrations as well as MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities in HASMCs. Especially gelatinolytic activity was controlled by enzymatic inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and also down-regulated MMP-9 transcription via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in THBA treated HASMCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Science, Sungkyunkwan University, Jangan-Gu, Suwon City, Kyunggi-Do 440-746, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "Seok-Jong", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Kang Jin", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "Tae Chul", "Initials": "TC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Hyeun-Wook", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Young-Guk", "Initials": "YG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheorl-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4,5-trihydroxybenzaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-70-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Gelatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.35", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gelatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Geum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Signaling System"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 9"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18773430", "10.1002/jcb.21854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
