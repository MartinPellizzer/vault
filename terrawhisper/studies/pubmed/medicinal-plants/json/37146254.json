In this study, we constructed a plasmid-free 3PPA-producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> strain and designed a novel 3PPAAc biosynthetic pathway. A module containing tyrosine ammonia lyase and enoate reductase, evaluated under the control of different promoters, was combined with phenylalanine-overproducing strain <i>E. coli</i> ATCC31884, enabling the plasmid-free <i>de novo</i> production of 218.16 \u00b1 43.62 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 3PPA. The feasibility of the pathway was proved by screening four heterologous alcohol acetyltransferases, which catalyzed the transformation of 3-phenylpropyl alcohol into 3PPAAc. Afterward, 94.59 \u00b1 16.25 mg L<sup>-1</sup> 3PPAAc was achieved in the engineered <i>E. coli</i> strain. Overall, we have not only demonstrated the potential of <i>de novo</i> synthesis of 3PPAAc in microbes for the first time but also provided a platform for the future of biosynthesis of other aromatic compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2040-1066"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Qingfang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Shilian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Sciences, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rongpeng", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5Q445IN5CU", "NameOfSubstance": "3-phenylpropionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AKW166708I", "NameOfSubstance": "3-phenylpropyl acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylpropionates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylpropionates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37146254", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00330"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
