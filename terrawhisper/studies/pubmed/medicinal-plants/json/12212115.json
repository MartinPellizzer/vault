The results showed that after 1-month treatment, symptoms and signs, such as joint tenderness, arthralgia, arthroncus, of patients in BZXG improved notably(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while those of patients in MTXG did not improve, there was significant difference between these two groups(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). After 3-month treatment, these symptoms and signs improved in both groups(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), but BZX had a better effect than MTX. ESR, CRP, RF, C3, IgG, IgA and IgM decreased significantly in both groups after treatment(P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), ESR, CRP in BZXG decreased more and faster than those in MTXG. In BZXG the obviously efficient rat was 70%, the total efficacy rate was 94%, while in MTXG was 52% and 87% respectively. It is indicated that BZX can improve symptoms and signs of patients with RA, has better and faster effects on acute phase reaction than MTX; and it has anti-immunologic effects similar to MTX, and has no obvious side effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Combined Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Hunan Medical University, Changsha 410008."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Hunan Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9424769", "ISSNLinking": "1000-5625"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YL5FZ2Y5U1", "NameOfSubstance": "Methotrexate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Rheumatoid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Methotrexate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12212115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
