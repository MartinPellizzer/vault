The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) have acknowledged sickle cell disease as a significant global public health concern. Unfortunately, a cure for this condition is yet to be discovered, and existing allopathic treatments, while offering relief, come with serious side effects. In recent times, there has been a growing interest in exploring the potential of medicinal plants for treating sickle cell disease due to their content of secondary metabolites that may impact the disease's mechanisms. Cajanus cajan, a crucial grain legume in rain-fed agriculture in semi-arid tropics, has been traditionally used in folk medicine to manage various illnesses and is suggested to possess anti-sickling properties.", "The present study investigated two varieties of C. cajan for their effectiveness in treating sickle cell beta thalassemia, a variant of sickle cell disease.", "The study was divided into four groups consisting of the untreated group (group 1), group treated with standard drug (group 2), group treated with white C. cajan (group 3) and group treated with brown C. cajan (group 4). The effects of the two variety of C. cajan were measured by polymerization test, reversibility test, osmotic fragility test, deoxygenation and beta globin synthesis test.", "The results revealed that both varieties of C. cajan demonstrated a reduction in polymerization rates, reversed sickled red blood cells, increased the oxygen affinity of Hb-S/\u03b2, elevated the Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> ratio, and maintained the membrane stability of red blood cells. Notably, the white variety exhibited superior anti-sickling properties compared to the brown variety.", "This suggests that this significant leguminous crop could be utilized for the treatment and management of sickling disorders, particularly in low-income countries where conventional treatments may be financially inaccessible to patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
