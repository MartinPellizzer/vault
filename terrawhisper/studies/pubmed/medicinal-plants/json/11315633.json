The SeMV genome is 4149 nucleotides in length and encodes four potential overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Comparison of the nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the four ORFs of SeMV with that of other sobemoviruses revealed that SeMV was closest to southern bean mosaic virus Arkansas isolate (SBMV-Ark, 73% identity). The 5' non-coding regions of SeMV, SBMV and southern cowpea mosaic virus (SCPMV) are nearly identical. However ORF1 of SeMV which encodes for a putative movement protein of M(r) 18370 has only 34% identity with SBMV-Ark. ORF 2 encodes a polyprotein containing the serine protease, genome linked viral protein (VPg) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase domains and shows 78% identity with SBMV-Ark. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of VPg was found to be TLPPELSIIEIP, which mapped to the region 326-337 of ORF2 product and the cleavage site between the protease domain and VPg was identified to be E325-T326. The cleavage site between VPg and RNA dependent RNA polymerase was predicted to be E445-T446 based on the amino acid sequence analysis of the polyprotein from different sobemoviruses. ORF3 is nested within ORF2 in a--1 reading frame. The potential ribosomal frame shift signal and the downstream stem-loop structure found in other sobemoviruses are also conserved in SeMV RNA sequence, indicating that ORF3 might be expressed via--1 frame shifting mechanism. ORF4 encodes the coat protein of SeMV, which shows 76 and 66% identity with SBMV-Ark and SCPMV, respectively. Thus the comparison of the non-coding regions and the ORFs of SeMV with other sobemoviruses clearly revealed that it is not a strain of SBMV. Phylogenetic analysis of six different sobemoviruses, including SeMV, suggests that recombination event is not frequent in this group and that SeMV is a distinct member of the genus sobemovirus. The analysis also shows sobemoviruses infecting monocotyledons and dicotyledons fall into two distinct clusters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lokesh", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gopinath", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satheshkumar", "ForeName": "P S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Savithri", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AY004291"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Codon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Codon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11315633", "10.1007/s007050170170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
