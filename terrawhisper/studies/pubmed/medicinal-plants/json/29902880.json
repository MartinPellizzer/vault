Their structures were elucidated based on the analysis of spectroscopic data (1D, 2D NMR and HR-MS). Compound 1 is a new compound, named as angustifol A. Six known compounds were identified as 2-phenylethyl-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside(2), salidroside (3), vanillic acid 4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside(4), vanilloloside (5), (Z)-isoconiferin (6), 2-phenylethyl-6-O-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranosyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (7).
