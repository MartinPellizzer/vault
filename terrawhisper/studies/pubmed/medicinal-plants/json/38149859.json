DNA methylation is an epigenetic dysregulation that plays a critical role in leukemogenesis. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) such as DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B are the key enzymes catalysing DNA methylation. Inhibition of DNMT1 with secondary metabolites from medicinal plants helps reverse DNA methylation. The present study focuses on inhibiting DNMT1 protein (PDB ID: 3PTA) with annonaceous acetogenins through <i>in-silico</i> studies. The docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study was carried out using Schr\u00f6dinger Maestro and Desmond, respectively. These compounds' drug likeliness, ADMET properties and bioactivity scores were analysed. About 76 different acetogenins were chosen for this study, among which 17 showed the highest binding energy in the range of -8.312 to -10.266\u2009kcal/mol. The compounds with the highest negative binding energy were found to be annohexocin (-10.266\u2009kcal/mol), isoannonacinone (-10.209\u2009kcal/mol) and annonacin (-9.839\u2009kcal/mol). MD simulation results reveal that annonacin remains stable throughout the simulation time of 100\u2009ns and also binds to the catalytic domain of DNMT1 protein. From the above results, it can be concluded that annonacin has the potential to inhibit the DNA methylation process and prevent leukemogenesis.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
