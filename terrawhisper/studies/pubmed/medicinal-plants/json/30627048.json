Four different extraction techniques <i>viz</i>. percolation, agitation with heat, sonication and soxhlet using five solvent systems as ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, methanol and methanol:water (8:2) were evaluated. In these studies, it was observed that maximum extract yield was obtained using in methanol and methanol/water mixture as extracting solvent by soxhlet technique although the content of total momilactones A and B was higher in the methanol/water mixture in comparison to other extractions. The successive and simple isolation enrichment technique for momilactones A and B were achieved by solid-matrix partitioning after the treatment of methanolic extract with charcoal and using ethyl acetate as extracting solvent for momilactones A and B. The quantitative analysis of the extraction and enrichment development protocol was validated by a simple, accurate, reproducible RP-HPLC-UV-VIS method using a binary gradient elution comprising of acetonitrile and water (70:30). The separation was achieved on a waters Spherisorb S10 ODS 2 column (250\u202f\u00d7\u202f4.6\u202fmm, I.D., 10\u202f\u00b5m) that achieved a greater degree of linearity within an overall concentration of extracts and momilactones A and B, 1\u202fmg\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup> and higher degree of correlation (0.9928\u202f\u2264\u202fr<sup>2</sup>\u202f\u2264\u202f0.9936) for momilactones A and B. So far, comparative extraction of momilactones A and B and HPLC of these compounds has not been reported. Standards of momilactones A (<b>1</b>) and B (<b>2</b>) were isolated along with other two compounds as orizaterpenoid (<b>3</b>) and 7-ketostigmaterol (<b>4</b>) from ethyl acetate extract of rice hulls of <i>O. sativa</i> and checked purity by HPLC-PDA-MS and identification of these isolated compounds (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) by complete spectroscopic techniques as IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, 2D NMR and HR-MS. The qualitative analysis of momilactone A and B separation technique by thin layer chromatography was also developed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Process Chemistry and Technology Department, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Previously in Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Hiroshima 739-8259, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Ateeque", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Hiroshima 739-8259, Japan."}], "LastName": "Xuan", "ForeName": "Tran Dang", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School for International Development and Cooperation, Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Hiroshima 739-8259, Japan."}], "LastName": "Minh", "ForeName": "Truong Ngoc", "Initials": "TN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, P.O.
