In addition, skin biopsy specimens from patients were studied for in vitro mast-cell histamine release with tomato distillate alone or on subsequent stimulation with anti-IgE, substance P, and C5a.", "Seventy-six percent of patients reacted to whole tomato (steam distillate, 45%; residue, 15%), 50% to food additives, 47% to herbs, and 44% to whole wine (extract, 27%; residue, 0%). Histamine, protein, and high levels of salicylate were only found in residues. The tomato distillate was further analyzed by means of mass spectroscopy, identifying low molecular-weight aldehydes, ketones, and alcohol as major ingredients. In vitro histamine release was not caused by tomato extract itself but was enhanced by means of subsequent stimulation with substance P and C5a but not by anti-IgE.", "Aromatic volatile ingredients in food are novel agents eliciting PARs in chronic urticaria. Histamine, salicylate, and a direct mast-cell histamine release are not involved in this reactivity to naturally occurring pseudoallergens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Charit\u00e9, Humboldt University, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zuberbier", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pfrommer", "ForeName": "Christine", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Specht", "ForeName": "Kirsten", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vieths", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bastl-Borrmann", "ForeName": "Renate", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Worm", "ForeName": "Margitta", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Henz", "ForeName": "Beate M", "Initials": "BM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Release"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Urticaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11842307", "10.1067/mai.2002.121309", "S0091674902198770"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
