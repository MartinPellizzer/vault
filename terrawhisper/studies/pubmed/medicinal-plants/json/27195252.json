The increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) worldwide highlights the urgent need to search for alternative antimycobacterial agents. More and more people in developing countries utilize traditional medicine for their major primary health care needs. It has been determined that the medicinal plants Pulicaria gnaphalodes and Perovskia abrotanoides possess strong antibacterial effect.", "In this study, the antimycobacterial effects of P. gnaphalodes and P. abrotanoides essential oil on MTB were examined. Essential oil was prepared from P. gnaphalodes aerial parts and P. abrotanoides flower. The effects of six different concentrations (20 \u03bcg/ml, 40 \u03bcg/ml, 80 \u03bcg/ml, 160 \u03bcg/ml, 320 \u03bcg/ml, and 640 \u03bcg/ml) were examined against sensitive isolates of MTB and MTB H37Rv (ATCC 27294).", "The results showed that P. gnaphalodes and P. abrotanoides essential oil extracts have strong inhibitory effects on MTB. This activity for P. gnaphalodes was observed from very low (4%) to good (70.9%) effect; meanwhile, this activity for P. abrotanoides was observed from very low (4%) to strong (86%) effect.", "The mean of inhibition percentage for P. gnaphalodes and P. abrotanoides in 640 \u03bcg/ml was 58.1% and 76.2%, respectively. So, P. abrotanoides plant is more effective against MTB than P. gnaphalodes. Identification of the effective fraction against MTB is a further step to be studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hozoorbakhsh", "ForeName": "Fereshte", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esfahani", "ForeName": "Bahram Nasr", "Initials": "BN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghim", "ForeName": "Sharareh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Isfahan Pharmaceutical Science Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asghari", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101586897", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9175"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "WHO Library Cataloguing-in-Publication Data Global tuberculosis controls.
