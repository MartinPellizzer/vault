The quality of herbal ingredients can be affected by environmental factors.", "To evaluate the quality of wild S. miltiorrhiza and investigate the influence of soil constituents and parameters as well as climatic conditions and factors on the content of Tan IIA and Sal Acid B.", "We collected samples in 12 natural locations in the Dao Di area in China, the area in which S. miltiorrhiza grows, that results in a distinctive higher quality of medicinal materials from the harvested plant. The concentrations of Tan IIA and Sal Acid B were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Soil total carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, and particle size distribution were determined. We also collected climate data using ArcGIS from the WorldClim database, and correlation tests, redundancy, and regression analyses were conducted to analyse the relationship and cluster the samples according to their chemical profile.", "The content of Tan IIA and Sal Acid B in most of the samples was significantly different (P < 0.05). Soil available phosphorus was considered as a key factor that influenced the quality of wild S. miltiorrhiza, and we found a significant negative association between the concentration of Tan IIA in roots and soil available phosphorus. Moreover, the accumulation of Tan IIA in S. miltiorrhiza was also significantly associated with precipitation in April, May, and October, maximum temperature in January, and standard deviation of temperature seasonality. There was no significant correlation between the content of Sal Acid B and ecological factors. In addition, samples collected from Mengshan, Hexian, and Lushi locations were rich in Tan IIA and tended to cluster together, whereas samples collected from Longquan and Huoshan locations tended to cluster and were poor in Tan IIA.", "The Tan IIA content in samples collected from southern Anhui was significantly lower than that in other Dao Di locations. The content of Tan IIA was related more to the soil than the temperature. Compared with Tan IIA, Sal Acid B was less influenced by soil and climate factors. The findings of this study may provide helpful references for quality control of medicinal plants that exert pharmacological effects in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0280-7716"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Applied Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology, Sanmenxia, Henan, P.
