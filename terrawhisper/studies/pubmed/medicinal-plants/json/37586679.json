This study investigated myricitrin, a flavonol-3-O-rhamnoside, for its binding affinity to CATD. Molecular docking experiments revealed a strong binding affinity (-7.8\u00a0kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed the complex's stability, while enzyme activity studies showed inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 35.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.08\u00a0\u03bcM (in cell-free) and 16.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.48\u00a0\u03bcM (in cell-based) test systems. Expression analysis indicated downregulation of CATD with a fold change of 1.35. Myricitrin demonstrated antiproliferative effects on NCIH-520\u00a0cells [IC<sub>50</sub>: 64.11\u00a0\u03bcM in Sulphorhodamine B (SRB), 24.44\u00a0\u03bcM in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)], but did not affect healthy CHANG cells. It also prolonged the G2/M phase (at 10\u00a0\u03bcM: 1.19-fold; at 100\u00a0\u03bcM: 1.13-fold) and increased sub-diploid population by 1.35-fold. Based on the analysis done using SwissADME program, it is predicted that myricitrin is not a cytochrome p450s (CYPs) inhibitor, followed the rule of Ghose and found not permeable to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which suggests it as a safe molecule. In summary, the experimental findings may establish the foundation for myricitrin and its analogues to be used therapeutically in CATD-mediated lung cancer prevention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
