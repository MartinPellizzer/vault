Eighty-three cattle farmers from nine villages were interviewed. The majority of respondents (67.9%) use traditional remedies for treatment of these conditions. However, 25.9% of them use a combination of traditional remedies with conventional medicines. The survey revealed that 13 medicinal plants belonging to 11 families were used. Aloe ferox, Prunus persica and Phytolacca heptandra were, however, the most commonly used. Leaves are the most frequently used plant part, often prepared as an infusion. Other non-plant remedies used include disinfectants, antiseptics as well as diesel and petrol. Manual removal of maggots from wounds was also practise and treatment is usually continued until the wound heals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Science and Agriculture, University of Fort Hare, Private Bag x1314, Alice, 5700 South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soyelu", "ForeName": "O T", "Initials": "OT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masika", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "Onderstepoort J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0401107", "ISSNLinking": "0030-2465"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Myiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Infection"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21344789", "10.4102/ojvr.v76i4.23"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
