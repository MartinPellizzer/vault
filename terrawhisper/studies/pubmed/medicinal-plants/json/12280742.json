The study has 2 phases: 1) phase 1 gathered information from the regional population offices on the areas where herbs are grown, and 2) phase 2 sought to obtain data on the preparation and perceived effectiveness of herbal contraceptives. Results indicate that, in most of the Philippine regions, herbal contraceptives had long been used by women in the rural areas, specifically those in the indigenous groups. The 1984 study found that many rural women in the research area preferred the Kamias drink and other herbal concoctions to the pill and other modern contraceptive methods. Among college-educated women, it was found that acceptance of contraceptives was influenced more by their religion rather than by their education. Most of the respondents said they used herbal contraceptives because they were easily obtained and were inexpensive. Generally, they considered herbal contraceptives much safer than other contraceptives methods. Some women who had been using modern family planning methods are now using herbs in delaying pregnancy; this shift is mainly due to the side effects of the modern methods. There is room for a compromise between folk practices and modern science, as in the case of herbal contraceptives."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["S-18232-019-4", "00167861"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INITIATIVES IN POPULATION"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Cultural Background", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Oral Contraceptives", "Philippines", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population Characteristics", "Qualitative Evaluation", "Religion", "Rural Population", "Southeastern Asia", "Use-effectiveness"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12280742", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "01", "Day": "22"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0115-2181", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1986"}}, "Title": "Initiatives in population", "ISOAbbreviation": "Initiatives Popul"}, "ArticleTitle": "Herbal contraceptives: exploring indigenous methods of family planning.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "22", "EndPage": "35", "MedlinePgn": "22, 31-35"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Quijano Nv", "Suffix": "Jr"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Philippines", "MedlineTA": "Initiatives Popul", "NlmUniqueID": "7604208", "ISSNLinking": "0115-2181"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Oral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philippines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Religion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12280742"]}}]}
