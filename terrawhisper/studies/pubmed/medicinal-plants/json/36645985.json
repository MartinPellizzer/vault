This is the first study focused on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant, anti-\u03b1-glucosidase, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-neuroinflammatory activities of the branches and leaves of O. hosiei. Herein, thirty-seven characteristic compounds were identified by UPLC-MS/MS and twelve were detected for the first time in O. hosiei. Twenty-seven phenolics were further quantified and significant differences in phenolic compositions between the branches and leaves of O. hosiei were observed. The ethanol extracts exhibited promising antioxidant, anti-\u03b1-glucosidase, anti-tyrosinase, and anti-neuroinflammatory effects, and the bioactivities significantly correlated with total phenolic content and twelve individual phenolics. Naringin, genistein, vitexin, vitexin-2-O-rhamnoside, syringaresinol and syringaresinol-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside can be considered potential quality markers of O. hosiei. Our results provided solid evidence that the branches and leaves of O. hosiei deserve more attention and exploitation, considering the potential to be developed as functional foods or herbal medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
