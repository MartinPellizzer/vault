Ten water-soluble catecholic isoquinolines were isolated from the medicinal plant Portulaca oleracea, including three new (1-3) and seven known compounds (4-10), along with the known catecholamines 11 and 12 and four other known compounds (13-16). A method of polyamide column chromatography using EtOAc-MeOH as the mobile phase was developed for the isolation of catecholic isoquinolines. Alkaloids 1-12 exhibited anti-inflammatory activities (EC<sub>50</sub> = 18.0-497.7 \u03bcM) through inhibition of NO production in lipopolysaccharide-induced murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Among these compounds, 11, 2, 5, 4, and 8 were more potent than was the positive control, 3,4-dihydroxybenzohydroxamic acid (EC<sub>50</sub> = 82.4 \u03bcM), with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 18.0, 18.1, 35.4, 36.3, and 58.7 \u03bcM, respectively. Additionally, at 100 \u03bcM, compounds 1-12 showed different degrees of \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>-AR) agonist activity in the CHO-K1/GA15 cell line which stably expressed \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-AR as detected by a calcium assay. The EC<sub>50</sub> values of 2 and 10 were 5.1 \u03bcM and 87.9 nM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of
