Cows were fed a common total mixed ration containing corn silage, legume silage, chopped legume hay, and a grain and mineral pellet that was top-dressed with one of three treatments. Treatments consisted of 1) 0 g/d of Mepron 85, 2) 15 g/d of Mepron 85 (11 g of rumen-protected Met), or 3) 30 g/d of Mepron 85 (22 g of rumen-protected Met). Cows were housed in a tie-stall barn, had continuous access to fresh water, and were fed once daily at 0900 h for ad libitum intake. Dry matter intake (DMI), orts, and milk yields were recorded daily, and weekly milk samples were collected for analyses of fat, protein, SCC, and milk urea nitrogen. Blood and milk samples were collected before the beginning of the experiment and during wk 2 and 4 of each 28-d treatment period. Blood was analyzed for serum methionine, lymphocyte proliferation, and phenotypic composition of isolated mononuclear cells. Milk samples were analyzed for phenotypic composition of isolated mononuclear cells. Least square means for DMI, milk yield, milk composition, and phenotypic mononuclear cell composition of blood and milk were not affected by treatment. Proliferative ability of peripheral blood T lymphocytes increased for cows consuming 30 g/d of Mepron 85."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dairy and Animal Science, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802, USA."}], "LastName": "Soder", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Holden", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Milk Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Milk Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10509252", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(99)75429-9", "S0022-0302(99)75429-9"]}}]}
