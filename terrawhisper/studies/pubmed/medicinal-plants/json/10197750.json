The degree of inhibition was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 295 nm associated with uric acid formation. Eighty-eight percent of the plants were found to have inhibitory activity at 100 microg/ml, with 20% having greater than 50% inhibition. Larix laricina exhibited the highest activity with an inhibition of 86.33%. Of the species with the highest activity, Lineweaver-Burk plots showed that inhibition mode was of linear mixed-type. Inhibitory activity of the plants correlated positively with their phenolic content (r = 0.52 P < 0.01) and tannin content (r = 0.59 P < 0.001)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, McGill University, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Qu\u00e9, Canada."}], "LastName": "Owen", "ForeName": "P L", "Initials": "PL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johns", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gout"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10197750", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00119-6", "S0378874198001196"]}}]}
