Organogenic callus were induced on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 5.0\u00a0\u00b5M 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and 2.5\u00a0\u00b5M thidiazuron (TDZ). Adventitious shoot regeneration was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 5.0\u00a0\u00b5M TDZ as it induced 8.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.98 shoots in 85% cultures. The number of shoots and shoot length was significantly enhanced when cultures were subcultured on auxin-cytokinin-containing medium. The highest number of shoots (12.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.10) and shoot length (4.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20\u00a0cm) was recorded on MS medium supplemented with 5.0\u00a0\u00b5M TDZ and 1.5\u00a0\u00b5M indole-3-acetic acid. Regenerated shoots were rooted best on MS medium supplemented with 10.0\u00a0\u00b5M indole-3-butyric acid followed by their transfer to liquid MS filter paper bridge medium. The plants were successfully hardened off in sterile soilrite followed by their establishment in garden soil with 70% survival rate. The plants showed normal morphological characteristics similar to the field grown plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siddique", "ForeName": "Iram", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anis", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aref", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["embryology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20461494", "10.1007/s12010-010-8982-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
