A network pharmacology-based approach is incorporated for validation of traditional claims orbiting around anti-inflammatory properties and directed its future exploration against obesity, ovarian inflammation, ovarian folliculogenesis, and inflammatory breast cancer.", "In a nutshell, the present review encompasses the phytochemistry, pharmacology of this species intending to sensitize the scientific community for future research on this promising plant. Nearly 85 chemical constituents are reported from the plants wherein bark and leaves are enriched with the lupane and oleanane class of triterpene while sesquiterpenes and polyphenolic compounds are predominantly present in the heartwood of the plant. Although phytochemical investigations are being reported since the mid-twentieth century however there has been recent interest in the evaluation of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-viral, etc. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, a systematic phytochemical analysis and pharmacological exploration in close collaboration for establishing the therapeutic potential of the chemical constituents present in P. santalinus is recommended to substantiate the traditional claims for bringing it into the mainstream pharmaceutical and commercial utilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
