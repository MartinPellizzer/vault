The results showed that the components of volatile oil of herbal pair (AA-AR) were different from that of single herb drug in quality and quantity. 70, 69, and 48 essential components in essential oil of herbal pair (AA-AR), AA and AR were determined, accounting for about 85.93%, 88.85% and 93.23% of the total volatile oil, respectively. The volatile active components of the essential oils compounds in number are almost the sum of that of two single herbs, are mainly from herb AA, and the contents of each component from herb AR were relatively high. There are 51 common active constituents shared by herbal pair AA-AR and AA, and 34 common active constituents shared by herbal pair AA-AR and AR. There are 7 new components in the essential oils of herbal pair AA-AR, the relative content of arteannuic acid (2.99%) and p-propenyl-anisole (1.92%) are higher than others."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Technology, Chongqing University ofArts and Science, Chongqing 402168, China. yunhai-xiong@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Yun-hai", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agastache"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21355326"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
