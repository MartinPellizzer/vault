Therefore, the aim of this study was the determination of polonium <sup>210</sup>Po in 48 selected medicinal herb samples from the Polish market. The activity concentrations of <sup>210</sup>Po were measured using alpha spectrometry. The activity concentration of <sup>210</sup>Po was in the range from 0.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 to 28.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup>. The obtained results were compared with corresponding studies conducted worldwide. A higher <sup>210</sup>Po activity concentration was observed in the above-ground part of plants. The obtained results show that the highest <sup>210</sup>Po activity concentration was observed in evergreen plants and winter-hardy plants. Yet even infusions with 2 g of the most contaminated herbs examined were considered to be radiologically safe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Chemistry , University of Gda\u0144sk , Gda\u0144sk , Poland."}], "LastName": "Bory\u0142o", "ForeName": "Alicja", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Chemistry , University of Gda\u0144sk , Gda\u0144sk , Poland."}], "LastName": "Roma\u0144czyk", "ForeName": "Grzegorz", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Chemistry , University of Gda\u0144sk , Gda\u0144sk , Poland."}], "LastName": "Kaczor", "ForeName": "Marcin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Chemistry , University of Gda\u0144sk , Gda\u0144sk , Poland."}], "LastName": "Skwarzec", "ForeName": "Bogdan", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Isotopes Environ Health Stud", "NlmUniqueID": "9602611", "ISSNLinking": "1025-6016"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "DQY03U61EJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Polonium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QJW5366Y3Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Polonium-210"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31062607", "10.1080/10256016.2019.1609960"]}}]}
