To identify the bioactive substances, the methanol extract of <i>P. longifolia</i> was extracted by organic solvents, and consequently, four new 2-oxo-clerodane diterpenes (<b>1-4</b>), a new 4(3 \u2192 2)-<i>abeo</i>-clerodane diterpene (<b>5</b>), together with ten known compounds (<b>6-16</b>) were isolated and identified from the extracts. Of the new compounds, compound <b>2</b> showed a broad spectrum of antifungal activity with moderated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values in a range of 50-100 \u03bcg/mL against tested fungal pathogens. Considering with the known compounds, compound <b>6</b> showed the most potent antifungal activity with an MIC value in the range of 6.3-12.5 \u03bcg/mL. When compound <b>6</b> was evaluated for an <i>in vivo</i> antifungal activity against rice blast, tomato late blight, and pepper anthracnose, compound <b>6</b> reduced the plant disease by at least 60% compared to the untreated control at concentrations of 250 and 500 \u03bcg/mL. Together, our results suggested that the methanol extract of twigs and leaves of <i>P. longifolia</i> and its major compound <b>6</b> could be used as a source for the development of eco-friendly plant protection agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Eco-Friendly New Materials, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon 34114, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea."}], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Minh Van", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Eco-Friendly New Materials, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon 34114, Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jae Woo", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Center of Bioactive Compounds, Vietnam Institute of Industrial Chemistry, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Le Dang", "ForeName": "Quang", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal Medicine Resources Research Center, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Naju 58245, Korea."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Seung Mok", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4379-814X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosystems and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul 02841, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dongho", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6727-4469"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Eco-Friendly New Materials, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon 34114, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Eco-Friendly New Materials, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Daejeon 34114, Korea."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, University of Science and Technology, Daejeon 34113, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Gyung Ja", "Initials": "GJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes, Clerodane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes, Clerodane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyalthia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34469148", "10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02200"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
