The obtained MDMIP was characterized and recognized, and then its adsorbing performance was studied. Based on the results, the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub>-MDMIP indicated selective recognition towards p-CA and FA with large adsorption capacity. The optimization of MDMIP-SS-MSPME conditions (pH, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@SiO<sub>2</sub>-MDMIP mass, NaCl concentration, number of cycle, and elution volume) were conducted using the central composite design (CCD). Under the optimum conditions, an effectual and a convenient method was established to determine p-CA and FA in pomegranate, grapes, and orange samples based on SS-MSPME coupling with high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). Our developed method showed the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for p-CA and 0.07\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> for FA. The method also indicated good linearity with R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0>\u00a00.99 and good recoveries of 85.12-94.96% with RSDs\u00a0\u2264\u00a05.58% spiked at three various concentration levels in pomegranate, grapes, and orange samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
