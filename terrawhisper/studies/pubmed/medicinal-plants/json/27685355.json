Some of its chemotypes developed by CSIR, India includes NMITLI-101, NMITLI-118, NMITLI-128. In this study the investigators have attempted development of a phytosomal complex of NMITLI118RT\u2009+\u2009(standardized ethanolic extract of a new chemotype of W. somnifera Dunal.), its pharmaceutical characterization and evaluation of its neuro-protective potential against experimenal stroke in rats in continuation with their previous work in this area. The phytosomal complex (NIMPLC) was prepared by following a cohesive optimization design and was characterized on the basis of solubility, dissolution profile, FT-IR, DSC-TGA analysis, zeta potential, physical stability, forced degradation and photolytic degradation. Results were suggestive of a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation. NIMPLC was taken up further for biological evaluation using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats. It could be demonstrated that the beneficial effects of NMITLI118RT\u2009+\u2009could be augmented by NIMPLC in 1\u2009h pre and 6\u2009h post treatment as was evident from reduction in MDA levels, increment in GSH levels, reduction in neurological deficit (ND) scores and reduction in infarct size. The study could successfully demonstrate the beneficial effects of NIMPLC in brain function restoration following stroke."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Hafsa", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Arya", "ForeName": "Abhishek", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "Satish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Samuel", "ForeName": "Sheeba Saji", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Pharmacokinetics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Sandeep Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Pharmacokinetics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Valicherla", "ForeName": "Guru Raghavendra", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology , CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants , Lucknow , India , and."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Electron Microscopy Unit, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Mitra", "ForeName": "Kalyan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Division of Pharmacokinetics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Gayen", "ForeName": "Jiaur R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Pharmacy , Banasthali Vidyapeeth , Banasthali , India."}], "LastName": "Paliwal", "ForeName": "Sarwesh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Division of Pharmaceutics , CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute , Lucknow , India."}], "LastName": "Dwivedi", "ForeName": "Anil Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "9417471", "ISSNLinking": "1071-7544"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V038D626IF", "NameOfSubstance": "Ashwagandha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stroke"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27685355", "10.1080/10717544.2016.1212950"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
