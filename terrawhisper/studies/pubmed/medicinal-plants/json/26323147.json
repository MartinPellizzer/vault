The Waters sunfire C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m) was used and the detection wavelength was 330 nm . The column temperature was 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phases were acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid (B) eluting in a gradient program at a flow rate of 1.0 mL \u00b7 min(-1). The chromatographic fingerprint similarity evaluation system for tradition Chinese medicine(2012) was used for analysis. C. nudiflora from different samples were of high similarity in fingerprint and the separation of ten components was good. There was an obvious difference between other samples and C. nudiflora leaves. In quantitative analysis, the ten components showed good regression(R2 > 0 999 0) with linear ranges, and their recoveries were in the range of 96.0%-105.0%. The established qualitative and quantitative methods are highly specific, simple and accurate, which can be used for the identification and quality control of C. nudiflora."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Dong-kun", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei-kang", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-cheng", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Chen-xuan", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yue-hua", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Callicarpa"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26323147"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
