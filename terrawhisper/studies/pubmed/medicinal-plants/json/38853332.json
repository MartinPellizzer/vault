Valued for its culinary and medicinal properties, it is extensively cultivated, covering approximately 5,973 hm2 in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The edible tubers of this plant are reported to possess antibacterial and antioxidant effects (Luo et al., 2023; Shu et al., 2020). In July 2021, a Niudali plantation in Yulin, Guangxi, China (22\u00b064'N; 110\u00b029'E) exhibited leaf spot symptoms, with an incidence rate exceeding 40% across a 46,690 m2 area. Initially, small circular, pale yellow spots appeared on the leaves, which subsequently evolved into dark brown lesions surrounded by yellow halos, ultimately leading to foliage wilting. Leaves exhibiting typical symptoms were collected for pathogen investigation. The leaves were thoroughly washed with sterile water and small tissue fragments (5\u00d75 mm) were excised from the lesion periphery. These fragments were surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol and 1% NaClO, rinsed three times with sterile water, and subsequently cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28 \u00b0C in darkness for 7 days. Through single-spore isolation, seven isolates with similar morphological traits were obtained. After 7 days of incubation on PDA at 28 \u00b0C in dark, the colonies exhibited a white to grey coloration on the upper surface with abundant aerial hyphae, while the underside appeared dark black. The conidia, cylindrical or obclavate in shape, were straight, pale brown, and measured 30.1-128.9 \u03bcm \u00d7 4.8-15.0 \u03bcm (n=50). The morphological characteristics matched those of Corynespora sp.(Wang et al. 2021). For molecular identification, the isolate N5-2 underwent DNA sequence analysis using genomic DNA and primers ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-688F/EF1-1251R. The sequences (ITS: OP550425; TEF1-\u03b1: OQ117118) were deposited in GenBank, exhibiting 98% identity to C. cassiicola (OP981637) for TEF1-\u03b1 and 99% homology to C. cassiicola (OP957070) for ITS. Based on the concatenated ITS and TEF1-\u03b1, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses using MEGA7.0 clustered the isolate with C. cassiicola. Consequently, the fungus was identified as C. cassiicola based on its morphological and molecular features. In the pathogenicity test on 1-year-old Nanhaia speciosa seedlings, leaves were gently scratched and inoculated with mycelial plugs (5 mm). Control seedlings received PDA plugs. Five leaves per plant and five plants per treatment were selected for assessment. All seedling were maintained in a greenhouse (12/12h light/dark cycle, 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, 90% humidity). After a 7-day incubation period, all leaves subjected to fungal inoculation exhibited symptoms consistent with those observed in the field, while control plants remained symptom-free. The fungus was successfully reisolated from the infected leaves in three successive trials, fulfilling Koch's postulates. While C. cassiicola is well-documented for inducing leaf spots on various plant species, including Jasminum nudiflorum, Strobilanthes cusia, Acanthus ilicifolius, Syringa species (Hu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021), this study represents the first report of C. cassiicola causing leaf spots on Nanhaia speciosa in China. The identification of this pathogen in Nanhaia speciosa has significant implications for future epidemiological investigations and serves as a valuable reference for controlling leaf spot disease in Nanhaia speciosa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1303, , China, 537000; jiemingpan@163.com."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin, China; 1005871997@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Xiaoshan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin Normal University, China; 2930741253@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "YuanYuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin Normal University, College of Biology and Pharmacy, Yulin, Guangxi, China; 3027684019@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "PingPing", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin, China, 537000; 2575384786@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin, China; 1746392548@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yulin, China; 1350576940@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ya", "ForeName": "Caina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Education East Road No. 3303, Yulin City, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.Yulin, China, 570228; liuqin@ylu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38853332", "10.1094/PDIS-03-24-0562-PDN"]}}]}
