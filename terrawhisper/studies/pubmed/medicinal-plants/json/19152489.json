Plants collectively produce a huge array of chemicals, far more than are produced by most other organisms; hence, metabolomics is of great importance in plant biology. Although substantial improvements have been made in the field of metabolomics, the uniform annotation of metabolite signals in databases and informatics through international standardization efforts remains a challenge, as does the development of new fields such as fluxome analysis and single cell analysis. The principle of transcript and metabolite cooccurrence, particularly transcriptome coexpression network analysis, is a powerful tool for decoding the function of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. This strategy can now be used for the identification of genes involved in specific pathways in crops and medicinal plants. Metabolomics has gained importance in biotechnology applications, as exemplified by quantitative loci analysis, prediction of food quality, and evaluation of genetically modified crops. Systems biology driven by metabolome data will aid in deciphering the secrets of plant cell systems and their application to biotechnology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RIKEN Plant Science Center, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Japan. ksaito@psc.riken.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "Kazuki", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "Fumio", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Annu Rev Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101140127", "ISSNLinking": "1543-5008"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Systems Biology"}], "NumberOfReferences": "232"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19152489", "10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092035", "10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
