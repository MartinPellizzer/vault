Many countries implemented specific legislation scheduling classes of substances defined on the basis of their chemical structure to reduce supply. We describe the identification and analytical characterization within the EU project ADEBAR plus of 1-(cyclobutylmethyl)-N-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)-1H-indole-3-carboxamide which resulted in the formal notification through the Early Warning System of the European Monitoring Centre for Drug and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). This is the first identification of this new SCRA worldwide and the analytical data was distributed (inter-)nationally right after identification in 2019. First, the substance was isolated from the herbal material using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structure elucidation and analytical characterization were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-solid state infrared spectroscopy (GC-sIR), liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-qToF-MS), Raman spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The new compound contains a cyclobutyl methyl group as a side chain and has not been described in any patent to our knowledge. Based on the semisystematic nomenclature of SCRAs, we propose Cumyl-CBMICA as a short name for the compound."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forensic Medicine, Forensic Toxicology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Halter", "ForeName": "Sebastian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7772-2111"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forensic Medicine, Forensic Toxicology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Bureau of Criminal Investigation Schleswig-Holstein, Forensic Science Institute, Kiel, Germany."}], "LastName": "Pulver", "ForeName": "Benedikt", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forensic Medicine, Forensic Toxicology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Wilde", "ForeName": "Maurice", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2954-7539"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forensic Medicine, Forensic Toxicology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hermann Staudinger Graduate School, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Haschimi", "ForeName": "Belal", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Bureau of Criminal Investigation Schleswig-Holstein, Forensic Science Institute, Kiel, Germany."}], "LastName": "Westphal", "ForeName": "Folker", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Criminal Police Office, Forensic Science Institute, Wiesbaden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Riedel", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Criminal Police Office, Forensic Science Institute, Wiesbaden, Germany."}], "LastName": "P\u00fctz", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Criminal Police Office, Forensic Science Institute, Wiesbaden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sch\u00f6nberger", "ForeName": "Torsten", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal Criminal Police Office, Forensic Science Institute, Wiesbaden, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stoll", "ForeName": "Stefanie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Bureau of Criminal Investigation Bavaria, Forensic Science Institute, Munich, Germany."}], "LastName": "Sch\u00e4per", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1883-2804"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Forensic Medicine, Forensic Toxicology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Auw\u00e4rter", "ForeName": "Volker", "Initials": "V"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "IZ25-5793-2019-33", "Agency": "Internal Security Fund of the European Union", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Test Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "101483449", "ISSNLinking": "1942-7603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Illicit Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Illicit Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis, Raman"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "de Luca MA, Fattore L.
