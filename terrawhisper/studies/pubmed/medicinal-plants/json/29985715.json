It is characterized by increased bone fragility and loss of bone matter due to the action of osteoclast cells, which are associated with modified hormone levels and factors such as aging. Bisphosphonates are the primary treatment for osteoporosis. Apart from bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, calcitonin treatment, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and strontium ranelate (SR) are some of the other treatments available for osteoporosis. However, these treatments have some side effects, such as oily skin, fluid retention, nausea, long-term toxicity, and even prostate cancer in males, and thus natural therapies that incur fewer side effects are sought. Phytochemicals, antioxidants, and other plant-based bioactives are important in the human diet. They are abundant in fruits and help against various chronic diseases, including bone disorders. Other providers of these important compounds are the medicinal plant parts. In this article, we highlight the various species of plants and herbs that are useful for the treatment of osteoporosis. The prospect of using these plant-based bioactives in amelioration of osteoporosis as an alternative to hormonal and synthetic drug-based therapy is also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies , Haryana , India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Twinkle", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies , Haryana , India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Accendere, CL Educate , New Delhi , India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Nilanjan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies , Haryana , India."}], "LastName": "Imran", "ForeName": "Sabiha", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Diet Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "101249830", "ISSNLinking": "1939-0211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Synthetic Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiophenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04NQ160FRU", "NameOfSubstance": "strontium ranelate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density Conservation Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Synthetic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Thiophenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29985715", "10.1080/19390211.2018.1472715"]}}]}
