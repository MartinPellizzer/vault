Lilium longiflorum had the longest growth period,246 days,among these six lily varieties,while others were about 170 days. The leaves of L.longiflorum,self-selected variety,L. lancifolium and L. dauricum had higher chlorophyll content. No obvious difference was found in net photosynthetic rate,stomatal conductance,transpiration rate and intercellular CO2 concentration among all varieties. The self-selected variety had the highest theoretical and actual yield,2 543. 03,1 608. 65 kg per Mu(1 Mu\u2248666. 7 m2),respectively,but contents of polysaccharides and flavones in bulbs were lower. All of these six lily varieties can sowing,seedling emergence,growth,flowering,mature harvest in Hunan province. L. dauricum and L. lancifolium would be provided for edible lily. L. brownie and the self-selected variety are highly susceptible varieties. L. dauricum and L. lancifolium are suitable to plant widely in disease-prone regions,due to their strong resistance. L. brownie and L. lancifolium are preferred varieties for medicinal and food using for their good quality and higher contents of polysaccharides and flavones. L. davidii had lower theoretical and actual yield,so planting extension of it should be taken into account."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jia-Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qi", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Si-Wen", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yan-Ning", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Institute of Agro-Environment and Ecology Changsha 410125,China Center for Research & Development of Medicinal Plants,Hunan Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changsha 410125,China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Yan-Jiao", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lilium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872651", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190829.103"]}}]}
