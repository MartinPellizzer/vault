Gas chromatography/mass spectrometer profiling and liquid chromatographic/mass spectral investigation confirmed and quantified the presence of canavanine, GABA and arginine in the herbal preparation used in this study. In vitro study demonstrated a concentration dependent effect of Sutherlandia on several tumor cell lines, with 50% inhibition (IC50) of proliferation of MCF7, MDA-MB-468, Jurkat and HL60 cells at 1/250, 1/200, 1/150 and 1/200 dilutions, respectively. Sutherlandia treatment did not induce HL60 differentiation along the macrophage/monocyte or granulocyte lineage. It demonstrated antioxidant activity in reducing free radical cations with an estimated activity of 0.5 microl of Sutherlandia extract equivalent to that of 10 microM of Trolox. However, it did not significantly suppress lipopolysaccharide stimulated nitric oxide production by murine macrophage/monocyte RAW 264.7 cells, nor did it significantly inhibit IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression in RAW 264.7 cells. In conclusion, Sutherlandia ethanolic extract showed a concentration dependent antiproliferative effect on several human tumor cell lines but did not show significant antioxidant effects. Further studies are needed to explore the activities of this multipurpose South African herbal preparation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Pathology and Pediatrics, Center for Complementary Medicine Research, BC's Research Institute for Children's and Women's Health, University of British Columbia, 4480 Oak Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V5Z 4H4. jtai@interchange.ubc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tai", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheung", "ForeName": "Susan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Edwin", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hasman", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Galega"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jurkat Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15182898", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.02.028", "S0378874104001175"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
