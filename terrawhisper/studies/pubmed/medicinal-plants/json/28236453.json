L. Cabrera (Compositae), which has been used as an ethnic medicine for treating cough, asthma and wounds in southwestern China. Among them, six compounds are previously undescribed ent-kaurenoic acids, and a known compound, 7\u03b2,15\u03b2-dihydroxy-ent-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid, was obtained for the first time from nature. Based on its traditional effects in Chinese folk, the potential anti-inflammatory activities of its methanol extracts (ME) and isolated diterpenes were evaluated by the tests of the xylene-induced ear swelling in mice, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse macrophage cellular RAW 264.7 and inhibition assay of neutrophil elastase, respectively, resulting that ME performed obvious effect against mouse ear swelling with a dose-dependent inhibition in\u00a0vivo, and nine compounds showed significant inhibition of NO production in\u00a0vitro, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.042 to 8.22\u00a0\u03bcM, while they also exhibited inhibition of neutrophil elastase at 100\u00a0\u03bcM in\u00a0vitro, speculating that those diterpenes may be the active substances correlated with their traditional efficacy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
