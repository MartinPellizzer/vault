Acute gastric ulcers were induced by gipsing the rats for 22 hr preceded by 24 hr starvation to obtain the maximum stress. The free HCl, total HCl and total acidity were also measured. The total lipid (TLP), 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 g/kg, reduced the ulcer index by 25-41.8% and 50-58% when given daily for 5 and 10 days, respectively. The saponifiable fraction (SP), 0.85, 2.0 and 4.0 g/kg, given for 10 days reduced the ulcer index by 41.8-50%, while the nonsaponifiable (NSP), 0.075, 0.150 and 0.50 g/kg, for 10 days reduced it by 50-83.5%. The 70% ethanol extract of the defatted residue showed no antiulcer effect. Analysis of the gastric juice showed a significant decrease in free HCl (P less than 0.001) induced by TLP; the total HCl and total acidity were reduced only at 5 g/kg. The results revealed the antiulcer effect of the lipid components of M. azedarach fruits which is mainly due to the phytosterol fraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hanifa Moursi", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Khatib", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restraint, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6543233", "10.1254/jjp.36.527"]}}]}
