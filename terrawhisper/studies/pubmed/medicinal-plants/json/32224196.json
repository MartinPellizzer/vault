This data supports the conservation of local traditional ecological knowledge and will facilitate future drug discovery research.", "Our study aimed to conserve culturally and scientifically-valuable medical knowledge of 16 plant species traditionally used in the Greater Mpigi region in Uganda, namely Albizia coriaria, Cassine buchananii, Combretum molle, Erythrina abyssinica, Ficus saussureana, Harungana madagascariensis, Leucas calostachys, Microgramma lycopodioides, Morella kandtiana, Plectranthus hadiensis, Securidaca longipedunculata, Sesamum calycinum subsp. angustifolium, Solanum aculeastrum, Toddalia asiatica, Warburgia ugandensis and Zanthoxylum chalybeum. An additional objective of the study was an ethnological investigation of the socio-cultural background and medical understanding of diseases treated by traditional healers in the study area.", "A pilot survey in the study area revealed that 16 plant species were frequently used in treatment of a variety of medical disorders. In order to obtain more complete information, we conducted a broader ethnobotanical survey using structured interviews with 39 traditional healers from 29 villages, specifically asking about the traditional uses of these 16 medicinal species.", "Results of the survey confirmed a high level of traditional use of these species in the Greater Mpigi region. In addition, various other traditional uses and methods of preparation were recorded, most of them for the first time. In total, 75 different medical disorders treated with the plants were documented.", "Conservation of traditional knowledge for future generations is vital, as loss has already been recorded due to multiple causes. The need for novel and more effective drugs derived from natural products is more important than ever, making future studies on herbal remedies both justified and urgently required. The traditional healers surveyed in this project also have expectations of the research - they would like to be updated about any resulting studies into the pharmacological efficacy of medicinal plants so that the research findings can inform their confidence in each herbal remedy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
