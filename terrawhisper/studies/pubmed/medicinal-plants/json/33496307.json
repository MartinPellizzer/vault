However, the effects of post-harvest treatment on the structure-activity relationships of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in leaves of I. polycarpa are still unknown. In the current study, we compared the contents of unstable compounds in leaves with four drying methods, namely sun-drying, freeze-drying, shade-drying, and oven-drying. We found that the four hydroxycinnamic acid derivative isomers of leaves were significantly affected after drying processing with four different drying methods. Consequently, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the variation of these compounds during the drying processes have been well elucidated: UV lighting induced the isomerization of 1-[(6'-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl]-oxy-2-phenol (1) and 1-[(4'-O-(E)-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl]-oxy-2-phenol (3) into 1-[(6'-O-(Z)-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl]-oxy-2-phenol (2) and 1-[(4'-O-(Z)-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl]-oxy-2-phenol (4). Also, heat (exceeding 20 \u00b0C) led to the rearrangement of the (E/Z)-p-coumaric acid moiety of compounds 3 and 4, of which the 4-O-acylglucoses changed into the 6-O-acylglucoses to generate compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Interestingly, the hepatocyte-free fatty acid accumulation in OA-induced steatosis-conditioned HepG2 cells decreased by 65.00%, 10.69%, and 47.00%, respectively, following treatment with compounds 2, 3 and 4, and compound 1 presented no lipid-lowering activity. In addition, the bioactivities of compounds 2 and 4 were substantially enhanced by 58.42% and 25.33% with the sun-drying method compared to the freeze-dying methods. Our study suggests that sun-drying processing is the best method among the four drying processing methods of I. polycarpa Maxim. leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0828-1321"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China and Key Laboratory of Bio-resources and Eco-environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. tangl666@126.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bio-resources and Eco-environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. tangl666@126.com."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Jianfei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jingrui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi 563000, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Shiji", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions & Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China. liyanmei518@hotmail.com and Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province & Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yanmei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bio-resources and Eco-environment of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China. tangl666@126.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33496307", "10.1039/d0fo01813a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
