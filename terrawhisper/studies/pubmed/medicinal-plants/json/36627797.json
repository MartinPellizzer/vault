Yam is rich in fiber and antioxidants, and can significantly reduce blood sugar. Therefore, it is also known as a medicinal crop with high medicinal value in China (Cao et al. 2021). In October 2021, leaf spots were observed on the seven month old yam leaves of a commercial yam field in Nanjing city, Jiangsu Province, China. The field had a disease severity of approximately 25% and an incidence of 30%, and the infected plants displayed poor development. Symptoms in the leaves included irregular yellow to brown spots of different sizes, and lesion spots later turned dark brown, resulting in necrotic leaves (Fig. S1A). Four symptomatic leaves collected from 3 yam plants were rinsed with water, cut into 2-mm small square leaf pieces and were surface-sterilized in 70% ethanol and 2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. The sterilized leaf tissues were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing ampicillin and rifampicin, and then were incubated at 25\u00b0C in the dark for 3-5 days. Three isolates (NAU-1, NAU-2, and NAU-3) were obtained from a total of four leaf samples by purifying of single-spore culture. Nine agar plugs (6\u00d76 mm2) were transferred into 8 mL of PDA in a 70 mm plate at 25\u00b0C to observe colony morphology. The three isolates had identical morphological features. For the representative isolate NAU-1, colonies were white and fluffy in appearance during initial 4 days, and became gray-brown with the onset of sporulation after 5 days (Fig. S1B). Microscopic observation showed that mycelia were smooth, branched, and septate (Fig. S1C) and conidia were single-celled, black, spherical to subspherical, measuring 10.7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5m \u00d7 12.5 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5m in diameter (n=50) (Fig. S1D). Morphological features suggested that these isolates possessed the same characteristics. For accurate identification, the genomic DNA was extracted from each isolate using Fungi Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (D2300; Solarbio, Beijing, China). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2) gene, and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (Tef-1\u03b1) gene, were amplified using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), Bt2a/Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and EF1/EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998), respectively. These sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS: ON394529, OP735574, and OP735562; TUB2: ON427830, OP756526, and OP756528; Tef-1\u03b1: ON427831, OP756525, and OP756527 for NAU-1, NAU-2, and NAU-3, respectively). The ITS, TUB2, and Tef-1\u03b1 sequences of three isolates showed high similarity (>98.5%) to the corresponding sequences (MT732051.1, KY019554.1, and KY019413.1) of Nigrospora oryzae in GenBank. Further phylogenetic analysis showed that the three isolates clustered with N. oryzae (Fig. S2). Therefore, based on morphological and molecular evidence, the three isolates were identified as N. oryzae. N. oryzae has been reported to cause leaf spot on cotton and ginger in China (Zhang et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2022). Furthermore, the pathogenicity of isolated N. oryzae was tested on healthy, potted 1-year-old yam plants. The 6-mm agar plugs-containing mycelia from 4-day-old PDA cultures and agar blocks (control) were used to inoculate sixteen wounded yam leaves, followed by maintaining in a growth chamber under 16 h day at 25\u00b0C and 8 h night at 20\u00b0C. After six days post inoculation, all the inoculated yam leaves exhibited similar symptoms observed in the field, whereas the uninoculated leaves remained symptomless (Fig. S1E). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. N. oryzae was reisolated from the infected plants and confirmed to be the same pathogen by using morphological and molecular methods. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. oryzae causing leaf spot disease of yams in China. Identification of this pathogen would assist in developing strategies to efficiently control the spread of the disease on Chinese yams."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Agricultural University, 70578, College of Plant Protection, China Jiangsu Nanjing, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, 210095; 2018202009@njau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xinyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Agricultural University, 70578, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; 2021102007@stu.njau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Agricultural University, 70578, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; 2021802156@stu.njau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Kangxu", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Agricultural University, 70578, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; 2022802232@stu.njau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Linghui", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, No.1 Weigang Road, Nanjing, Jiang, China, 210095; shendanyu@njau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Danyu", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection, Rd 1.
