(hemp) is a medicinal plant producing various cannabinoids. Its consumption is legalized for medical use due to the alleged positive health effects of these cannabinoids. To satisfy the demand, C.\u00a0sativa plants are propagated in contained growth chambers. During indoor propagation, pesticides usually are used to ensure efficient production. However, pesticide registration and safe application in C.\u00a0sativa has not been investigated in detail.", "With this study the metabolic degradation of pesticides in recently established C.\u00a0sativa callus cultures was examined. Tebuconazole, metalaxyl-M fenhexamid, flurtamone and spirodiclofen were applied at 10\u00a0\u03bcm for 21\u2009days. Results were compared with metabolism data obtained from Brassica napus L., Glycine max (L.) Merr., Zea mays L. and Tritium aestivum L. callus cultures as well as in metabolism guideline studies. The successfully established C.\u00a0sativa callus cultures were able to degrade pesticides by oxidation, demethylation, and cleavage of ester bonds in phase I, as well as glycosylation and conjugation with malonic acid in phase II and III. Initial metabolites were detected after Day (D)7 and were traced at D21.", "The resulting pathways demonstrate the same main degradation strategies as crop plants. Because metabolites could be the main residue, the exposure of consumers to these residues will be of high importance. We present here an in vitro assay for a first estimation of pesticide metabolism in C.\u00a0sativa. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
