The correlation between subclinical hypothyroidism and some of cardiovascular disease risk factors such as serum lipids, homocysteine levels and also insulin resistance index is not well established and the current study was conducted to clarify this issue.", "Seventy four patients with mild elevation in levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) along with normal levels of T3 and T4 were selected as patients group and 74 age and sex matched individuals were selected as healthy control group. Serum insulin, triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and homocysteine levels were measured. Obtained data compared between groups with independent sample t-test. For evaluation of the correlation between mentioned parameters Pearson correlation coefficient method was used.", "Serum levels of LDL-C and total cholesterol significantly increased in SCH group compared to healthy control group.
