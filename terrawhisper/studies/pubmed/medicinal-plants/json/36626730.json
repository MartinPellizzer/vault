A total of 1573 differential expression genes were identified among Bs916, \u0394srf, and \u0394srf\u00a0+\u00a0SRF and grouped into eight categories based on their expression profiles. RT-qPCR analysis of 30 candidate genes showed high consistency with those of transcriptome. Additionally, the expression of eight candidate genes regulated by surfactin in a dose-dependent manner was revealed by lacZ fusion. Based on the above evidence, we proposed that surfactin can act as an extracellular signal for monitoring biofilm formation in Bs916 by directly regulating the expression of AbrB, DegS-degU, and SinI-SinR, and indirectly regulating the phosphorylation of ComA and Spo0A.", "The biofilm of \u0394srf was unable to restore significantly by surfactin addition, combined inclusion of surfactin (SRF), exopolysaccharide (EPS), and \u03b3-poly-dl-glutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA), results in significant restoration of \u0394srf biofilm formation, thereby a preliminary model was presented about the molecular mechanism by which the signaling molecule surfactin regulates Bs916 multicellular behavior."], "CopyrightInformation": "The Author(s) 2022.
