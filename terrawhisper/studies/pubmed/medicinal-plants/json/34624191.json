Among them, the lead compound <b>8b</b> with remarkable CDK2/4/6 and HDAC6 inhibitory activity of IC<sub>50</sub> = 60.9 \u00b1 2.9, 276 \u00b1 22.3, 27.2 \u00b1 4.2, and 128.6 \u00b1 0.4 nM, respectively, can efficiently induce apoptosis and S-phase arrest in several cancer cell lines. In particular, compound <b>8b</b> can prevent the proliferation of a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line (A549) through the Mcl-1/XIAP/PARP axis, in agreement with the unique modes of action of the combined agents of HDAC inhibitors and CDK inhibitors. In an A549 xerograph model, compound <b>8b</b> showed significant antitumor efficacy correlated with its dual inhibition. Our data demonstrated that compound <b>8b</b> as a single agent could be a promising drug candidate for cancer therapy in combination with CDK and HDAC inhibitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
