SM, as a potent vesicating agent, contributes to the destruction of skin in dermis and epidermis layers. The progression of the lesion depends on the concentration of SM and the duration of exposure. Body responses start with pruritus, erythema, edema and xerosis, which lead to the accumulation of immune cells in the target sites and recruitment of mast cells and paracrine-mediated activity. Pro-inflammatory effectors are accumulated in the epidermis, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands resulting in the destruction of the basement membrane beneath the epidermis. There is still no satisfactory countermeasure against SM-induced lesions in clinical therapy, and the symptomatic or supportive treatments are routine management approaches.", "The current review highlights the recent progression of herbal medicines application in SM-induced injuries through the illustrative examples and also demonstrates their efficacies, properties and mechanism of actions as therapeutic agents.", "Phytochemicals and herbal extracts with anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have been recently shown to hold therapeutic promise against the SM-induced cutaneous complications.
