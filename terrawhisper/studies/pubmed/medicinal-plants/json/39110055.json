Common viruses include e.g., Influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis viruses, and recently COVID-19. Many viral diseases are still incurable by conventional antiviral drugs. Moreover, the emergence of resistant viral strains has reinforced the search for other alternatives. In ancient times, herbal therapy was commonly used where medicinal formulations were created from various plants. In recent times, in vitro, in vivo, animal studies, and clinical trials have revealed the antiviral properties of these plants, sparking hope for the treatment of serious viral diseases. The present review aims to summarize studies that focus on medicinal plants available in Egypt with antiviral properties.", "The articles published in English between 1988 and 2022 and available in PubMed and Scopus databases with the relevant keywords were included.", "Thirty-two plants in Egypt have met the criteria and possess in vitro or in vivo antiviral activity via different mechanisms. Only five of them; Camellia sinensis, Marine algae, Zizyphus spina-christi L., Trachyspermum Ammi, and Aloe Vera have been proven to be effective in vivo. For COVID-19, thirteen plants have shown efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 via different mechanisms including Camellia sinensis, Cinnamomum Verum, Punica granatum, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Marine algae, Phlomis aurea oil, Solanum nigrum, Trachyspermum Ammi, Arum palaestinum, Aloe Vera, and Cyperus rotundus.", "This review summarizes the current scientific evidence on 32 medicinal plant species cultivated in Egypt that have demonstrated antiviral properties against various DNA and RNA viruses through in vitro and in vivo studies, highlighting their potential as prospective sources for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Further clinical research is still warranted to validate the effectiveness and safety of these plants as complementary treatment options for viral infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elkhouly", "ForeName": "Abdallah M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baldam", "ForeName": "Maram Y", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Touny", "ForeName": "Shaimaa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Almeanawy", "ForeName": "Amany S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abohalawa", "ForeName": "Mohamed N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamed", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mansour", "ForeName": "Fotouh R", "Initials": "FR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39110055", "AT10881"]}}]}
