Pharmacological tests conducted include those investigating antimicrobial, antidiarrhoeal, antimalarial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and acaricidal properties. Promising activity was shown in a number of assays. Toxicological effects have also been reported from this species. However, it is recommended to conduct a detailed toxicological study, including genotoxicity, as this has not yet been evaluated. Compound(s) with antimalarial, anticancer and acaricidal properties have been isolated from P. viridiflorum.", "The collective pharmacological and phytochemical properties of P. viridiflorum gives credence to the use of this plant species against various diseases in ATM, thus steering significant interest towards in vivo studies and further research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
