The search for a cure is still continuing since many of the synthetic drugs were inefficient in completely treating anxiety, yet caused some dangerous side effects until many of the drugs were withdrawn from the market. One promising source of new anxiolytics could be herbal medicines. The challenge is to screen plant extracts. Rodent models can be used for this purpose but are expensive. Moreover, rodent tests are costly and consume relatively large quantities of sample. For this reason, alternative animal models may be useful. Zebrafish larvae have many advantages for screening natural products. The main advantage is that they can be produced cheaply and in large numbers. Several studies have shown that the zebrafish is a good model for studying drugs that affect anxiety. This review focuses on the use of animal models, including zebrafish larvae, for studying anxiety and screening for herbal medicines that modulate anxiety. Finally, future prospects of the zebrafish larva as an alternative model in this field are also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Animal Sciences and Health, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Institute of Biology Leiden , Leiden, Netherlands ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Plant Sciences and Natural Products, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Institute of Biology Leiden , Leiden, Netherlands ."}], "LastName": "Muniandy", "ForeName": "Yuvendran", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Zebrafish", "NlmUniqueID": "101225070", "ISSNLinking": "1545-8547"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Zebrafish"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29851363", "10.1089/zeb.2018.1562"]}}]}
