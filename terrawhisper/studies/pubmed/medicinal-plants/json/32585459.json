According to the ANOVA, triple interaction of treatments were significant on morphological and phytochmical traits, however, the main effect of treatments only affected physiological attributes. Application of salicylic acid differentially influenced the effects of various concentrations of C60 fullerene on growth traits of both genotypes. In Pharmasaat, foliar application of salicylic acid increased growth traits of plants exposed to C60 fullerene at all concentrations, however, it improved the growth of Jelitto at higher levels of fullerene. The maximum increase of flower\u00a0+\u00a0leaf dry weight was recorded at 1000\u00a0mg/L C60 fullerene in combination with salicylic acid compared to control for Jelitto. In Pharmasaat, the parthenolide content significantly increased following increase of C60 fullerene up to 250\u00a0mg/L with salicylic acid, but a rapid decrease followed at 500-1000\u00a0mg/L. SEM images showed a wider deposition (many spheres with different sizes) of C60 fullerene on leaf tissue of Pharmasaat exposed to high concentration, involving changes in trichome density and tissue rupture. The essential oil content was not significantly increased upon experimental treatments compared to control. Based on hierarchical cluster analysis, C60 fullerene and salicylic acid treatments caused to a co-induction of ion leakage, chlorophyll a, essential oil and parthenoloide in Pharmasaat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
