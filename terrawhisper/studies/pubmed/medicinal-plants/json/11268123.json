In week 3 of culture with insulin, the fat cells exhibited more numerous and larger intracytoplasmic lipid droplets (i.e. 30-40 microm(2)). When Garcinia extract and insulin were added simultaneously, the accumulation of lipid droplets was inhibited and the peak droplet area shifted to become smaller (10-20 microm(2)). The activities of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, a marker of adipose differentiation, were not significantly inhibited by the Garcinia extract. These findings suggest that the Garcinia extract inhibits lipid droplet accumulation in fat cells without affecting adipose conversion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Nagoya Bunri College, 2-1 Sasazuka-cho, Nishi-ku, Nagoya 451-0077, Japan. hsgwn@nagoya-bunri.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Adipocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11268123", "10.1002/ptr.689", "10.1002/ptr.689"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
