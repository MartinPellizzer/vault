This paper exploits this technique to identify the alkaloids in corydalis yanhusuo, an important antalgic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The mass spectral fragmentation behavior of one tertiary alkaloid and two quaternary alkaloids was studied in detail. Low-abundance product ions of tertiary and quaternary alkaloids were investigated and compared between each other. Sixteen alkaloids were screened out by using a systematic screening method developed in our laboratory; structures of eight therein were identified by characteristic UV absorption spectrum and positive ion mode of Q-TOF-MS/MS; and two of them were discovered for the first time in corydalis yanhusuo to our knowledge. This research demonstrates the potential of UPLC-Q-TOF-MS in structural characterization and identification of components in traditional Chinese herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Separation Science for Analytical Chemistry, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian 116023, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Yuansheng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Jiatao", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Xingya", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiuli", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xinmiao", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Talanta", "NlmUniqueID": "2984816R", "ISSNLinking": "0039-9140"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19203617", "10.1016/j.talanta.2008.12.002", "S0039-9140(08)00871-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
