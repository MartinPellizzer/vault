Aim of the study was to answer the question whether mitochondria of diabetic myocardium are more sensitive to hypoxia than in normal condition, and whether antioxidative protection by EGb is effective. Further we compared the ultrastructural reactions of mitochondria of different intracellular locations. Voluminal parameters of mitochondria indicated a moderate swelling after diabetes and a further slight swelling after additional hypoxia, which was slightly reduced after EGb pretreatment. Decrease of volume density of mitochondrial cristae was less expressed after diabetes and much stronger after additional hypoxia; slight protection by EGb was only visible after diabetes. Degenerative intramitochondrial areas increased significantly after diabetes and after hypoxia; EGb was protective only after additional hypoxia. The relative number of ATPase particles (F1-coupling factors) at the inner mitochondrial membranes was slightly but significantly reduced after diabetes and stronger reduced after additional hypoxia; only in the latter condition Ginkgo extract was slightly protective. The product of volume density of mitochondria x volume density of cristae x relative number of ATPase particles at the inner mitochondrial membrane (as structural equivalent of the myocardial capacity for ATP production) indicated better than single parameters the increasing mitochondrial damage after diabetes of 4 months duration and subsequent acute hypoxia of 20 min duration. After hypoxia this capacity amounted only to 46% of the normal and was improved by EGb to 53%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Anatomy, University of Leipzig, Germany. fitzlg@medizin.uni-leipzig.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fitzl", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Welt", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wassilew", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Clemens", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Penka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fckke", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Exp Toxicol Pathol", "NlmUniqueID": "9208920", "ISSNLinking": "0940-2993"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11256759", "10.1016/S0940-2993(01)80017-8", "S0940-2993(01)80017-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
