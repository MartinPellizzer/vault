However, the primary molecular target of WA is unknown. By chemical structure analysis, we hypothesized that Withaferin A might be a natural proteasome inhibitor. Computational modeling studies consistently predict that C1 and C24 of WA are highly susceptible toward a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of N-terminal threonine of the proteasomal chymotrypsin subunit beta5. Furthermore, WA potently inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of a purified rabbit 20S proteasome (IC50=4.5 microM) and 26S proteasome in human prostate cancer cultures (at 5-10 microM) and xenografts (4-8 mg/kg/day). Inhibition of prostate tumor cellular proteasome activity in cultures and in vivo by WA results in accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and three proteasome target proteins (Bax, p27, and IkappaB-alpha) accompanied by androgen receptor protein suppression (in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells) and apoptosis induction. Treatment of WA under conditions of the aromatic ketone reduction, or reduced form of Celastrol, had significantly decreased the proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities. Treatment of human prostate PC-3 xenografts with WA for 24 days resulted in 70% inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice, associated with 56% inhibition of the tumor tissue proteasomal chymotrypsinlike activity. Our results demonstrate that the tumor proteasome beta5 subunit is the primary target of WA, and inhibition of the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity by WA in vivo is responsible for, or contributes to, the antitumor effect of this ancient medicinal compound."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Prevention Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, 640.1 HWCRC, 4100 John R Road, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Huanjie", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Guoqing", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Q Ping", "Initials": "QP"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA112625", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "CA120009", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0035623", "ISSNLinking": "0026-895X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteasome Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Withanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.25.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L6DO3QW4K5", "NameOfSubstance": "withaferin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z30RAY509F", "NameOfSubstance": "Ergosterol"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Mol Pharmacol. 2015 May;87(5):865. doi: 10.1124/mol.114.030015err", "PMID": "25814535"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ergosterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Nude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteasome Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transplantation, Heterologous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Withanolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17093135", "10.1124/mol.106.030015", "mol.106.030015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
