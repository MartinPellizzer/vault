The proliferation activity of PC-12 cells was determined by 3H-TdR incorporation, and the production of PGE2 in culture supernatants of PC-12 cells was detected with competitive ELISA. Expression of COX-2 mRNA in PC-12 cells was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and expression of COX-2 protein was estimated by Western blot method and cellular enzyme immunoassay. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity in whole-cell extract of PC-12 cells was also measured by an ELISA-based method.", "The data showed that Sin down-regulated the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, and reduced the production of PGE2 in the LPS-stimulated PC-12 cells which correlated with Sin's concentrations positively. In addition, NF-kappaB activity in LPS-stimulated cells was suppressed significantly by Sin. No inhibition of proliferation of PC-12 cells due to Sin treatment was observed.", "Sin mediates the down-regulation of expression of COX-2 and production of induced PGE2 in PC-12 cells by suppressing the activity of NF-kappaB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310016, China. cc0731@hzcnc.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Yue-di", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Guang-shu", "Initials": "GS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hang-ping", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphinans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63LT81K70N", "NameOfSubstance": "sinomenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphinans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sinomenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15575215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
