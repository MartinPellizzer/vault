Despite their reliability, if standardized extracts are used, skin tests suffer from limited reproducibility due to difficulties in preparing consistently standardized extracts from natural raw material. Starting from allergen-encoding cDNAs, large amounts of highly pure allergens with a high batch-to-batch consistency satisfying the quality requirements of medicinal products manufactured by recombinant DNA technology can be produced. These reagents are expected to be qualitatively superior to the commercially available allergen preparations used for the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of allergic conditions. In this article the current literature available on skin testing with such recombinant allergens (rAllergens) is reviewed and critically analyzed. To date many different rAllergens of various pollens, moulds, mites, bee venom, latex and celery have been used in skin testing in more than 1,600 allergic and control individuals. Skin prick tests as well as intradermal skin tests with rAllergens prove to be highly specific and safe. The diagnostic sensitivity of single rAllergens is generally lower than those obtained with allergen extracts, but can be considerably increased by using rAllergen panels covering the most important allergenic structures present in a given complex allergenic extract. Moreover, quantitative skin testing with single rAllergens allows interesting insights into correlations between the in vivo and in vitro sensitization to a given allergen. In conclusion, skin testing with rAllergens offers a highly specific and safe additional diagnostic tool to elucidate patient- and disease-specific sensitization patterns which will be needed for the development of patient-tailored immunotherapeutic treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 S.
