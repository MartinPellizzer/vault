SLs are widely distributed in higher plants and are symbiotic signals between plants and Arbuscular mycorrhiza(AM), which play key roles in the evolution of plant colonizing terrestrial habitats. As a new type of plant hormone, SLs possess such important biological functions as inhibiting shoot branching(tillers), regulating root architecture, promoting secondary growth, and improving plant stress resistance. Therefore, SLs have attracted wide attention. The biological functions of SLs are not only closely related to the formation of &quot;excellent shape and quality&quot; of Chinese medicinal materials but also have important practical significance for the production of high-quality medicinal materials. However, SLs have been currently widely studied in model plants and crops such as Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, and few related studies have been reported on SLs in medicinal plants, which need to be strengthened. This review focused on the latest research progress in the isolation and identification, biological and artificial synthesis pathways, biosynthesis sites and transport modes, signal transduction pathways and mechanisms, and biological functions of SLs, and prospected the research on the regulation mechanism of SLs in the growth and development of medicinal plants and their related application on targeted regulation of Chinese herbal medicine production, which is expected to provide some references for the in-depth research on SLs in the field of Chinese medicinal resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Yinchuan 750002, China State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Yi-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Yinchuan 750002, China State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Yinchuan 750002, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Sheng-Hu", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Yinchuan 750002, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Yinchuan 750002, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-Qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China School of Pharmacy,Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "GR24 strigolactone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37381995", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20221221.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
