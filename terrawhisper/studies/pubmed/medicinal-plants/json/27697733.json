Enzymolysis is a potentially useful method for the treatment of FVW. In the present study, novel recycled magnetic molecular imprinting immobilised cellulases were prepared based on magnetic modified chitosan (MCTS) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The properties of obtained were characterised by IR and grain-size measurements. Evaluation of a single factor affecting the loading efficiency of supports and the mixed immobilised enzymes showed better capacity than single immobilised, or free, enzymes. The immobilisation process could improve cellulase stability and repeatability of the method. Meanwhile, the kinetic parameters were also verified. The immobilised enzymes retained most of their capacity after 60days' storage while free enzymes lost it within 30days. Tests showed that the immobilised enzymes developed excellent capacity and five anthocyanins were collected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
