Recently, the use of different Rosa species has increased owing to their multipurpose properties (ornamental, food and medicinal uses). In this study, 21 accessions of Rosa genotypes were compared for fruit phytochemical composition and color parameters.", "The highest antioxidant activity (37.86\u2009mg AAE g<sup>-1</sup> FW) and total phenolic (8.17\u2009mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> FW), total flavonoid (2.53\u2009mg QUE g<sup>-1</sup> FW), total carotenoid (20.21\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> FW) and ascorbic acid (84.27\u2009mg\u2009g<sup>-1</sup> FW) contents were observed in G20 (R. canina), G8 (R. canina), G9 (R. canina), G5 (R. damascena) and G10 (R. moschata) respectively. Chlorogenic acid and gallic acid were found as the main phenolic constituents of Rosa fruits. High amounts of apigenin, rutin, quercetin, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and gallic acid were obtained in fruit extracts of G6, G14, G6, G8, G19, G9, G19 and G12 respectively. Moreover, the level of color parameters also varied among genotypes. The highest values of a*, b*, L* and chroma were obtained in G4 (R. canina). Based on hierarchical clustering analysis with heat-map, five groups of accessions were identified.", "Different Rosa genotypes are rich in certain phytochemical compounds, with significant variations in their levels being observed. Hence evaluation of Rosa genetic resources can supply valuable data for screening accessions containing high levels of individual phenolics, antioxidants and other bioactive compounds for use in breeding programs and food and pharma industries. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shameh", "ForeName": "Shahla", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5882-8981"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alirezalu", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Bahman", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department of Chromatography, Iranian Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Maleki", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Urmia University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Liao L-J, Lin Y-H, Huang K-L, Chen W-S and Cheng Y-M, Postharvest life of cut rose flowers as affected by silver thiosulfate and sucrose.
