Seventy percent alcoholic extracts were found to contain 40-60% of BP passed from raw material, while aqueous extracts--2-3% (in some cases 10-14%). Maximal concentrations of BP in alcoholic extracts were 0.6-0.7 micrograms/1 and 0.03-0.04 micrograms/1--in aqueous ones. A significant correlation between BP level in extracts and its content in plants was established. BP pathways in the course of solasodine manufacturing from nightshade (Solanum lacinatum) were studied. As little as 1% of BP passed to extract after primary extraction in 2%--sulfuric acid. Solasodine contained about 3 micrograms/kg of BP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kalinina", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dikun", "ForeName": "P P", "Initials": "PP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Soderzhanie benz(a)pirena v lekarstvennykh rasteniiakh i vozmozhnosti ego perekhoda v lekarstvennye preparaty rastitel'nogo proiskhozhdeniia."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vopr Onkol", "NlmUniqueID": "0413775", "ISSNLinking": "0507-3758"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6649549"]}}]}
