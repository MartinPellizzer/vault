One aspect of this project involves changes to the ways knowledge about medicinal plants is presented. This paper contrasts the models of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) and Traditional Knowledge (TK) to illuminate some of the complexities which have arisen consequent to these changes, particularly with regard to the concept of vitalism, the retention or rejection of which may have broad implications for the clinical practice of herbal medicine. Illustrations from two herbals (central texts on the medicinal use of plants) demonstrate the differences between these frameworks in regard to how herbs are understood. Further, a review of articles on herbal therapeutics published in the Australian Journal of Herbal Medicine indicates that practitioners are moving away from TK and towards the use of EBM in their clinical discussions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural and Complementary Medicine, Southern Cross University, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia. sue.evans@scu.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "Sue", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Soc Sci Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8303205", "ISSNLinking": "0277-9536"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Review Literature as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitalism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18952343", "10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.09.046", "S0277-9536(08)00508-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
