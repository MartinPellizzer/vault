In this attempt, a chiral stationary phase (CSP) has been prepared using diol silica gel based on vancomycin CDPs which led to a new chiral selector with new functionality of functional groups on a microcolumn LC. Different kinds of mobile phases were examined to realize the behavior of the chiral selector in separation of atropine, fluoxetine, amlodipine, mandelic acid, alanine, and phenylalanine which were separated successfully on this column. Good results were obtained by using a polar mobile phase containing water, methanol, and acid additives for separation of chiral acidic compounds and amino acid samples. Considerable results were obtained for analysis of basic compounds by using polar organic mobile phase (POP) containing methanol, acid and base additives. These results can be associated with the presence of the carboxylic acid groups present in new CSP by using a diol silica gel."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gholami", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alizadeh", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aboul-Enein", "ForeName": "Hassan Y", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "60650-90-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silica Gel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6Q205EH1VU", "NameOfSubstance": "Vancomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silica Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Vancomycin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19224628", "10.1002/jssc.200800531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
