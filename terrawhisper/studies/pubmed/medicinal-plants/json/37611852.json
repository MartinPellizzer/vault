This study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of gossypol, a natural polyphenolic compound with sorafenib for treating lung cancer cells and elucidating its mechanism of action. The MTT assay was utilized to determine the IC<sub>50</sub> of sorafenib and gossypol against A549 and NCI H460 cell lines. The Chou-Talaly algorithm was employed to determine the combination index (CI). A sub-effective concentration of sorafenib and gossypol was chosen to investigate the possibility of cytotoxic synergy. Autophagy biomarkers were identified using Western blotting, and the function of autophagy was determined using ATG5 siRNA. Results show that IC<sub>50</sub> of sorafenib significantly reduced in A549 and NCI H460 cells when co-treated with gossypol. The combination treatment showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect against tested cell lines. The Chou-Talaly algorithm confirmed sorafenib's dose reduction index (DRI) up to 3.86. In A549 cells, combination treatment down-regulated p62 and up-regulated LC3-II, indicating the initiation of autophagy-dependent cytotoxicity. This was further confirmed by siRNA ATG5 knockdown. Additionally, the combination treatment exclusively targeted G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase cancer cells. In conclusion, the combination of gossypol and sorafenib shows a synergistic increase in the cytotoxic effect by promoting autophagy and apoptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
