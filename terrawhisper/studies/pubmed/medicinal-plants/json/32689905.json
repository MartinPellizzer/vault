Vegetative tissues infected with <i>C. fimbriata</i> BMPZ13 by either wounding or nonwounding inoculation methods developed typical disease symptoms, establishing black rot in stems and necrosis on buds, young leaves, and stems of sprouts, in addition to wilt on leaves and shoot cuttings, typical of vascular associated diseases. The runner hyphae of <i>C. fimbriata</i> BMPZ13 formed from germinated conidia were able to directly penetrate the epidermal cuticle for initial infection and invade sweetpotato peltate glandular trichomes, specialized secretory structures to store and secrete metabolites. A two-step biotrophic phase was observed with nonwounding inoculation on leaves and stems, featuring both intercellular and intracellular invasive hyphae, with the latter found within living cells of the leaf epidermis. Subsequent to the biotrophic phase was a necrotrophic phase displaying cell death in infected leaves and veins. Additionally, this cell death was an iron-associated ferroptosis, supporting the notion that iron is involved in the necrotrophic phase of <i>C. fimbriata</i> BMPZ13 infection. Significantly, we establish that <i>C. fimbriata</i> employs a unique infection strategy: the targeting of peltate glandular trichomes. Collectively, our findings show that <i>C. fimbriata</i> is a plant fungal pathogen with a hemibiotrophic infection style in sweetpotato vegetative tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, P.R.
