In a phytochemical investigation of the peels of <i>Punica granatum</i> L., 10 phenolic compounds containing a common hexahydroxy diphenol moiety were isolated. Three of them were identified for the first time and named as pomegranatins A-C, and from the other seven known ones, two of them were obtained from pomegranate peels for the first time. Their structures were determined via extensive spectroscopic analysis. Besides, for the sake of preliminarily comprehending their biological activities, in vitro antimicrobial, antioxidant, as well as antitumor assays were detected. In the DPPH antioxidant assay, six compounds presented significant free radical scavenging ability. Two compounds exhibited moderate antimicrobial activities against <i>Candida albicans</i>; one compound could inhibit the proliferation of both <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> within limits. Four compounds possessed weak antitumor activity toward the Hela cell line without taking into account the bioavailability of ellagitannins. Overall, these results provided further information on the structural diversity of bioactive compounds present in pomegranate peels, as well as on their biological activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Ruan", "ForeName": "Jing-Hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Adili", "ForeName": "Guliqire", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guang-Ying", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Abuduaini", "ForeName": "Munire", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Abdulla", "ForeName": "Rahima", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Maiwulanjiang", "ForeName": "Maitinuer", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lythraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pomegranate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35312314", "10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08341"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
