The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of exogenous application of the growth hormone indole acetic acid (IAA) on various morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of Withania somnifera, an indigenous medicinal plant, subjected to s-UV-B. The s-UV-B-treated plants received ambient\u00a0+\u00a03.6\u00a0kJm<sup>-2</sup> \u00b7day<sup>-1</sup> biologically effective UV-B, and IAA was applied at two doses (200 and 400\u00a0ppm) to s-UV-B-exposed plants. The plant was forced to compromise its growth, development and photosynthetic patterns to survive under s-UV-B by increasing concentrations of secondary metabolites and antioxidants (thiol, proline, ascorbic acid, \u03b1-tocopherol, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, superoxide dismutase) to counteract oxidative stress. Increases in secondary metabolites were evidenced as increased activity of phenylpropanoid pathway enzymes: phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-coumarate CoA ligase, chalcone isomerase and dihydroflavonol reductase. Application of different IAA doses reversed the detrimental effects of s-UV-B on W.\u00a0somnifera by improving growth and photosynthesis and reducing concentrations of secondary metabolites and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Antioxidant enzymes, however, had a synergistic effect on s-UV-B treatment and IAA application. The effects of s-UV-B on W.\u00a0somnifera are ameliorated to varying degrees upon exogenous IAA application, and synergistic enhancement of antioxidant enzymes under s-UV-B+IAA treatment might be responsible for the partial recuperation of growth and plant protein content, as a UV-B-exposed plant is forced to allocate most of its photosynthate towards production of enzymes related to antioxidant defence."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Takshak", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4826-1264"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Air Pollution and Global Climate Change, Department of Botany, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."}], "LastName": "Agrawal", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28707323", "10.1111/plb.12601"]}}]}
