The mechanism of action of most of these herbals/botanicals has not been subjected to thorough scientific investigations. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) represents a useful case study in this sense. Traditionally, it is used as a natural treatment for depression; however, in recent years its molecular mechanism of action has been elucidated by a number of laboratories across the world. Such studies have helped understand potential interactions of St. John's wort with drugs and other xenobiotics. St. John's wort activates a nuclear receptor called pregnane X receptor (PXR). PXR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that induces a number of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and transporters including cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) in humans. Because CYP3A4 alone metabolizes about 60% of all clinically relevant drugs, induction of CYP3A4 may result in the rapid elimination of these drugs and a consequent reduction in drug efficacy. Ironically, such enzyme-inducing effects may not produce any immediate adverse symptomatology in the person taking St. John's wort. Therefore, the case of St. John's wort should serve as a good example of the usefulness and importance of studies on the mechanism of action of the herbals/botanicals, particularly those with widespread use. Scientists, physicians, and other health professionals can make use of the knowledge from such studies as an additional risk management tool."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biotechnology and GRAS Notice Review, Office of Food Additive Safety, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, College Park, MD 20740, USA.
