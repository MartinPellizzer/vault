To overcome the inhibitory effect of fermentation environment, in-situ fermentation with gellan gum adding was carried out for the first time. After 10\u00a0days' static fermentation, both high-acyl gellan gum and low-acyl gellan gum adding showed certain beneficial effects for bacterial cellulose production that the highest bacterial cellulose yield (0.866 and 0.798\u00a0g/L, respectively) was 59% and 47% higher than that (0.543\u00a0g/L) without gellan gum adding. Besides, gellan gum based bacterial cellulose showed some better texture characteristics. Gellan gum was loaded in the nano network of bacterial cellulose, and gellan gum adding had some influence on the crystal structure and thermal degradation behaviors of bacterial cellulose but affected little on its functional groups. Overall, this in-situ fermentation technology is attractive for bacterial cellulose production from low-cost but inhibitory substrates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
