We aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of 1,8-cineole on anti-Alzheimer's disease by using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models. Our studies demonstrated that 1,8-cineole significantly relieved A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>-induced paralysis and exhibited remarkable antioxidant and anti-A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation activities in transgenic nematodes CL4176, CL2006 and CL2355. We developed a 1,8-cineole/cyclodextrin inclusion complex, displaying enhanced anti-paralysis, anti-A\u03b2 aggregation and antioxidant activities compared to 1,8-cineole. In addition, we found 1,8-cineole treatment activated the SKN-1/Nrf-2 pathway and induced autophagy in nematodes. Our results demonstrated the antioxidant and anti-Alzheimer's disease activities of 1,8-cineole, which provide a potential therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
