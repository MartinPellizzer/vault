It is reputed for its beneficial effects in the treatment of the inflammatory conditions of the eyes. The effect of QR eye drops was studied by a double-blind, randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial, conducted in 70 patients (20-60 yrs) suffering from different types of conjunctivitis, namely mucopurulent, phlyctenular and allergic conjunctivitis. Local application of two drops (3-4 times/day) of QR was applied to the affected eyes for up to 14 days. Patients were examined at the time of diagnosis and after 2, 7 and 14 days. Clinical efficacy was measured as the cumulative sum score of several signs and symptoms of different types of conjunctivitis. Side effects, if any, were also noted during the study. In mucopurulent conjunctivitis QR showed excellent results. In the few cases of phlyctenular and allergic conjunctivitis it controlled the deterioration and seems to help in improvement. There were no side effects observed during the course of the study and the eye drop was well tolerated by the patients. It is considered to be a useful drug in all conditions studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine (Unani), Jamia Hamdard (Hamdard University), Hamdard Nagar, New Delhi 110062, India. shadabzafar@radiffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ophthalmic Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Conjunctivitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ophthalmic Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12413702", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00163-0", "S0378874102001630"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
