The diagnosis was determined by fasting plasma glucose values after two-hour oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). Two authors independently extracted data and evaluated bias. The Cochrane tool of risk of Bias Tool was used.", "This review included ten trials. Most studies were highly biased as data were incomplete or reporting was selective. The two-hour fasting plasma glucose after the curcumin extract intervention showed statistical significance after 3, 6 and 9months: p<0.01. Also, glycosylated haemoglobin levels A1c (HbA1c) values after curcumin extract intervention showed statistical significance after 3, 6 and 9months: p<0.01. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) after curcumin extract intervention showed statistical significance after 6months and after 9months: p<0.05 and p<0.01.", "Curcumin has shown the confident results to be effective for the treatment of impaired glucose tolerance. Fenugreek and flaxseed may also be effective, but due to low quality of these studies the results must be interpreted with caution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
