In particular, the roots of <i>S. baicalensis</i> and the entire herb of <i>S. barbata</i> have been widely used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. The main active components of <i>Scutellaria</i>, including: baicalein, wogonin, norwogonin, scutellarein, and their glycosides have potential or existing drug usage. However, the wild resources of <i>Scutellaria</i> plants have been overexploited, and degenerated germplasm resources cannot fulfill the requirements of chemical extraction and clinical usage. Metabolic engineering and green production <i>via</i> microorganisms provide alternative strategies for greater efficiency in the production of natural products. Here, we review the progress of: pharmacological investigations, multi-omics, biosynthetic pathways, and metabolic engineering of various <i>Scutellaria</i> species and their active compounds. In addition, based on multi-omics data, we systematically analyze the phylogenetic relationships of <i>Scutellaria</i> and predict candidate transcription factors related to the regulation of active flavonoids. Finally, we propose the prospects of directed evolution of core enzymes and genome-assisted breeding to alleviate the shortage of plant resources of <i>Scutellaria</i>. This review provides important insights into the sustainable utilization and development of <i>Scutellaria</i> resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Harbin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xinyi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China National Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Sihao", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Harbin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaotong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Harbin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Harbin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Ali Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Basit", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Artemisinin Research Center, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ranran", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1753-5602"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Harbin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Zhichao", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36581326", "10.1080/07388551.2022.2149386"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
