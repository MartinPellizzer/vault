It is considered as safe and has been used in nanomedicine. But literature still states its toxicity depending upon the size and dose of silicon nanoparticles. So, current study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of silicon dioxide nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs) by Allium anaphase-telophase and Comet tests. Characterization of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs showed the particle size as 16.12\u2009\u00b1\u20093.07 nm. The mean diameter of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs was having range of 404.66\u2009\u00b1\u200993.39 nm in solution. Highest total anomalies (18.80\u2009\u00b1\u20090.45) were observed at 100 \u00b5g/mL, whereas least (11.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.84) were observed by the 12.5 \u00b5g/mL concentration. There was concentration-response association in increased CAs and DNA damage. The highest concentration (100 \u00b5g/mL) of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs induced the significant DNA damage (149.67\u2009\u00b1\u20091.15), whereas the least was observed by the negative control (2.67\u2009\u00b1\u20090.58). The current study revealed the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of SiO<sub>2</sub>NPs on the root meristem cells of A. cepa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biology and Genetics Department, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, U\u015fak University, 64200, U\u015fak, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Liman", "ForeName": "Recep", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Materials Science and Nanotechnology Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, U\u015fak University, 64200, U\u015fak, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Acikbas", "ForeName": "Yaser", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biology and Genetics Department, Faculty of Science and Literature, Afyon Kocatepe University, 03200, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ci\u011ferci", "ForeName": "\u0130brahim Hakk\u0131", "Initials": "\u0130H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. muddassir.ali@uvas.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Muhammad Muddassir", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Program, Meram Vocational School, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kars", "ForeName": "Meltem Demirel", "Initials": "MD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "7631-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Meristem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Dioxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31932906", "10.1007/s00128-020-02783-3", "10.1007/s00128-020-02783-3"]}}]}
