Previous reports suggested the potential of protein kinases to target lung cancer by regulating autophagy. This study establishes the role of aescin, a triterpenoid saponin, in targeting protein kinases responsible for lung cancer proliferation and mobility. The experimental data revealed that aescin significantly impedes lung cancer cell proliferation by downregulating protein kinases such as AKT, mTOR, MEK, and ERK. Downregulation of AKT-mTOR may promote a string of events inducing cytotoxic autophagy-mediated apoptosis in the presence of aescin. Besides, aescin decreases mobility and invasion by downregulating HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF gene expressions. Moreover, it successfully monitors EGFR gene expression, improves lung histology, and regulates biochemical parameters in a pre-clinical DEN-induced lung cancer model. Aescin was observed to be safe and non-toxic in both in silico toxicity predictions and ex vivo erythrocyte fragility assays. Hence, this study elucidates the molecular mechanism of aescin in targeting protein kinases and suggests that it could be a safer and more viable therapeutic agent for lung cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
