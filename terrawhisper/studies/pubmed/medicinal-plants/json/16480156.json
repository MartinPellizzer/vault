Isolation and concentration of volatile compounds were performed by a single stage. The product solutions of volatile compounds were directly analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The essential oils fiom aromatic herbs (basil, crispate mint, thyme) and spices (ajowan, cumin, star anise) extracted by SFME for 30 minutes and I hour, were similar to those obtained by conventional hydro-distillation (HD)for (respectively) 4 and 8 hours. Substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes hydrocarbons are present in the essential oils of the aromatic plants extracted by SFME in comparison with HD. Solvent-free microwave extraction is clearly advantageous to conventional distillation in terms of rapidity, efficiency, cleanliness, substantial saving of energy, and is environmentally friendly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Chimie des Substances Naturelles et des Sciences des Aliments Facult\u00e9 des Sciences et Technologies, Universit\u00e9 de la R\u00e9union, 15 avenue Ren\u00e9 Cassin, B.P. 7151, F-97715 Saint Denis messag Cedex 9, La R\u00e9union, France."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lucchesi", "ForeName": "Marie E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chemat", "ForeName": "Farid", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smadja", "ForeName": "Jacqueline", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Microw Power Electromagn Energy", "NlmUniqueID": "8706313", "ISSNLinking": "0832-7823"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16480156", "10.1080/08327823.2004.11688514"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
