The results showed that water in Paeoniae Radix Alba fresh products was major of free water, and in the boiling process, the content of free water increased whereas the content of bound water declined. At the end of boiling, content of free water reached over 90%. During the drying process, T \u2082 moved to the left, and moisture mobility was reduced. The MRI image directly showed that moisture transfer was outside-in process for both increase and decrease. At the end of drying, remaining moisture was mainly present in inner layer of Paeoniae Radix Alba. Quality and appearance were affected by the change of moisture during processing process of medicinal herbs. NMR and MRI could provide direct reference evidence for its moisture changes, and the results of this study could provide direct references and technical support for optimization of processing process of root medicinal materials and evaluation of Chinese herbal pieces."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Wen-Juan", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guo-Hong", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28822153", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170415.004"]}}]}
