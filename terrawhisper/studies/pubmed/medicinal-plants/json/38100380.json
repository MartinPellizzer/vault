The potential of the isolated compounds against SARS-CoV-2 was suggested through several <i>in silico</i> analysis. Structural similarity studies against nine co-crystallized ligands of SARS-CoV-2's proteins indicated the similarities of the isolated cannflavins with the SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like Protease (PLP) ligand, <b>Y95</b>. Then, flexible allignment study confirmed this similarity. Docking experiments showed successful binding of all cannflavins within the active pocket of PLP, with energies comparable to <b>Y95</b>. Among them, cannflavin A demonstrated the most similar binding mode, while cannflavin C exhibited the best energy. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM-GPSA confirmed the accurate binding of cannflavin A to the PLP. <i>In silico</i> ADMET studies indicated favourable drug-like properties for all three compounds, suggesting their potential as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Further <i>In vitro</i> and <i>In vivo</i> investigations are necessary to validate these findings and establish their efficacy and safety profiles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Minia University, Minia, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Wanas", "ForeName": "Amira S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."}], "LastName": "Radwan", "ForeName": "Mohamed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Assiut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Marzouk", "ForeName": "Adel A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, AlMaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Elkaeed", "ForeName": "Eslam B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alsfouk", "ForeName": "Bshra A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0379-9802"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mostafa", "ForeName": "Ahmad E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Eissa", "ForeName": "Ibrahim H", "Initials": "IH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8566-1980"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Boys), Al-Azhar University, Cairo, Egypt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biopharmaceutical Products Research Department, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Research Institute, City of Scientific Research and Technological Applications (SRTA-City), Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Metwaly", "ForeName": "Ahmed M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, Mississippi, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics and Drug Delivery, School of Pharmacy, University, Mississippi, USA."}], "LastName": "ElSohly", "ForeName": "Mahmoud A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38100380", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2294111"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
