All the patients were prisoners in a labour camp under similar nutritional and physical conditions at the outbreak of the syndome. The main symptoms were spastic paraparesis and a neurogenic bladder, both of varying degree. In addition lower motor neuron involvement with muscular atrophies was noticed in 14 cases and simulated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A lathyric sensory neuropathy was found in 12 patients. No cranial lesions or psychiatric disorders were found. Laboratory tests including 5 CSF specimens were normal. HLA typing was unremarkable. Our overall impression was that chronic neurolathyrism in the long run shows a gradually slow progressive course."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cohn", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Streifler", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Schweiz Arch Neurol Neurochir Psychiatr", "NlmUniqueID": "8709012", "ISSNLinking": "0036-7273"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Lathyrism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Spasticity"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Neuromuscular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Paralysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7244573"]}}]}
