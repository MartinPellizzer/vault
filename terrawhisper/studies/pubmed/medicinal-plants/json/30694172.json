The strain did not produce endospores and its cells could secrete mucus. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositolmannosides, two unknown aminolipids, two unknown glycolipids and an unknown phospholipid. Branched fatty acids (iso-) and hydroxy fatty acids were the main fatty acids, which mainly included iso-C15\u200a:\u200a0, iso-C15\u200a:\u200a1 G and iso-C17\u200a:\u200a0 3-OH. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain HBUM179779<sup>T</sup> fell within the family Chitinophagaceae, and its closest neighbour was Pseudoflavitalea rhizosphaerae T16R-265<sup>T</sup> (94.46\u200a%). However, strain HBUM179779<sup>T</sup> did not make a coherent clade with members of the recognized organisms. The average nucleotide identity value between strain HBUM179779<sup>T</sup> and Pseudoflavitalea rhizosphaerae T16R-265<sup>T</sup> was 67.1\u200a%. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics of this bacterium, a novel genus and species, Gynurincola endophyticus gen. nov., sp. nov., is proposed. The type strain is HBUM179779<sup>T</sup> (=CGMCC 1.15525<sup>T</sup>=NBRC 112424<sup>T</sup>)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1\u200bCollege of Life Sciences, Hebei University;
