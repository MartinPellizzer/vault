It induced maximal proliferation at greater than 20 micrograms IgM/ml after 3-4 days of culture. Cells stimulated by K46M produced interleukin 2 (IL-2) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and expressed receptors for IL-2 and transferrin. The majority of the activated cells were phenotypically T cells as defined by monoclonal antibodies against CD3 and CD2, and an increase in the K46M-positive cells was also observed during the activation period. K46M-activated cells display major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted cytotoxicity against several cultured target cells. The frequencies of the cytotoxic and of the proliferative precursor cells were determined using a limiting dilution assay. K46M seems to activate a larger fraction of cytotoxic precursor cells against Molt 4 than against K562, but the statistical significance of these observations requires further exploration. Both K46M or La activated 40% of PBL to proliferate, whereas 70% of PBL were induced by OKT3. However, the frequency of K46M-activated cells was 40% only when the lymphocytes were plated at low cell densities, i.e. less than 0.5 cells per well. At higher densities an inhibition of proliferation was seen that resulted in a biphasic response curve, indicating that the activation of PBL by K46M was not a single hit event. This was not found with either La or OKT3. Whether K46M, in contrast to OKT3 and La, activates a subpopulation with suppressor activity remains to be established."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Stockholm, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Berzins", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vargas-Cortes", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Larsson", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aguilar-Santelises", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hammarstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perlmann", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0323767", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "leukoagglutinins, plants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Surface"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3266027", "10.1111/j.1365-3083.1988.tb01511.x"]}}]}
