People are consuming herbal and dietary supplements along with western medications simultaneously. Sometimes, supplements and drugs react with one another via antagonistic or potentiation actions of the drug or supplement resulting in an adverse event. Unfortunately, it is not easy to study drug-supplement interactions without a standard terminology to describe herbal and dietary supplements. This pilot study investigated coverage of supplement databases to one another as well as coverage by the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and RxNorm for supplement terms. We found that none of the supplement databases completely covers supplement terms. UMLS, MeSH, SNOMED CT, RxNorm and NDF-RT cover 54%, 40%, 32%, 22% and 14% of supplement concepts, respectively. NDF-RT provides some value for grouping supplements into drug classes. Enhancing our understanding of the gap between the traditional biomedical terminology systems and supplement terms could lead to the development of a comprehensive terminology resources for supplements, and other secondary uses such as better detection and extraction of drug-supplement interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Heath Informatics, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}], "LastName": "Manohar", "ForeName": "Nivedha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Heath Informatics, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "Terrance J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Heath Informatics, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}], "LastName": "Pakhomov", "ForeName": "Serguei V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Heath Informatics, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}], "LastName": "Melton", "ForeName": "Genevieve B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Heath Informatics, University of Minnesota, MN, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 HS022085", "Acronym": "HS", "Agency": "AHRQ HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "UL1 TR000114", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "1R01HS022085-01", "Acronym": "HS", "Agency": "AHRQ HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "8UL1TR000114-02", "Acronym": "TR", "Agency": "NCATS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Stud Health Technol Inform", "NlmUniqueID": "9214582", "ISSNLinking": "0926-9630"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medical Subject Headings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RxNorm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Unified Medical Language System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ventola CL.
