In the present study, the effects of l-THP on locomotor sensitization to oxycodone, which is an opioid receptor agonist, were studied.", "Mice treated daily for 7 d with 5 mg/kg oxycodone and challenged with the same dose after 5 days of washout showed locomotor sensitization. In order to study the effects of l-THP on locomotor sensitization induced by oxycodone, l-THP was administered at doses of 6.25, 12.5, and 18.75 mg/kg, 40 min prior to treatment of oxycodone.", "l-THP per se did not affect the locomotor activity at the doses of 6.25, 12.5, and 18.75 mg/kg, but could antagonize the hyperactivity induced by oxycodone (5 mg/kg). Co-administration of l-THP (18.75 mg/kg), 40 min prior to oxycodone, could inhibit the development of sensitization to oxycodone. In addition, l-THP (6.25, 12.5, and 18.75 mg/kg, i.g.) dose-dependently prevented the expression of oxycodone sensitization.", "These results suggested that l-THP could attenuate the locomotor-stimulating effects of oxycodone and inhibit the development and expression of oxycodone behavioral sensitization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Beijing 100850, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-li", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jian-hui", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Ling-di", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Rui-bin", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Chun-fu", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Ze-hui", "Initials": "ZH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3X69CO5I79", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrahydropalmatine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CD35PMG570", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxycodone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Oxycodone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Opioid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15842769", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00101.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
