Its young and mature leaves are used as food and medicine, respectively. Glandular trichomes (GTs) are distributed on the leaf surface in A. argyi and are generally considered the location of flavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation. However, the mechanism of flavonoid biosynthesis and accumulation in A. argyi remains unclear. In this study, the coregulatory genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development in this species were screened and evaluated, and the biosynthetic pathways for key flavonoids in A. argyi were uncovered. AaMYB1 and AaYABBY1 were screened using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and both genes were then genetically transformed into Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. K326 (tobacco). Simultaneously, AaYABBY1 was also genetically transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. The total flavonoid and rutin contents were increased in tobacco plants overexpressing AaMYB1 and AaYABBY1, and the expression levels of genes participating in the flavonoid synthesis pathway, such as PAL, FLS, and F3H, were significantly up-regulated in plants overexpressing these genes. These results indicated that AaMYB1 and AaYABBY1 promote flavonoid biosynthesis in tobacco. Furthermore, compared to that in the wild-type, the trichome density was significantly increased in tobacco and A. thaliana plants overexpressing AaYABBY1. These results confirm that AaYABBY1 might be involved in regulating trichome formation in A. argyi. This indicates the potential genes involved in and provides new insights into the development of trichome cellular factories based on the \"development-metabolism\" interaction network and the cultivation of high-quality A. argyi."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
