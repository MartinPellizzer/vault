Researchers are focusing on an extract of garlic called ajoene which also appears to protect CD+ cells from attack by HIV early in the viral life cycle. At low concentrations, the drug appears to have little toxicity, and its anti-HIV activity is 45 times more powerful than the drug dextran sulfate. Ajoene is found only in fresh garlic and is not readily available. One researcher found that garlic impairs the activity of the liver enzymes that process protease inhibitors and raises the protease inhibitor levels."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [], "GeneralNote": [], "PMID": "11365438", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "08", "Day": "25"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2006", "Month": "08", "Day": "01"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1181-7186", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "May"}}, "Title": "TreatmentUpdate", "ISOAbbreviation": "TreatmentUpdate"}, "ArticleTitle": "Garlic extract for HIV?", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "1", "EndPage": "2", "MedlinePgn": "1-2"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Newspaper Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "TreatmentUpdate", "NlmUniqueID": "100891076", "ISSNLinking": "1181-7186"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11365438"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
