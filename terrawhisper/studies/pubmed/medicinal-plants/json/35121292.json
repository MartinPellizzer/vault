The as-prepared BCO-xerogel was used as a low-cost green adsorbent for the eliminate of four types of the most widely used antibiotics, including amoxicillin (AMX), tetracycline (TC), cefalexin (CLX), and penicillin G (PEN G) residuals from contaminated water. The simultaneous effects conventional variables including adsorbent dosage, antibiotic concentrations, solution pH, and contact time were studied and optimized by central composite design (CCD) under response surface methodology (RSM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed as a statistical formula to determine the significance of operating environmental conditions and their interactions with 95% confidence limits. Under optimized conditions, the experimental removal efficiencies for AMX, TC, CLX, and PEN G were 98.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.25, 99.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.52, 98.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.98, and 98.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.19, respectively. The adsorption isotherms and kinetics were better fitted with Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption process was endothermic, spontaneous, and occurred by combination of physical and chemical mechanisms. Also, evaluating the ability of BCO-xerogel to adsorptive removal of AMX, TC, CLX, and PEN G antibiotics in real wastewaters showed about 97.4-98.6% adsorption efficiency in river water and about 67.1-71.3% in three hospital effluents. After the adsorption process, the antibiotic-loaded adsorbent was regenerated by NaOH (0.01\u00a0mol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>), and the reusability tests showed that the removal efficiencies of the antibiotics in the four recovery steps were still above 90%. This work explored the development of green, efficient, and economical bio-adsorbent that can be utilized for the removal of antibiotics from contaminated wastewaters."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
