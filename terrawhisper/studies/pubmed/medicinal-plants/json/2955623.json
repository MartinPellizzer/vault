The experiment was carried out without the use of a control group. Aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of the product. In addition to the clinical evaluation of the symptoms, laboratory tests were performed. The patients were treated for 3 months with a daily dose of 2 teaspoons every evening. In the majority of the subjects a good clinical response was obtained; 88% of the patients presented a normalization of the gastrointestinal transit time; only 12% of them did not respond satisfactorily to the substance. Further the drug was well tolerated by 86% of the patients. In conclusion the authors report a good efficacy and tolerability of the product; thus they recommend its use in those disorders characterized by slow intestinal transit time and/or constipation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bossi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arsenio", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bodria", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Magnati", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Trovato", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Strata", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Studio clinico su un nuovo preparato di semi di piantaggine e frutti di senna."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biomed Ateneo Parmense", "NlmUniqueID": "8106323"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76359-32-5", "NameOfSubstance": "ispaghula, senna drug combination"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8013-11-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Senna Extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Constipation"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Motility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Senna Extract"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2955623"]}}]}
