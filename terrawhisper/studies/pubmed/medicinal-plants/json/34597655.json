The CVC or cervical spinal cord contusion exemplar has also been used to induce neuropathic pain.", "TPEO (50, 100, and 150\u00a0mg/kg) relative to control mice in the phase-II of FML provided strong antinociception (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). Furthermore, methylene blue, glibenclamide, N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, naloxonazine, nor-binaltorphimine, prazosin, yohimbine, and ondansetron pre-treating restored the TPEO anti-nociceptive activity in the FML (phase-II) exemplar (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In phase-II of the FML exemplar, carvacrol (one of the active components of TPEO) also greatly reduced pain (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Likewise, in CVC mice, TPEO altered mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia.", "It was attained magnificently that TPEO could exerts antinociceptive effects through the involvement of L-arginine/NO/cGMP/KATP signaling pathway, adrenergic, opioid, and serotonin receptors. Moreover, it is demonstrate that anti-neuropathic activity of TPEO may be mediated by inflammatory function."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
