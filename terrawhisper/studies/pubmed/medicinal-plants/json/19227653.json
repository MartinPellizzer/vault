Generally, the tea leaf is drank after being decocted (almost boiled). The growth distribution of tea ranges in a belt-like zone of 30-40 degrees north latitude. Therefore, tea might have grown wild as \"YAMACHA (mountain tea)\" from ancient times in Japan as well as China. The first recored of tea drinking in Japan is the ceremony of \"GYOUCHA\" at the Imperial Court of the Emperor SHOUMU in 729. On the other hand, the oldest book about tea in China (CHAKYOU) was written in 770. Therefore, it seems that tea drinking started at nearly the same time in both countries. Tea was dispensed as medical supplies by Chinese medicinal prescription (SENKYUCHACHOUSAN) in Japan, but in China, tea was used as powdered medicine for drinking (SEICHA). However, the leaf of a certain plant used as \"tea out of tea,\" was applied as a galenical preparation for traditional Chinese medicinal constitution. However, it is not possible to judge whether or not there was adaptability in Chinese medicine theory. In Japan, when tea was first consumed as a food, other than a few exceptions tea leaves were used as a coarse tea (BANCHA) until the latter half of the Meiji period. Mixing in air by stirring a tea solution, and at the same time, letting tea match with hot water. It was wisdom to improve the taste. As a result, in order to make bubble well, both of the condition and technique were devised. One of the approaches was to add the dried plant of Leguminosae (saponin) or tea flower (saponin), when \"BANCHA\" was decorted. And also tools such as a bamboo tea whisk (CHASEN) as well as bowl (GOROHACHI-CHAWAN), were conceived. \"FURICHA\" was served as a medicine by KUUYASHOUNIN in Japan in 951. Afterwards, the prayer ceremonies at shrines and temples used CHARAZU,\" showing the custom to serve tea in 1400. The custom of tea serving continues today, and the tea flower continues to be used according to the demand. After that, it seems that \"FURICHA\" (tea with bubbles) continued to be used for 640 years, until 1590 (AZUCHI-MOMOYAMA period) because MANCHARAZU was regarded as important in religion. Then, it is believed that the customs of \"BOTEBOTECHA\" and/or\"BATABATACHA\" succeeded traditionally. The culture of both tea drinking and cooking, each development course, existed respectively from the relations of tea and food. The state that was accompanied with neither tea nor cooking, such as \"KISHUU-CHAGAYU (tea gruel)\" and BOTEBOTECHA, continued for a while, but it was combined together as \"ICHIJUU-ICHISSA (one soup one tea)\" of \"KAISEKIRYOURI (tea-ceremony dish).\" It is noteworthy that the tea flower is used as preserved food seasoned with \"MISO (fermented soybean paste)\" and \"TSUKUDANI (boiled food in sweetened soy sauce).\" Even though old documents about the use of tea flowers as food in China were not found, according to literature in the past ten years, seven descriptions were found that the tea flower was used for food provided alone or with black tea, oolong tea or green tea. As for tea leaves and tea flowers being used as medicine, drink or food in Japan, as well as in neighboring countries which belong to the Lucidophyllous forest zone. The process that they were regarded as important with the time was investigated and reported here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research and Technology Institute, Kinki University, 3-4-1 Kowakae, Higashi-osaka, Osaka 577-8502."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harima", "ForeName": "Shoichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tokuoka", "ForeName": "Kiyoshi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Ancient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19227653"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
