A. nepalensis leaf extracts were tested in-vitro against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum NF54 by measuring the parasite specific lactate dehydrogenase activity. Among all, the chloroform extract (ANC) has shown promising anti-plasmodial activity (IC50 8.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26\u2009\u00b5g/mL). HPLC analysis of ANC showed the presence of diarylheptanoids. Efficacy and safety of ANC were further validated in in-vivo system using Plasmodium berghei-induced malaria model and acute oral toxicity in mice. Malaria was induced by intra-peritoneal injection of P. berghei infected red blood cells to the female Balb/c mice. ANC was administered orally at doses of 100 and 300\u2009mg/kg/day following Peter's 4\u2009day suppression test. Oral administration of ANC showed significant reduction of parasitaemia and increase in mean survival time. It also attributed to inhibition of the parasite induced pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as afford to significant increase in the blood glucose and haemoglobin level when compared with vehicle-treated infected mice. In-vivo safety evaluation study revealed that ANC is non-toxic at higher concentration.
