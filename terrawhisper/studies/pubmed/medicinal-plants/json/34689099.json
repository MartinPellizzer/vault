(Hypericaceae) has been used as a folk Chinese medicine for the treatment of inflammatory related diseases. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a crucial target for the development of agents to treat inflammation. To search for anti-inflammatory compounds from traditional Chinese medicines, a chemical constituent study along with COX-2 inhibitory activity analysis was performed for this plant. In this study, sixteen chemical monomers, including three undescribed oxidative degradation polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs, hypemoins C-E), two undescribed PPAPs (hypemoins A and B), and 11 known compounds, were identified from the flowers of H. monogynum. Their structures were characterized by HRESIMS, NMR techniques, ECD, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Four flavonoid derivatives showed remarkable COX-2 inhibitory activities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.220\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006 to 1.655\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.098\u00a0\u03bcM. Among these compounds, the possible recognition mechanism between quercetin 3-(6\u2033-O-caffeoyl)-\u03b2-3-D-galactoside and COX-2 was predicted by molecular docking analysis. Moreover, the multidrug resistance reversal activities for the selected compounds were evaluated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
