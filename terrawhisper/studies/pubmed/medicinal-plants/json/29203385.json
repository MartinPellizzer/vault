Osteosarcoma tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained from 57 osteosarcoma patients. Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were assigned into designated groups including the blank, siRNA-negative control (NC) and siRNA-DNA-PKcs groups. RT-qPCR and Western blotting methods were employed to evaluate the mRNA and protein expressions of DNA-PKcs. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to assess cell viability. The evaluation of cell migration and invasion were conducted by means of Scratch test and Transwell assay. Flow cytometry with PI and annexin V/PI double staining was applied for the analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis. Twenty-Four Balb/c nude mice were recruited and randomly divided into the blank, siRNA-NC and siRNA-DNA-PKcs groups. Tumorigenicity of the Balb/c nude mice was conducted to evaluate the rate of tumor formation, as well as for the assessment of tumor size and weight, and confirm the number of lung metastatic nodules in the mice post transfection. Osteosarcoma tissues were found to possess greater expression of DNA-PKcs than that of the adjacent normal tissues. DNA-PKcs expression in osteosarcoma tissues were correlated with the clinical stage and metastasis. Compared with the blank and siRNA-NC groups, proliferation, miration, as well as the invasion abilities of the MG-63 cells increased. Furthermore, an increase in apoptosis and cells at the G1 stage in the MG-63 cells was observed, while there were reductions in the cells detected at the S stage. The mRNA and protein expressions of CyclinD1, PCNA, Bcl-2 decreased while those of Bax increased in the siRNA-DNA-PKcs group. The tumor formation rate, tumor diameter, weight and lung metastatic nodules among the nude mice in the siRNA-DNA-PKcs group were all lower than those in the blank and siRNA-NC groups. The observations and findings of the study suggested that the silencing of DNA-PKcs inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion, while acting to promote cell apoptosis in MG-63 cells and osteosarcoma growth in nude mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
