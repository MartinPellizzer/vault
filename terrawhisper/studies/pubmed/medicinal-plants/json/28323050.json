Selectivity of extracts and purified compounds for Plasmodium parasites was evaluated by using WST-1 test on HeLa human cells. Compounds were isolated using normal phase silica gel column chromatography and prepHPLC and their structures elucidated using extensive spectroscopic analysis.", "Hydroethanolic extracts (70% v/v) of M. benthamianum leaves showed a moderate in vitro activity against P. falciparum 3D7, with IC<sub>50</sub> in the range 22.5 - 32.6\u00b5g/mL, depending on the batch; while a dark precipitate formed during ethanol evaporation showed higher activity (IC<sub>50</sub> =6.5\u00b5g/mL). The fractionation was performed on this most active fraction and was followed by in vitro antiplasmodial assay. Active compounds (5, 7, 8) belong to several phytochemical classes, contributing together to the global antiplasmodial activity of the hydroethanolic extract against P. falciparum parasite. This study finally allowed the isolation of three diterpenes including two new compounds named Mezobenthamic acids A (1) and B (2) and neocaesalpin H (3), as well as quercetin (4), kaempferol (7), resveratrol (6), gallic acid (9) and its ethylester (5), \u03b2-sitosterol glucoside (10) and 13b-hydroxy-pheophorbide a (8).", "This study gives some concrete evidence to support the ethnopharmacological use of Mezoneuron benthamianum leaves extract in the management of malaria. The active compounds can be further studied for their antiplasmodial potential, as well as their suitability to be used as quality markers for the standardization of this herbal drug from the Guinean traditional pharmacopeia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
