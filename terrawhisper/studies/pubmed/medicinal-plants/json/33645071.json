Intestinal sac fluid samples were collected in different part of intestine(duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon) at different time after administration of different concentration of P. orientale extract(5.0,10.0, 20.0 mg\u00b7mL~(-1)). An UPLC-TQD method was employed for the determination of six components including orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, protocatechuic acid, kaempferol-3-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside and quercitrin in the intestinal sac samples. The absorption rate and cumulative absorption were calculated to analyze the intestinal absorption characteristics of six components in normal and myocardial ischemia model rats. The P-glycoprotein(P-gp) inhibitor was applied to investigate influence of intestinal absorption of six components in P. orientale extract. The results showed that the main absorption sites were concentrated on the duodenum at low concentration, while they were the colon at the medium concentration and the ileum at high concentration in control groups. In the condition of myocardial ischemia model, the main absorption sites focus on the ileum and jejunum at low concentration; the main absorption sites were in the ileum at the medium concentration and main absorption sites were the duodenum and ileum at high concentration. Compared with the normal group, the absorption rate and cumulative absorption of the six components significantly decreased in the model group. P-gp inhibitor markedly increased the absorption rate and cumulative absorption of six components in the model group, inferring that the 6 components may be the substrates of P-gp, and the mechanism needs further study. In this study, it is revealed that the six components of P. orientale extract can be absorbed into the intestinal sac, and it is an effective method to assess the intestinal absorption characteristics of P. orientale extract through everted intestinal sac model, providing data support for the clinical application and further development of P. orientale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chun-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ming-Jin", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shu-Ting", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "L628TT009W", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoproterenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoproterenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polygonum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645071", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20201010.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
