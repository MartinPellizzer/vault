Its identity was established by a chromatographic comparison with hamamelose isolated from the bark of witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana L.). Following vacuum infiltration of the [1-14C]hamamelose into leaf discs from Phaseolus vulgaris L., 14C-labeled 2carboxy-D-arabinitol (CA) and 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1-phosphate (CA1P) were formed, in the dark. Conversion of hamamelose to both CA and CA1P in the leaf discs was inhibited by dithiothreitol and sodium fluoride, although at high concentrations of these inhibitors conversion into CA was still evident when conversion into CA1P was totally inhibited. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves converted hamamelose into CA without formation of CA1P. Leaves from P. vulgaris contained 68 nmol.g-1 fresh weight of hamamelose in the light and 35 nmol.g-1 fresh weight in the dark. A pathway for the biosynthesis of CA1P from Calvin cycle intermediates is proposed which includes the sequence: hamamelose --> CA --> CA1P."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Physiology, IACR-Rothamsted, Harpenden, Hertfordshire AL5 2JQ, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Andralojc", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Keys", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martindale", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dawson", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parry", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-carboxyarabinitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexoses"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentosephosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106777-19-9", "NameOfSubstance": "2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3107IMR9FU", "NameOfSubstance": "hamamelose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexoses"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pentosephosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Alcohols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8900161", "10.1074/jbc.271.43.26803", "S0021-9258(18)35385-7"]}}]}
