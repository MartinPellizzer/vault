In July 2019, a new anthracnose-like leaf spot disease was observed in Banqiao Town, Enshi, Hubei, China. The incidence rate ranged from 10% to 20%. Infected leaves firstly showed oil-like dots, further gradually expanded to irregular whorls with a pale center and dark-brown edge. Petiole infection led to leaves dropping when severe occurrence. Black acervuli were developed on the infected leaves with abundant setae, especially near veins. To identify the causal agent, 4-mm<sup>2</sup> tissues were derived from the disease-health junction and surface-disinfected with 0.1% mercury dichloride for 1 min and 75% ethanol for 30 s respectively. They were placed on a PDA plate and incubated at 25\u00b0C after being rinsed with sterile water three times. Isolates were purified by single spore isolation. Colonies on PDA were white to pale-gray with dense aerial mycelia, and the underside was yellowish to olive. Colonies grow 77.5 to 81.5 mm in 1 week. No conidia were observed during vegetable growth, but conidiomatal acervuli were found on infected leaves. Setae were 1-3 septate, dark-brown, 78.0 to 134.5 \u00b5m (mean = 108 \u00b1 23.4) long, 4.1 to 9.1 \u00b5m (mean = 6.1 \u00b1 1.1) diameter, cylindrical to conical, apices acute. Conidiophores hyaline to pale brown, septate. Conidia were hyaline, unicellular, aseptate, curved, cylindrical, often guttulate, measuring 20.1 to 28.0 \u00d7 3.5 to 5.4 \u00b5m (mean = 25.4 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m), L/W ratio = 5.6. Hyphae septate branched, hyaline to pale brown, 1.6 to 4.5 in diameter. Hyphopodial appressoria pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, globose or obovoid, 6.3 to 9.9 \u00d7 4.1 to 7.6 \u00b5m (mean = 8.3 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 7.6 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b5m), L/W ratio = 1.1. Morphological features were similar to the description of <i>C. jinshuiense</i> (Fu et al. 2019). To identify its phylogenetic position, maximum-likelihood (ML) analyses of two isolates (Esh8 and Esh 11) were implemented with a concatenation of multiple sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>), actin (<i>ACT</i>), beta-tubulin (<i>TUB2</i>), and chitin-synthase 1 (<i>CHS-1</i>) using MEGA 7. The sequences were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4, GDF1/GDR1, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, T1/Bt2b, CHS-79F/CHS-354R (Weir et al. 2012) and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MW440484 - MW440485 (ITS), MW676256 - MW676257 (<i>GAPDH</i>), MW676252 - MW676253 (<i>ACT</i>), MW676254 - MW676255 (TUB2) and MW676258 - MW676259 (<i>CHS-1</i>). Results indicated they were clustered with <i>C. jinshuiense</i> in the <i>C. dematium</i> species complex. Isolates were inoculated onto injured healthy leaves (20 leaves) with mycelial plugs, ten leaves being inoculated with blank plugs were used as control. Disease symptoms were consistent with those observed in the field after five days post-inoculation with a 100% incidence rate, while no symptom was observed on the control leaves. And same isolates were isolated from six inoculated leaves with 100% re-isolation frequency. These results fulfilled Koch's postulates. In a previous study, <i>C. boninense</i> was identified as the causal agent of goldthread anthracnose in Chongqing, China (Ding et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this study is the first report of anthracnose on goldthread caused by <i>C. jinshuiense</i> in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection and Soil Science, No.18, Nanhu Avenue, Hongshan Distinct, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, P.
