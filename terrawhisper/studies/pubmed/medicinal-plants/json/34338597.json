Therefore, a combined molecular modeling study was performed on a series of quinazoline derivatives as EGFR inhibitors. The optimum ligand-based CoMFA and CoMSIA models showed reliable and satisfactory predictability (with R<sup>2</sup><sub>cv</sub>=0.681, R<sup>2</sup><sub>ncv</sub>=0.844, R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>=0.8702 and R<sup>2</sup><sub>cv</sub>=0.643, R<sup>2</sup><sub>ncv</sub>=0.874, R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>=0.6423). The derived contour maps provide structural features to improve inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the contour maps, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have good consistency, illustrating that the derived models are reliable. In addition, MD simulations and binding free energy calculations were also carried out to understand the conformational fluctuations at the binding pocket of the receptor. The results indicate that hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions play significant roles on activity and selectivity. Furthermore, amino acids Val31, Lys50, Thr95, Leu149 and Asp160 are considered as essential residues to participate in the ligand-receptor interactions. Overall, this work would offer reliable theoretical basis for future structural modification, design and synthesis of novel EGFR inhibitors with good potency.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
