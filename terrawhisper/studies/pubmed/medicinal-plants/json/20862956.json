Twenty six villages and towns, which are at an elevation of 500 m to 2000 m, were investigated.", "A total of 214 specimens were collected and identified according to morphological characteristics. All investigated spots had Paris genus resources distribution but there always had a small Paris population less than 20. The Paris genus is an understory plants which lives always in a specific environment beside creek in hill valley and with many commensal plants such as bamboo and broadleaf. Three species of Paris, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, P. polyphylla var. chinensis, and P. vietnamensis were collected and identified.", "Paris genus resources declined rapidly in recent year, particular the P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis.
