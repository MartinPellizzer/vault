The informants were residents, belonging to families living in the study area since generations, and involved, at least partially, in agriculture.", "A total of 120 botanical taxa were recorded. Ethnobotanical data included medicinal (40.4%), alimentary (46.5%), veterinary (4.6%), domestic and cosmetic (4.3%), magic and ritual (1.8%) and other uses (2.4%). Medicinal plants are used to treat a wide range of diseases, mainly disorders of digestive system, skin, and genital-urinary and respiratory traits. The key role played by undomesticated edible herbs, locally known as \"erbette\", in traditional cooking recipes of RS was shown. These botanicals are rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, vitamins, complex sugars, essential fatty acids and fibers, and therefore might offer a valid protection against pathological conditions. Plant uses by RS people were compared with previous ethnobotanical literature, concerning the neighbouring areas of Liguria. Our results highlight the role of the traditional use of plants in the maintenance of health and the prevention of chronic and age-related diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Polo Botanico \"Hanbury\", Dip.
