In September 2022, anthracnose symptoms were found on this species in Nanning, Guangxi, China. The disease incidence was between 30% to 80% and disease severity was 10% to 30% in five surveyed planting areas. The symptoms initially appeared as small, round, brown spots on leaves. As the disease developed, the lesions turned gray-white with brown borders and yellow halos. Some spots coalesced into larger irregular shapes and even leading to leaf blight. Small segments of the diseased tissues (3\u00d73 mm) were cut from the leaves, surface-sterilized by dipping in a 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). These plates were incubated at 28\u00b0C in the dark for 5 days. Ten fungal isolates with similar morphology were consistently isolated from these diseased tissues. The colonies on PDA were initially white with sparse aerial mycelia and turned pale orange with abundant orange conidial masses on the center after 8 days of culture. The reverse color was pale orange. No sclerotia or setae were found in culture. Conidia were single-celled, hyaline, straight, cylindrical with round ends, and 12.2 to 17.8 \u00b5m long (mean 14.9 \u00b5m) and 3.9 to 7.3 \u00b5m wide (mean 4.8 \u00b5m, n=50). The morphological characteristics of these isolates were similar to the Colletotrichum cordylinicola (Sharma et al., 2014). Genomic DNA of two isolates Z3 and Z4 generated from monospore culture was extracted using a fungal DNA extraction kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Partial sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), partial actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) were amplified using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CHS-79F/CHS-345R, GDF1/GDR1, and BT2A/BT2B (Lin et al., 2022), respectively. All the sequences (GenBank accession nos. OQ509909, OQ509910, OQ658690, OQ658691, and OK649310 to OK649314) showed 99% to 100% identity with those of C. cordylinicola in GenBank database. A phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of ITS, ACT, CHS-1, TUB, and GAPDH using maximum likelihood analysis by MEGA X software revealed that Z3 and Z4 clade with reference strains of C. cordylinicola (OJX010226 and MK935473). Based on morphological observation and multi-gene sequence analysis, the isolates were identified as C. cordylinicola (Phoulivong et al., 2010). To assess their pathogenicity, conidial suspensions (106 conidia/ml) of C. cordylinicola were inoculated onto 10 healthy living leaves wounded by slight puncturing (10 \u03bcl/wounded spot). Control leaves were treated with sterile water. All inoculated and control plants were maintained under high relative humidity (~90%) and 28\u2103 in a climate chamber. After 8 days, all the inoculated leaves showed brown lesions resembling natural symptoms, whereas the control group remained symptom-free. The same fungus was re-isolated from the symptomatic leaves, thus completing Koch's postulates. C. cordylinicola is a species of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al., 2012). It has been reported to cause anthracnose on C. fruticosa in USA and Thailand (Phoulivong et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2014). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. cordylinicola causing anthracnose on C. fruticosa in China. Knowing the causal agent is essential to control the serious disease effectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, No.189, Changgang road, Nanning City,Guangxi, P.R.China, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530023; yeyunfeng111@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yunfeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanning Daxue East Road NO.174, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 78960987@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Chan Juan", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Science, 125388, Horticultural Research Institute, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 47885241@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Huayun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 174 East University Road, Xixiangtang District, Nanning,Guangxi, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530001; 1464596962@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Science, 125388, Horticultural Research Institute, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 375173440@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guifen", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 117866, Plant Protection Research Institute, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China; shbojiang@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shangbo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanning, China; 42610255@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Agricultural University, 34752, College of Plant Protection, Beijing, China; zhaomei@cau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Daxue RoadNanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; fug110@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38549275", "10.1094/PDIS-09-23-1915-PDN"]}}]}
