The lack of effective medications, and an approved vaccine, high toxicity and life-threatening side effects and many cases of drug resistance reported in different countries have resulted in the necessity to discover new, efficient, inexpensive, and safe antileishmanial compounds with less or no toxicity. This increase in consumer demand of natural herbal-derived plant extracts as alternative medicines continues despite the low scientific information to establish their efficacy and safety profiles. Various studies have been conducted so far concerning the application of herbal medicines for the treatment of leishmaniasis, but research on relatively effective and low toxic substances is still needed. In this review, we have summarized recent developments and reported studies concerning about herbal and naturally derived therapeutics in the treatment of leishmaniasis, conducted by several researchers worldwide. Some of these medical herbs with promising results have undergone prospective clinical researches, but many others have either not yet been explored. Recent articles described these medical herbs and their active and important molecules, including quinones, phenolic derivatives, lignans, tannins, terpenes, and oxylipins. We searched ISI Web of Science, PubMed, SID, Scholar, Scopus, and Science Direct, and articles published up to 2019 were included. The keywords of leishmaniasis and some words associated with herbal medicines and natural products were used in our search. This review can serve as a quick reference database for researchers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghodsian", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3312-7684"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Tissue engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.
