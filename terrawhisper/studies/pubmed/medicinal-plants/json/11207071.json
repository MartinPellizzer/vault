The efficacy of the two Siddha drugs, Aerva lanata and Vediuppu chunnam as antilithic agents using a urolithic rat model were tested in this study. Hyperoxaluria was induced in rats using 0.75% ethylene glycol in drinking water. Aerva lanata(3.0 mg kg(-1)body weight) and Vediuppu chunnam (3.5 mg kg(-1)body weight) were given orally for 28 days. Urinary risk factors of urolithiasis were monitored at the end of 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days. Urinary volume was increased in hyperoxaluric as well as drug-treated rats. Increased urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate, uric acid, phosphorus and protein in hyperoxaluric rats was brought down significantly by the administration of A. lanata or Vediuppu chunnam. Decreased magnesium excretion in hyperoxaluric rats was normalized by drug treatment. The drug increases the urine volume, thereby reducing the solubility product with respect to calcium oxalate and other crystallizing salts such as uric acid, which may induce epitaxial deposition of calcium oxalate. Drug alone treated rats did not show any adverse effects. Combination therapy was found to be more effective and this indigenous medicine can be used successfully as an antilithic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Dr Alm PG Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Madras, Taramani, Chennai, 600 021, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Selvam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kalaiselvi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Govindaraj", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bala Murugan", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sathish Kumar", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8907422", "ISSNLinking": "1043-6618"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2612HC57YE", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Oxalate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Oxalate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperoxaluria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Calculi"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11207071", "10.1006/phrs.2000.0745", "S1043-6618(00)90745-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
