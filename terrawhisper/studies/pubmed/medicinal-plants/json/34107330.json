Several Erycibe species are traditionally used in folk medicine for the treatment of various ailments, including rheumatic arthralgia, primary glaucoma, hepatopathies, and infectious and malignant diseases.", "This review aims to summarize comprehensive and updated information on traditional medicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Erycibe species to provide a reference for the further research and application of the Erycibe genus.", "The scientific and extensive literatures between 1975 and 2020 were systematically gathered from scientific databases such as SciFinder Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Springer Link and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), as well as Chinese herbal classic books, PhD and MSc theses, and several official websites.", "Erycibe species have been used for the treatment of various rheumatoid diseases, glaucoma, a variety of hepatic diseases, infectious diseases and various malignancies in the traditional and local medicine. Since the 1970s, 153 compounds, including coumarins, quinic acid derivatives, flavonoids, alkaloids, lignans, and others have been isolated from five species of the Erycibe genus. Pharmacological studies have shown that these extracts and compounds from the Erycibe genus have extensive activities consistent with the traditional and local applications, such as anti-glaucoma, anti-arthritic, hepatoprotective and anti-cancer activities, as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and neuroprotective properties.", "Although there are extensive data on the genus Erycibe, certain specific gaps still exist. For herbal preparations containing Erycibe species, clinical toxicological investigation is required for the safety of these herbal preparation therapies, as well as further investigations on pharmacokinetics and bioavailability for guideline for clinical application. Furthermore, more detailed pharmacological, toxicological and clinical researches are needed to assess the alternatives to Erycibe species. Systematic and comprehensive pre-clinical studies are similarly required to estimate the possibility of extracts and compounds from the genus Erycibe with bioactivity developing into new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
