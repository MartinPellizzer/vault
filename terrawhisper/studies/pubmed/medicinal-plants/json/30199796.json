Iris halophila Pall. is a salt-tolerant medicinal and ornamental plant, which has good application prospects in the ecological construction of saline-alkaline land; therefore, study of the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in I. halophila has important theoretical and practical value. To evaluate the molecular mechanism of the response of I. halophila to salt toxicity, I. halophila seedlings were treated with salt (300\u202fmM NaCl) and subjected to deep RNA sequencing. The clean reads were obtained and assembled into 297,188 unigenes. Among them, 1120 and 100 salt-responsive genes were identified in I. halophila shoots and roots, respectively. Among them, the key flavonoid and lignin biosynthetic genes, hormone signaling genes, sodium/potassium ion transporter genes, and transcription factors were analyzed and summarized. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis strengthened the reliability of the RNA sequencing results. This work provides an overview of the transcriptomic responses to salt toxicity in I. halophila and identifies the responsive genes that may contribute to its reduced salt toxicity. These results lay an important foundation for further study of the molecular mechanisms of salt tolerance in I. halophila and related species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
