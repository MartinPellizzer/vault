In this study, the spatial heterogeneity of soil physical and chemical properties, the diversity of rhizosphere soil microbial community structure, and the characteristics of growth of the wild and cultivated medicinal plant, Siberian fritillary (Fritillaria pallidiflora Schrek) were analyzed, and the soil quality and ecosystem sustainability were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that there was significant spatial variability of soil nutrients in the different habitats. Nitrate nitrogen (NO<sub>3</sub>-N) was strongly variable, while those of the soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (AP) were moderately variable. There was little variability among the soil available potassium (AK), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonium nitrogen (NH<sub>4</sub>-N). Inverse Distance Weighting spatial interpolation showed that SOC, NO<sub>3</sub>-N, NH<sub>4</sub>-H and EC were highly distributed in the southeastern part of the wild area, and the soil was more acidic in the original habitat than in the planting habitat. There was little AK and AP in the native habitat, and there was a high content in the planting habitat. Simultaneously, the soil microbial communities of the two soils also differed. The wild-type soil showed a \"fungal\" type, while the planted soil showed a \"bacterial\" type. Pathogenic bacteria were among the primary microflora in the planting area. In general, it is difficult to maintain the sustainable development and geo-herbalism of F. pallidiflora in today's cultivation mode because of the significant differences in soil nature, spatial heterogeneity and microbial community structure for the growth of F. pallidiflora. Therefore, future planting should focus on transforming it from intensive to mountain forest planting. This is highly significant for improving the planting efficiency of F. pallidiflora, protecting their geo-herbalism and germplasm resources, and maintaining the stability and sustainable development of the ecosystem."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
