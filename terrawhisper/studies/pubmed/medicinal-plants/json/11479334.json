Leaves were exposed to 250 and 500 nmol mol(-1) ozone at a photosynthetically active photon flux density of 300 micromol m(-2) s(-1) for 3 h. Images of fluorescence parameters indicated that large decreases in both the maximum and operating quantum efficiencies of photosystem II had occurred in cells adjacent to stomata in the upper, but not lower, leaf surfaces. However, this treatment did not produce any significant changes in the maximum or operating quantum efficiencies of photosystem II in the leaves when estimated from fluorescence parameters measured with a conventional, integrating fluorometer. The localized decreases in photosystem II photochemical efficiencies were accompanied by an increase in the minimal fluorescence level, which is indicative of photoinactivation of photosystem II complexes and a decrease in stomatal conductance. Perturbations of photochemical efficiencies were not observed in cells associated with all of the stomata on the upper leaf surface or within cells distant from the upper leaf surface. It is concluded that ozone penetrates the leaf through stomata and initially damages only cells close to stomatal pores."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Leipner", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oxborough", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Exp Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "9882906", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Diagnostic Imaging"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Theory"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11479334"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
