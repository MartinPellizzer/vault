Levels of plasma lipids, glucose and erythrocyte ATPases were monitored for one month. The dikanut supplement elicited hypolipidemic activity. The reduction in plasma lipids was primarily due to a decrease in LDL + VLDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels. HDL-cholesterol was increased. The three ATPases of the erythrocyte membrane of the diabetic patients were significantly lower than in normal subjects. When dikanut was consumed by the diabetics for four weeks, the activities of the enzymes increased significantly. The increases correlated well with significant reduction of plasma glucose levels. These desirable biochemical effects mediated by ingestion of a naturally-occurring dietary fibre were accompanied by improved clinical states."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Benin."}], "LastName": "Adamson", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okafor", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abu-Bakare", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "West Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8301891", "ISSNLinking": "0189-160X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2148494"]}}]}
