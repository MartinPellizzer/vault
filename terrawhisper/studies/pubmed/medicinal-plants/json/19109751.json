A mixture of coumarinolignoid A, B, and C at 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg body weight once a day for 14 consecutive days were administered orally to the mice. Pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide were estimated from culture supernatant obtained from peritoneal macrophages stimulated by LPS and anti-inflammatory mediator IL-4 was estimated from culture supernatant obtained from spleenocytes stimulated by Con-A. For further confirmation, expressions of inflammatory mediators from serum and mortality rate were studied in LPS-induced toxicity model in mice. The expression of Pro-inflammatory mediators was significantly (P <0.05) decreased in coumarinolignoids treatment group in dose dependent manner, whereas the anti-inflammatory mediator expression was significantly increased in coumarinolignoids at 10 mg/kg treatment. Mortality rate was also significantly reduced in treatment group in LPS-induced toxicity model. The result of this study concluded that the oral administration of coumarinolignoids inhibited the pro-inflammatory mediators and enhances the production of anti-inflammatory mediator in dose dependent manner."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Kukrail Picnic Spot Road, Lucknow 226015, India. du.bawankule@cimap.res.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bawankule", "ForeName": "D U", "Initials": "DU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chattopadhyay", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pal", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Faridi", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Darokar", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khanuja", "ForeName": "S P S", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Inflammopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "9112626", "ISSNLinking": "0925-4692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "207137-56-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cleome"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-4"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19109751", "10.1007/s10787-008-8012-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
