In-vitro study, anticancer against MCF7 and PC3 were assessed by the mitochondrial dependent reduction of yellow MTT. In in-vivo study against EAC progression, mice were inoculated with EAC cells and then were orally administered BAEPS at 200\u00a0mg/kg after 24\u00a0h (equals to 0.10 of determined LD<sub>50</sub>)/10\u00a0d.", "BAEPS was acidic exopolysaccharide contained uronic acid (12.3%) and sulfate (22.8%) with constitution of glucose, galactose and glucuronic acid in a molar ratio 1.6:1.0:0.9, respectively, with a molecular mass of 3.76\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>4</sup>\u00a0g/mol. BAEPS appeared potent antioxidant characters as free radical scavenging, oxygen reactive species scavenging and metal chelation, while its reducing power was low. BAEPS showed selective anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2 than COX-1, COX-2 selective. BAEPS exhibited potent and selective effect to breast cell cancer MCF7, the death percentage was 65.20% with IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and IC<sub>90</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0127.40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. BAEPS decreased counted viable EAC cells and induced non-viable cells. BAEPS improved all assessed hematological parameters. These improvements were reflected in the increasing median survival time and significant increment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in life span.", "BAEPS has anti-tumor activity with a good margin of safety. The anti-tumor activity of BAEPS may be due to its content from sulfated groups and uronic acids and they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
