Changes in pH, amino-nitrogen and protease activity were used as fermentation indicators. In comparison with the natural fermentation, changes in these process variables were more pronounced. Results also showed that the production time could be significantly reduced. In addition, the overall product quality of 'ugba' produced by the developed inocula was good and highly acceptable. The cultures were stable and viable for over 6 months on the granules of cowpea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbiology and Biotechnology Unit, School of Biological Sciences, College of Sciences, Abia State University, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isu", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ofuya", "ForeName": "C O", "Initials": "CO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8412849", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1605"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11020043", "10.1016/s0168-1605(00)00318-4", "S0168160500003184"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
