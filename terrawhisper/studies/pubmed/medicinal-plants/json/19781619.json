Recently, we have successfully purified an anticalcifying protein from the seeds of Trachyspermum ammi (L.)

The efficacy of TAP was studied in another group given same dose of EG and NH(4)Cl in addition to 2mg/kg body weight of TAP. Further, we evaluated ability of TAP to inhibit the attachment of calcium oxalate (CaO(x)) crystal in kidney tissue and studied the consequences of CaO(x) adhesion on renal functioning and tissue integrity.", "The antilithiatic potential of TAP was confirmed by its ability to maintain renal functioning, reduce renal injury and decrease crystal excretion in urine and retention in renal tissues.", "Thus, the present investigation suggests the potential of TAP in preventing calcium oxalate deposition and forms the basis for the development of antilithiatic drug interventions against urolithiasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Jaypee University of Information Technology, Waknaghat 173215, Solan, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaur", "ForeName": "Tanzeer", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bijarnia", "ForeName": "Rakesh K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singla", "ForeName": "Surinder K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tandon", "ForeName": "Chanderdeep", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "embryology"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Calcinosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urolithiasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19781619", "10.1016/j.jep.2009.09.015", "S0378-8741(09)00575-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
