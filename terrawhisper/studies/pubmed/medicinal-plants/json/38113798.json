(P. forrestii) in ameliorating the liver injury caused by fluoride ingestion and to explore the potential mechanisms. Initially, an in vitro fluorosis cell model was constructed using the human normal liver cell line (L-02) induced by fluoride. Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 assay kit. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay kit was utilized to measure LDH content in the cell supernatant, while the malonic dialdehyde (MDA) assay kit was employed to determine MDA levels within the cells. Subsequently, a fluorosis rat model was established, and LDH content in the cell supernatant was measured using the LDH assay kit. Various parameters, including MDA, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content within the cells, were detected using appropriate assay kits. Additionally, cell apoptosis rate was determined using the Annexin V-FITC/PI cell apoptosis assay kit. The protein expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Cleaved Caspase-9 were analyzed through Western blotting. Compared to the model group, the ethanolic fraction D of P.forrestii (Fr.D) increased cell viability (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and decreased LDH and MDA levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In the high-dose Fr.D treatment group of fluoride-poisoned rats, serum ALT, AST, LDH and MDA levels significantly decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Results from rat primary cells exhibited that the Fr.D administration group exhibited significantly higher cell survival rates than the fluoride group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Similarly, primary rat cells treated with Fr.D showed enhanced cell viability (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reduced apoptosis rate, LDH, MDA, SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and ROS levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared to the model group. Western blot analysis indicated that the Fr.D treatment group elevated the Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio and reduced Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 activation levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared to the model group. The results suggest that components within the Fr.D from Periploca forrestii may alleviate fluoride-induced liver injury by potentially counteracting oxidative stress and cell apoptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
