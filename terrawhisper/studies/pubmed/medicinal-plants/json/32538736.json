Paris Saponin VII (PS), a saponin which was isolated from the roots of Trillium kamtschaticum, from our group, was reported to provide hemostatic, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities. However, its molecular mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effects remains unclear. Thus, this study hypothesized to assess that mechanism in PS treated HEL cells.", "The MTT assay was used to analyze the PS inhibited cell viability in the HEL cells. We further found that PS could induce S phase cell cycle arrest through flow cytometry as well as the western blot analysis of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic molecules.", "The MTT assay showed the IC50 concentration of PS as 0.667\u03bcM. The study revealed that PS treatment inhibits cell proliferation dose-dependently. It further caused mitochondrial membrane potential changes by PS treatment. Mechanistic protein expression revealed a dose-dependent upsurge for Bid and Bim molecules, while Bcl2 and PARP expression levels were significantly (P<0.05) down-regulated in PS treated HEL cells resulting in caspase -3 release and increased the Bim levels upon 24h of incubation.", "These findings indicate that PS possesses an excellent anti-leukemic activity via the regulation of the mitochondrial pathway, leading to S phase cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis, suggesting it as a potential alternative chemotherapeutic agent for leukemia patients."],
