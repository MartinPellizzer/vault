These responses are essential act provided by the immune system during infection and tissue injury to maintain normal tissue homeostasis. Inflammation is a quite complicated process at molecular level with the involvement of several proinflammatory expressions. Several health problems are associated with prolonged inflammation, which effects nearly all major to minor diseases. The molecular and epidemiological studies jagged that the inflammation is closely associated with several disorders with their specific targets. It would be great achievement for human health around the world to overcome on inflammation. Mostly used anti-inflammatory drugs are at high risk of side effects and also expensive. Hence, the plant-based formulations gained a wide acceptance by the public and medical experts to treat it. Due to extensive dispersal, chemical diversity and systematically established biological potentials of natural products have induced renewed awareness as a gifted source for medications. However, today's urgent need to search for cheaper, more potent and safe anti-inflammatory medications to overcome on current situation. The goal of this review to compile an update on inflammation, associated diseases, molecular targets, inflammatory mediators and role of natural products. The entire text concise the involvement of various cytokines in pathogenesis of various human disorders. This assignment discussed about 321 natural products with their promising anti-inflammatory potential discovered during January 2009 to December 2018 with 262 citations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
