Medicinal plants offer promising avenues for natural diabetic management. <i>Galega officinalis</i> (goat's rue) has long been recognized for its hypoglycemic potential, but optimizing its phytochemical content and antidiabetic activity remains a key challenge. This study aimed to address this aspect by investigating the impact of foliar application of chitosan and salicylic acid on the physiological and phytochemical properties of <i>G.\u2009officinalis</i>, and subsequently evaluating its antidiabetic efficacy compared to that of the established drug metformin. A randomized complete block design with three replications was employed. Laboratory mice were divided into treatment groups receiving <i>G.\u2009officinalis</i> extract from plants sprayed with four salicylic acid concentrations (0.5-3\u2009mM/L) and four chitosan concentrations (0-0.8\u2009g/L). Blood glucose levels and various physiological parameters were assessed. Chitosan at 0.4\u2009g/L and salicylic acid at 2\u2009mM significantly enhanced the growth, photosynthetic pigments, and antioxidant activity of <i>G.\u2009officinalis</i>. Notably, the extract from plants treated with 3\u2009mM salicylic acid exhibited the highest total alkaloid content, a potential contributor to antidiabetic activity. In a separate study, diabetic mice treated with this optimized <i>G.\u2009officinalis</i> extract (50\u2009mg/kg) exhibited significantly greater blood glucose reductions compared to those treated with metformin (500\u2009mg). This study demonstrates the potential of chitosan and salicylic acid in optimizing the beneficial properties of <i>G.\u2009officinalis</i>. The extract derived from plants treated with 3\u2009mM salicylic acid displayed superior blood glucose-lowering efficacy compared to metformin, suggesting its promising role as a potential natural antidiabetic therapy. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific bioactive compounds responsible for this enhanced activity and translate these findings into clinical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
