The plant powder and marketed formulation were also subjected to stability studies. <i>Results:</i> The R<sub>f</sub> value of ASI was found in range of 0.43-0.47 for the standard ASI, plant powder, and marketed formulation. It was found that the plant powder and formulation exhibited first-order degradation kinetics. <i>Conclusions:</i> The contents of ASI in the formulation (<i>Churna)</i> and its flow characters reduced at the end of the 6 months during an accelerated stability study. The developed method can be used to quantify ASI in the presence of its degradation products. <i>Highlights:</i> The developed method helps in determining batch to batch variation in the content of ASI in herbal formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Charusat University, Ramanbhai Patel College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Analysis, Hwy 139, off Nadiad-Petlad Rd, Changa, India 388421."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Lisa J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Charusat University, Ramanbhai Patel College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Analysis, Hwy 139, off Nadiad-Petlad Rd, Changa, India 388421."}], "LastName": "Raval", "ForeName": "Manan A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Charusat University, Ramanbhai Patel College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Analysis, Hwy 139, off Nadiad-Petlad Rd, Changa, India 388421."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Samir G", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "K.B.
