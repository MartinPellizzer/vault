Antioxidant activity was analysed (antiradical activity, restoring force by FRAP method (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power), antioxidant activity in the system of linoleic acid), the content of total phenols and total flavonoids was determined. Along with this, vitamin C content, the total content of organic acids, reducing sugars, soluble substances were determined. <b>Results and discussion</b>. The results of this research indicated high biological activity of the rosehip test samples. Thus, the maximum content of total phenols was found in the following varieties: Samarskiy Yubileyniy (966 mg of gallic acid/100g of feedstock), Samarskiy (922 mg/100g), Desertniy (858 mg/100 g), Krupnoplodniy VNIVI (723 mg/ 100 g). High content of total flavonoids was determined in Desertnyi variety (442 mg of catechin/100g of feedstock) and Rosa spinosissima L. variety (418 mg/100 g). Anthocyan presence was observed only in Rosa spinosissima L. (90.86 mg cyanidin- 3-glycoside/100g of feedstock), as evidenced by its deep purple color. Desertnyi variety showed the highest indicator of antiradical activity (IC<sub>50</sub>=2.7 mg/\u0441m<sup>3</sup>) and restoring force (18.18 mol Fe<sup>2+</sup>/1 kg of feedstock). The ability to inhibit the oxidation of linoleic acid was demonstrated by all the given samples. For the rosehip the content of vitamin C (leading variety: Rosa mollis Sm. - 67.3 mg%, Krupnoplodniy VNIVI - 47.3 mg%), acidity (leading variety: Yubileyniy - 1.39%), mass fraction of reducing sugars (leading variety: Samarskiy - 9.9%), the content of soluble substances (leading variety: Desertniy - 22.2%) were determined. <b>Conclusion</b>. Hence, the given varieties of rosehip have a high antioxidant activity. According to this, it can be recommended for mass cultivation on the territory of Samara region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 GEOTAR-Media Publishing Group."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4527-8773"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Samara State Technical University, Samara, Russia."}], "LastName": "\u0410leksashina", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4282-5989"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Samara State Technical University, Samara, Russia."}], "LastName": "Makarova", "ForeName": "N V", "Initials": "NV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Horticulture and Medicinal Plants \u00abZhigulevskie Sady\u00bb (The Village of Experimental Station for Horticulture), Samara, Russia."}], "LastName": "Demenina", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Vopr Pitan", "NlmUniqueID": "2984870R", "ISSNLinking": "0042-8833"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "cyanidin-3-glycoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no overt and potential conflict of interest related to the publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31265779", "10.24411/0042-8833-2019-10033"]}}]}
