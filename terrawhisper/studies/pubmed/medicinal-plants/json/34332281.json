However, commercial TH and VH products are frequently adulterated with related inauthentic mistletoe species, posing efficacy and safety concerns. Accurate species identification of herbal medicinal products is a prerequisite for quality control, but traditional morphological identification methods are hampered by difficulties in discriminating among closely related species and in identifying the source materials in processed products.", "This study aimed to develop sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers and a multiplex-SCAR assay for rapid and accurate identification of authentic TH and VH.", "The matK region was sequenced in a total of 20 samples from five mistletoe species, namely T. chinensis and V. coloratum, and three species often found in adulterated herbal medicines, T. sutchuenensis, V. articulatum, and Macrosolen tricolor. Species-specific nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and short regions (21-22 bp) containing at least two species-specific nucleotides close to the 3' end were incorporated into SCAR primers that produced uniquely sized PCR amplicons for each species. The five SCAR primer sets were also combined into a multiplex-SCAR assay.", "The SCAR primers successfully generated amplicons of the expected size for each target species even with low-DNA templates or with templates containing DNA from multiple samples. No amplification was observed in non-target species. The SCAR markers and the multiplex-SCAR assay successfully identified commercial TH and VH products that were counterfeit or adulterated in both dried and processed products.", "This is the first report to illustrate discrimination of genuine medicinal mistletoe species with DNA-based marker assays, enabling rapid and accurate species identification. The SCAR assays developed in this study will facilitate the standardization of commercial mistletoe products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
