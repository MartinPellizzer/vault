The nutritional, physical and acceptability characteristics of the blends were investigated. The products were found to be superior to the customarily eaten Nigerian abari (maize meal) in terms of protein content and digestibility. With increasing level of soyflour supplementation of the maize flour, the overall balance of amino acid, available lysine, protein digestibility, total ash as well as energy density increased. Also firmer, smoother, lighter and more yellowish and attractive products were obtained as a result of supplementation. The blend produced at 30% level of supplementation was assessed similar in texture to cowpea moin-moin (cowpea meal). All blends were equally acceptable as the control abari but the blend produced from 40% soyflour supplementation was judged more similar in most characteristics to cowpea moin-moin. Blends A3 and A4 (30 and 40% level of soyflour supplementation respectively) are recommended for adoption based on its protein quality, physical and acceptability characteristics. The two formulations are suitable for combating protein malnutrition in a predominantly starch and cereal based diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences, King's College London, UK."}], "LastName": "Omueti", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morton", "ForeName": "I O", "Initials": "IO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8889621", "10.3109/09637489609006949"]}}]}
