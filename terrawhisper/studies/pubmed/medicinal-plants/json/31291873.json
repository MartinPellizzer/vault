The disease is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and induction of oxidative stress. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive ingredient of marijuana that has been reported to be safe and well tolerated in patients. Due to its pleiotropic effect, CBD has been shown to exert cytoprotective effects. This study intended to clarify the mechanisms and the potential role of CBD regarding cardiac injuries treatment.", "A systematic literature search was conducted, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, in the electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase up to June 2019 using predefined search terms in the titles and abstracts.
