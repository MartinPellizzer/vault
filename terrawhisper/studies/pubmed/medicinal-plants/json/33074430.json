Indoor plants can phytoremediate a wide variety of indoor contaminants. Nonetheless, few experiments have demonstrated their efficacy in real-time environments. Therefore, the present study aims to experimentally assess the efficiency of Areca palm potted plants in phytoremediation of primary indoor air pollutant viz. total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) levels from real-world indoor spaces, for the first time. Four discrete naturally ventilated experimental sites (I-IV) situated at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT) were used. For over a period of 4\u00a0months, the sites were monitored using zero plants as a control (1-4\u00a0week), three plants (5-8\u00a0week), six plants (9-12\u00a0week), and nine plants (13-16\u00a0week), respectively. Present results indicate that Areca palm potted plants can effectively reduce the TVOCs, CO<sub>2</sub>, and CO levels by 88.16% in site IV, 52.33% and 95.70% in site III, respectively. The current study concluded that Areca palm potted plants offer an efficient, cost-effective, self-regulating, sustainable solution for improving indoor air quality and thereby human well-being and productivity in closed and confined spaces."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8698-3607"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Floriculture Laboratory, Agrotechnology of Medicinal, Aromatic and Commercially Important Plants Division, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, P.O.
