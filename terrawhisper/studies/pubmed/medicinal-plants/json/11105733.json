The Physicians' Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines was also consulted.", "Although many of the herbal agents said to have benefits in depression appear to be safe, serious neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions have been reported for several over-the-counter \"antidepressants.\" There is reason to suspect underreporting of those adverse events. Moreover, there is very little evidence from systematic studies regarding the potential for drug-drug or herb-drug interactions with these over-the-counter agents. Vitamins and amino acids touted for the treatment of depression are also not without risk.", "Although some over-the-counter remedies for depression are probably safe and effective for as-yet unidentified subgroups of depressed individuals, more research is required before these agents can be recommended for routine use. Stricter U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight of these agents is indicated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Mass, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pies", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "7801243", "ISSNLinking": "0160-6689"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "459AG36T1B", "NameOfSubstance": "Dehydroepiandrosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4L6452S749", "NameOfSubstance": "Inositol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7LP2MPO46S", "NameOfSubstance": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dehydroepiandrosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Information Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Inositol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Psychoses, Substance-Induced"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}], "NumberOfReferences": "41"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11105733", "10.4088/jcp.v61n1102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
