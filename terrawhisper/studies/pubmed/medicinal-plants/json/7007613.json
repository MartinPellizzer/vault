However, the marked increase of hydrophilicity caused by substitution of trimethoxy groups conspicuously decreased the inhibitory potency. Methylation at alpha-position of the hydroxamic acid group in these compounds remarkably decreased the inhibitory potency, probably owing to steric hindrance by the alpha-methyl group. Thenoyl-, furoyl- and nicotino-glycinohydroxamic acids which are bioisostereomers of hippurohydroxamic acid had I50 values of 0.64, 1.3 and 5.3 microM, respectively. Furthermore, the inhibitory potency of some substituted hippurohydroxamic acids against the ureolytic activity of intact Proteus mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infection, were half to one-tenth of those against urease activity of sword bean. On the other hand, m- and p-nitro-, m- and p-methoxy-, m- and p-acetylamino-hippurohydroxamic acid and furoylglycinohydroxamic acid showed high urinary excretion rates of 14 to 16% of the doses administered orally to rats, while most of the others had excretion rates of about 3 to 5%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Munakata", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takebe", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hase", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Proteus mirabilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Calculi"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7007613", "10.1248/bpb1978.3.444"]}}]}
