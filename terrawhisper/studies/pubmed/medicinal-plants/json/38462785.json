Thirty male and female Wistar rats were used to study the cutaneous toxicity of extracts from the bark of <i>P. halepensis</i>. The extracts' healing potential for burn wounds were also assessed by evaluating the clinical and macroscopic aspects of the wounds. The antibacterial activity of crude extracts of <i>P. halepensis</i> as well as its wound healing abilities was verified in this investigation.", "In animals with acute dermal toxicity, there were no signs of treatment-related toxicity or death. The extracts of these plants could be transformed into phytomedicines for the treatment of infected wounds. The results demonstrated that formulated ointments are successful in treating second-degree burns in rats and may be suitable for the short-term therapeutic treatment of second-degree burns.", "This study successfully answered our problem, regarding the efficacy of our extract for treating second-degree burns in rats. Further studies are needed to confirm these results by identifying the molecules responsible for these activities and examining their mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
