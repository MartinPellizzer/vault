The present investigation was undertaken to confirm its claimed activity in traditional medicine. The ethanol extract of the plant was tested on laboratory animals for its antipyretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, purgative and muscle relaxant activities. The results of this study showed a significant antipyretic, analgesic and neuromuscular blocking activity. On smooth muscle of guinea pig ileum, the extract produced contractions which was blocked by atropine supporting its use in constipation. The extract failed to produce significant anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. Our phytochemical studies on the aerial parts of C. procera showed the presence of alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, sterols and/or triterpenes. However, the chemical constituents responsible for the pharmacological activities remains to be investigated. The safety evaluation studies revealed that the use of extract in single high doses (up to 3 g/kg) does not produce any visible toxic symptoms or mortality. However, prolong treatment (90 days) causes significantly higher mortality as compared to control group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mossa", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mohsin", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ageel", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "al-Yahya", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "al-Said", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rafatullah", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pain Management"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1767794", "10.1142/S0192415X91000302", "S0192415X91000302"]}}]}
