So far, donepezil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved dual-binding site inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that can amplify the cholinergic activity and also decrease A\u03b2 aggregation in Alzheimer patients. We report herein a new donepezil-like natural compound derivative (D1) as a convincing AChE inhibitor. The <i>in silico</i> studies suggests that D1 exhibits a dual-binding mode of action and interacts with both the catalytic anionic site and peripheral anionic site (PAS) of human AChE. The biological studies confirm the dual-binding site character of D1 and revealed that D1 not only enhances the acetylcholine levels but also reduces the accumulation of A\u03b2 plaques in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. In fact, 5 \u03bcM D1 was seen more potent in elevating the acetylcholine expression than 25 \u03bcM donepezil. While most of the non-cholinergic functions of donepezil, associated with the PAS of AChE, were gradually lost at higher concentrations, D1 was more functional at similar doses. Promisingly, D1 also exerted an agonistic effect on the \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discovery Informatics Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}], "LastName": "Akhoon", "ForeName": "Bashir Akhlaq", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of PK-PD-Toxicology and Formulation Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "Sushil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discovery Informatics Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Harshita", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of PK-PD-Toxicology and Formulation Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discovery Informatics Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Barik", "ForeName": "Manas Ranjan", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Technology and Nematology Department, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Rathor", "ForeName": "Laxmi", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microbial Technology and Nematology Department, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3561-219X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Discovery Informatics Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Canal Road, Jammu 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Nargotra", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Inf Model", "NlmUniqueID": "101230060", "ISSNLinking": "1549-9596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8SSC91326P", "NameOfSubstance": "Donepezil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Donepezil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32955256", "10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00496"]}}]}
