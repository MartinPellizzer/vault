Most models postulate that the statoliths interact with microfilaments (MF) to transmit signals to the plasma membrane (or ER), or that sedimentation onto these organelles produces the signals. However, no direct evidence for statolith-MF links has been reported, and no asymmetric structures of columella cells have been identified that might explain how a root turned by 90 degrees knows which side is up. To address these and other questions, we have (1) quantitatively examined the effects of microgravity on the size, number, and spatial distribution of statoliths; (2) re-evaluated the ultrastructure of columella cells in high-pressure frozen/freeze-substituted roots; and (3) followed the sedimentation dynamics of statolith movements in reoriented root tips. The findings have led to the formulation of a new model for the gravity-sensing apparatus of roots, which envisages the cytoplasm pervaded by an actin-based cytoskeletal network. This network is denser in the ER-devoid central region of the cell than in the ER-rich cell cortex and is coupled to receptors in the plasma membrane. Statolith sedimentation is postulated to disrupt the network and its links to receptors in some regions of the cell cortex, while allowing them to reform in other regions and thereby produce a directional signal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA. staeheli@colorado.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Staehelin", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "H Q", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoder", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Todd", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Gravit Space Biol Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9816128", "ISSNLinking": "1089-988X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravity Sensing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plastids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rotation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11543286"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
