To achieve this goal, it proved to be necessary to devise a strategy that would enable chemical transformations to install an epoxy moiety in a congested environment. The successful preparation of a hindered epoxide from O-isopropylidene-protected 4-aminocyclohexenol required three steps consisting principally of controlled bromohydration and base-promoted closure and N-alkylation. It was found that a catalytic amount of SnCl(4) not only maintained the catalytic cycle but also effected clean arylation to form a fused BC ring system. Several tactics that ultimately proved to be unsatisfactory are also discussed in an effort to set important boundary limits on arene-epoxide coupling. The requisite enantiopure 4-aminocyclohexenol was available via an asymmetric cycloaddition of diene to camphor-based chloronitroso. The total synthesis of (+)-narciclasine was realized in nine steps with an overall yield of 19%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elango", "ForeName": "Shanmugham", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Tu-Hsin", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tin Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1BQV3749L5", "NameOfSubstance": "stannous chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29477-83-6", "NameOfSubstance": "narciclasine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Narcissus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tin Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12353988", "10.1021/jo020155k", "jo020155k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
