Autophagy is a cellular self-catabolism process, which is critical to protect cellular homeostasis against harmful conditions. Emerging evidence suggest that dysregulated autophagy is involved in the development of AS. Therefore, pharmacological interventions have been developed to inhibit the AS via autophagy induction. Among various AS treating methods, herbal medicines and natural products have been applied as effective complementary and alternative medicines to ameliorate AS and its associated cardiovascular disease. Recently, mounting evidence revealed that natural bioactive compounds from herbs and natural products could induce autophagy to suppress the occurrence and development of AS, by promoting cholesterol efflux, reducing plaque inflammation, and inhibiting apoptosis or senescence. In the present review, we highlight recent findings regarding possible effects and molecular mechanism of natural compounds in autophagy-targeted mitigation of atherosclerosis, aiming to provide new potential therapeutic strategies for the atherosclerosis treatment preclinically and clinically."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
