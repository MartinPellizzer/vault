(Boraginaceae) was the first plant secondary metabolite produced in industrial scale from plant cell cultures. We have now manipulated the biosynthetic pathway leading to shikonin in L. erythrorhizon by introduction of the bacterial gene ubiA. This gene of Escherichia coli encodes 4-hydroxybenzoate-3-polyprenyltransferase, a membrane-bound enzyme that catalyzes a key step in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Using geranyl diphosphate (GPP) as substrate, it is able to catalyze the formation of 3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate (GBA), a principal step of shikonin biosynthesis. The prokaryotic ubiA gene was fused to two signal sequences for targeting of the resulting peptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Constructs with different constitutive promoters were introduced into L. erythrorhizon using Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. In the resulting hairy root lines, high UbiA enzyme activities could be observed, reaching 133 pkat mg(-1). Expression of ubiA resulted in an accumulation of GBA in an amount exceeding that of the control culture by a factor of 50. However, the ubiA-transformed lines showed only a marginal (average 22%) increase of shikonin production in comparison to the control lines, and there was no significant correlation of UbiA enzyme activity and shikonin accumulation. This suggests that overexpression of ubiA alone is not sufficient to increase shikonin formation, and that further enzymes are involved in the regulation of this pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmazeutisches Institut, Pharmazeutische Biologie, Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boehm", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sommer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heide", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IK6592UBW", "NameOfSubstance": "shikonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11038051", "10.1093/pcp/pcd013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
