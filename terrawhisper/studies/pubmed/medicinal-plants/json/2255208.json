A significant negative correlation with snail numbers was found for distance of T. tetraptera from transmission sites and fruiting of the trees when these variables were tested individually. There were no significant differences between individual variables such as pH, Ca2+ concentrations and temperatures for these snail habitats but these variables produced significant positive correlation with the number of snails recovered. Thus, the presence of T. tetraptera appeared to be the most important limiting factor for the presence of snails. Aqueous extracts of T. tetraptera were effective as a molluscicide against Bulinus globosus and Lymnaea natalensis. However, pollution of the environment by oils reduced or abolished the molluscicidal activity of T. tetraptera. The results indicate that the planting of T. tetraptera has potential for the local control of schistosomiasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Research and Production Unit, Faculty of Pharmacy, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adewunmi", "ForeName": "C O", "Initials": "CO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Furu", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Marquis", "ForeName": "B B", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fagbola", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Olatunji", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bulinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Fascioliasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymnaea"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "transmission"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Snails"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2255208", "10.1016/0378-8741(90)90006-f", "0378-8741(90)90006-F"]}}]}
