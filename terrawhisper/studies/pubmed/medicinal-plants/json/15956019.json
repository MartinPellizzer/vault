Osthole (7-methoxy-8-isopentenoxycoumarin) is a coumarin derivative present in many medicinal plants. By means of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and type I collagen, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we have shown that osthole exhibits a significant induction of differentiation in two human osteoblast-like cell lines, MG-63 and hFOB. Induction of differentiation by osthole was associated with increased bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 production and the activations of SMAD1/5/8 and p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinases. Addition of purified BMP-2 protein did not increase the up-regulation of ALP activity and osteocalcin by osthole, whereas the BMP-2 antagonist noggin blocked both osthole and BMP-2-mediated ALP activity enhancement, indicating that BMP-2 production is required in osthole-mediated osteoblast maturation. Pretreatment of osteoblast cells with noggin abrogated p38 activation but only partially decreased ERK1/2 activation, suggesting that BMP-2 signaling is required in p38 activation and is partially involved in ERK1/2 activation in osthole-treated osteoblast cells. Cotreatment of p38 inhibitor SB203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole] or p38 small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression inhibited osthole-mediated activation of ALP but only slightly affected osteocalcin production. In contrast, the production of osteocalcin induced by osthole was inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) or by expression of an ERK2 siRNA. These data suggest that BMP-2/p38 pathway links to the early phase, whereas ERK1/2 pathway is associated with the later phase in osthole-mediated differentiation of osteoblast cells. In this study, we demonstrate that osthole is a promising agent for treating osteoporosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Chia-Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan, Taiwan. kuopolin@seed.net.tw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuo", "ForeName": "Po-Lin", "Initials": "PL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsu", "ForeName": "Ya-Ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hsiung", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Jiunn-Kae", "Initials": "JK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "BMP2 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "SMAD1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smad Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Smad1 Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trans-Activators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XH1TI1759C", "NameOfSubstance": "osthol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "DNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Signaling System"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smad Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smad1 Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trans-Activators"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15956019", "10.1124/jpet.105.085092", "jpet.105.085092"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
