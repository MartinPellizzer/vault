In the absence of an analytical method for the differentiation and analysis of these two species, TLC and HPLC-MS methods have been developed for this purpose. Both species could be readily distinguished by their flavonoid pattern as revealed by TLC on silica gel layers eluted with ethyl acetate:formic acid:acetic acid:water. The quantitative determination of four flavonoids, namely hispidulin-7-neohesperidoside, linarin, pectolinarin and luteolin, was possible using HPLC. Their optimum separation was achieved on a C12 column eluted with water and 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. HPLC-MS experiments were performed to confirm peak identity. In samples of C. japonicum, pectolinarin was the major flavonoid (0.32-2.00%), followed by linarin, hispidulin-7-neohesperidoside and luteolin; the total flavonoid content varied from 0.81 to 3.67%. In C. setosum only one flavonoid (linarin; 1.36-2.83%) was assignable. The HPLC method was validated for linearity, limit of detection (< or = 1.7 ng on-column), peak purity, repeatability (< or = 2.3%) and accuracy (recovery rates of spiked samples were between 99.2 and 101.6%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Institute of Pharmacy, University of Innsbruck, Innrain 52, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.
