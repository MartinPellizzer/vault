An additional peroxide bridge in compound 3 led to the construction of an unexpected 7,8-dioxatricyclo[4.2.2.0<sup>2,5</sup>]decene scaffold. The structures of 1-3 were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic techniques, and their absolute configurations were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses and ECD calculations.
