Culture conditions have been established for the cell suspension of the different callus cell lines. Callus were induced from Taxus baccata and Taxus x Media using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of 2,4 D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic) and benzylaminopurine (BA). All the cultures grew slowly following the first subculture and the majority turned brown and ceased growth. The fast growing callus lines constituted a habituated callus lines (CFGTB; CFGTM; CSTB and CSTB). These callus lines were used to induce cell suspension in the best nutritional medium (1 mg/l 2,4-D and 0.1 mg/l BA). The callus exhibited levels of taxol ranging from 0.1 to 15 mg/Kg on a dry weight basis. Suspension cultures of Taxus baccata (CSTB and CFGTB) and Taxus x Media (CSTM and CFGTM) were maintained at 25 degrees C on a MS medium with two weeks transfers. The maximum taxol production for suspension cell was within the range 5 to 6 mg/l."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Biotecnolog\u00eda Vegetal, Fac. de Ciencias Agropecuarias, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina. goleniow@ceprocor.uncor.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goleniowski", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biocell", "NlmUniqueID": "9438655", "ISSNLinking": "0327-9545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10979612"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
