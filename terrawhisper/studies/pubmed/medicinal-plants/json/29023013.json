Chemotherapy is the main method of breast cancer treatment but there are side effects. Carica papaya leaves is vegetable foods consumed by most people of Indonesia have potential as anticancer. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-proliferative and apoptotic induced effect of aqueous papaya leaves extracts on human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7.", "Inhibitory on cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay while apoptosis induction was measured using Annexin V.", "The results showed that papaya leaf can inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cells MCF-7 with IC50 in 1319.25 \u03bcg mL-1. The IC50 values of papaya leaf extract was higher than the IC50 value quercetin and doxorubicin. Papaya leaf extract can also induce apoptosis of breast cancer cells MCF-7 about 22.54% for concentration 659.63 \u03bcg mL-1 and about 20.73% for concentration 329.81 \u03bcg mL-1. The percentage of cell apoptosis of papaya leaf extract lower than doxorubicin but higher than quercetin.", "This study indicated that papaya leaf extract have potential as anticancer through mechanism anti-proliferation and apoptosis induction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jl Farmako Sekip Utara, 55281 Yogyakarta, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Zuhrotun Nisa", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jl Flora No. 1, 55281 Yogyakarta, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Astuti", "ForeName": "Mary", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jl Flora No. 1, 55281 Yogyakarta, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Murdiati", "ForeName": "Agnes", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jl Farmako Sekip Utara, 55281 Yogyakarta, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Mubarika Haryana", "ForeName": "Sofia", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carica"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29023013", "10.3923/pjbs.2017.36.41"]}}]}
