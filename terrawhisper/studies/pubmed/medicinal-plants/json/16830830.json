The growth rate constants of promotive and inhibitory actions were calculated. Moreover, the potential pharmacological action of FII was analyzed from the point of view of TCM theory.", "The growth rate constant k1 and Pm of the studied bacterium in the presence of the decoction of FII were concentration-dependant. The k1 and Pm increased with the mass increase of the decoction and its water-extract of FII. However, the value of k1 and Pm decreased with the increasing concentrations of its other four organic solvent parts. The experimental results revealed that the sequence of inhibitory activity of different extracts was n-BuOH extract > EtOAc extract > chloroform extract > PE extract.", "The decoction and its water-extract of FII stimulated the metabolism of E. coli. While the other four organic solvent extracts of the total decoction inhibited the growth of tested bacterium. The microcalorimetric method has many virtues such as extensive applicability, convenience, etc, and provides a new and useful means for primary screening the bioactive parts and substances of TCM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine, 302 Hospital of PLA, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yan-wen", "Initials": "YW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Xiao-he", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wen-yuan", "Initials": "WY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yan-ling", "Initials": "YL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Isatis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16830830"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
