The animals were grouped at random into four experimental groups (oral administration of garlic, NTP, BP or mineral oil followed by DMBA painting on buccal pouches), three chemical control groups (oral administration of garlic, NTP or BP without DMBA painting) and a DMBA control group (only painted DMBA on buccal pouches). Starting from the fourth week after DMBA painting, the pouch mucosae were examined biweekly for its tumor formation and blood vessel architecture. Animals were sacrificed 25 weeks after DMBA application. Tumors and pouch mucosae were dissected to examine tumor nature and biochemical reactions of DNA synthesis and GGTase activity. The inhibitory efficacy of garlic, BP and NTP were evaluated according to the results of these examinations. Garlic was found to have a higher inhibitory efficacy than BP and NTP through the probable mechanism of competitive binding with nuclear DNA and diminishing the opportunity of DMBA to initiate carcinogenesis. Other factors related to cancer inhibition included insufficient local blood flow, low GGTase activity and lesser DNA synthesis. The inhibitory effect of fractions of garlic on experimental carcinogenesis should be a reasonable and necessary continuation in future studies of the series of cancer prevention by garlic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shyu", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3112823"]}}]}
