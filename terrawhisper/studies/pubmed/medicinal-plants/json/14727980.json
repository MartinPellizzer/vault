The incorporation of effective CAM therapies into traditional practice is termed 'integrative medicine'. One form of CAM demonstrating exponential growth through mass public consumerism is the use of naturoceuticals. Naturoceutical (or nutraceutical) agents are defined as mega-dose vitamins, herbal products or other 'natural' supplements purchased and consumed with premeditated 'pharmaceutical' intention to treat or prevent an illness or disease. Dietary supplements per se, are intended to supply adequate nutrients that may be lacking from the diet, and are thus, generally health promoting. A regulatory paradox exists since naturoceuticals are classified as dietary supplements although many possess measurable pharmacologic activity. In reference to cardiovascular disorders, consumers use naturoceuticals for three distinctly recognizable purposes. These are the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and the treatment of diagnosed disorders such as heart failure, angina pectoris or arrhythmia. The evidence base supporting the routine use of naturoceutical products for these intentions is sparse, although the likelihood of harm from their consumption is low for an average, healthy adult. Evidence of significant harm (including fatalities) has been observed when certain herbal products are used in excess or in combination with, other herbs or prescription drugs. The safety of use at the extremes of age, or by persons with cardiac, renal or hepatic impairment is also a concern. Healthcare professionals should routinely document patient naturoceutical use, be alert for and report suspected adverse effects. Until well-designed clinical trials determine the proper indication(s), dose safety profile and risk/benefit ratio for these products, their routine use should not be advocated. Thus, the role of naturoceutical agents in the integrative management of cardiovascular disorders remains undefined."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Program, University of California at San Diego Medical Center, UCSD Healthcare, San Diego, California 92103-8411, USA. dhermann@ucsd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hermann", "ForeName": "Denise D", "Initials": "DD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "New Zealand", "MedlineTA": "Am J Cardiovasc Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "100967755", "ISSNLinking": "1175-3277"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Naturopathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Practice Guidelines as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Product Surveillance, Postmarketing"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}], "NumberOfReferences": "195"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14727980", "10.2165/00129784-200202030-00005", "020305"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
