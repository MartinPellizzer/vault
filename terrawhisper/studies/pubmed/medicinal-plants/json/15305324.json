To determine the relationships between the hazard for death and that for cure, a cure--death hazard plot was developed. The daily ratios of the two hazards determine the ultimate case fatality rate. The case fatality rate was approximately 18% for Hong Kong and Singapore, while the rate for Beijing exceeded 52% until 5 May, was 16% for 5-19 May, and 4%-1% after 20 May. These results show a significant difference in the case fatality rate between Beijing and other areas, which seems to have been due to the difference in treatment methods. That is, it suggests that combining traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine is useful in the treatment of SARS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biosciences, Graduate School of Environmental Studies, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan. chenzheng1978@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Tsuyoshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hong Kong"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["mortality", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Singapore"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15305324", "10.1002/ptr.1485"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
