Germination was performed under conditions commonly used in the household. The amount of water taken up during 4 days of germination varied from 159 g/100 g (chickpeas) to 450 g/100 g (mung beans). For all three seeds losses of dry matter and carbohydrates were observed. In wheat and mung beans, phytic acid was partially hydrolyzed. In mung beans, the total fat content decreased. Increases in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in wheat and of dietary fibre in wheat and mung beans were noted. At a constant level of crude protein, a measurable rise in limiting amino acids was observed in wheat and mung beans. Frequent watering during germination caused losses of Fe, between 9% and 21%, K (27% in chickpeas) and Cu (17% in chickpeas). Except for vitamin B6 in both legumes and vitamin B1 in chickpeas, accumulation of the vitamins under investigation (B1, B2, B6, C, E) was noted. Owing to these changes during germination, the nutritional value of the three seeds has been improved to various extents, most distinctly in wheat and least noticeably in chickpeas. Compared with other vegetables, sprouted seeds can be considered a valuable addition to the diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bundesforschungsanstalt f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung, Karlsruhe, Bundesrepublik Deutschland."}], "LastName": "Harmuth-Hoene", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bognar", "ForeName": "A E", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kornemann", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diehl", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Der Einfluss der Keimung auf den N\u00e4hrwert von Weizen, Mungbohnen und Kichererbsen."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Lebensm Unters Forsch", "NlmUniqueID": "7509812", "ISSNLinking": "0044-3026"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3433953", "10.1007/BF01042260"]}}]}
