In this experiment,ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry( UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to establish an analytical method for simultaneous determination of chlorogenic acid,gardenioside,oroxylin A and baicalin in rat plasma. Then,the non-compartmental model( NCA) in Phoenix WinN onL in 6. 4 software was used to fit pharmacokinetic parameters. The methodological validation showed that the linear relationship of the components in rat plasma samples were good( r&gt;0. 995). The recovery rate and matrix effect of plasma samples with low,middle and high concentration were 79. 14%-101. 4%. The intra-day and inter-day precision,accuracy and stability meet the requirements of biological sample analysis. The half-life( t1/2) of chlorogenic acid,gardenioside,oroxylin A did not change significantly and the area under blood concentration-time curve( AUC0-t) is proportional to the dose,which suggested that three components showed a linear kinetic characteristics,but baicalin showed nonlinear kinetic characteristics. Moreover,the retention time of each component in rats was short. The established UPLC-MS/MS quantitative analysis method is rapid,sensitive and accurate,which can be used for the determination of chlorogenic acid,gardenioside,oroxylin A and baicalin in rat plasma and pharmacokinetic study of Shuganning Injection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Ning-Fang", "Initials": "NF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "He-Jia", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Hong-Qin", "Initials": "HQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li-Qin", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue-Ting", "Initials": "YT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ai-Min", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Ruihe Pharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.
