Additionally, previously unpublished work on the traditional uses of P. umbellatum from our National Study of the Medicinal Plants of the Dominican Republic has been included.", "Piper umbellatum is a Neotropical plant species widely distributed in Mexico, Central America, South America and the West Indian Islands. It has also been introduced to Africa and South-East Asia. Traditional uses for this plant are recorded in 24 countries in three continents, America, Africa and Asia for a wide range of ailments such as kidney, women diseases, diarrhea, skin affections, burns, rheumatism, malaria, intestinal parasites, inflammation and fever. We have analyzed the cross-cultural agreement among traditional uses in different countries and found a high degree of consensus for the indications kidney/diuretic, stomachache and wounds. Phytochemical studies of P. umbellatum have demonstrated the presence of terpenes (mainly found in the essential oil), alkaloids, flavonoids, sterols and other classes of secondary metabolites. The extracts and pure compounds derived from P. umbellatum show a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimalarial, antileishmanial, and antitrypanosomal activity. A first commercial product is in development, based on the plant's protective characteristics against UV irradiation.", "The interesting biological activities of P. umbellatum need further research in in vivo experiments and clinical studies. The outcome of these investigations will determine the possible development of drugs from P. umbellatum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
