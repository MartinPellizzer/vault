In this study, the inhibitory activity of four spices/herbs and their mixtures on HCAs formation in grilled beef were examined. A simplex centroid mixture design with four components comprising turmeric, curry leaf, torch ginger and lemon grass in 19 different proportions were applied on beef samples before grilling at 240 \u00baC for 10\u00a0min. The HCAs were extracted from the samples using solid phase extraction (SPE) method and analysed using Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS. All spices/herbs in single or mixture forms were found to reduce total HCA concentrations in marinated grilled beef ranging from 21.2% for beef marinated with curry leaf to 94.7% for the combination of turmeric and lemon grass (50:50\u00a0w/w). At the optimum marinade formula (turmeric: lemon grass 52.4%: 47.6%), concentration of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinolone (IQ), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), Harman, Norharman and A\u03b1C were 2.2, 1.4, 0.5, 2.8 and 1.2 ng/g, respectively. The results of the mutagenic activity demonstrated that this optimised marinade formula significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) diminished mutagenicity of marinated grilled beef in bacterial Ames test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Science and Technology , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Sepahpour", "ForeName": "Shabnam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Science and Technology , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Food Safety and Food Integrity (FOSFI), Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Food Security , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Selamat", "ForeName": "Jinap", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , International Islamic Universiti Malaysia , Kuantan , Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Khatib", "ForeName": "Alfi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Food Science and Technology , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Manap", "ForeName": "Mohd Yazid Abdul", "Initials": "MYA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Science and Technology , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Food Safety and Food Integrity (FOSFI), Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Food Security , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Bioscience , Universiti Putra Malaysia , Serdang , Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Abdull Razis", "ForeName": "Ahmad Faizal", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e National Food Institute , Technical University of Denmark , Denmark."}], "LastName": "Hajeb", "ForeName": "Parvaneh", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Red Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29913103", "10.1080/19440049.2018.1488085"]}}]}
