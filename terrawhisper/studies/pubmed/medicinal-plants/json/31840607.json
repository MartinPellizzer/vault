There are credible documentations that demonstrate Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) acts as IBD regulator. Upon the activation of MAPK signalling pathway, the transcription and expression of various encoding inflammatory molecules implicated in IBD are altered, thereby exacerbating the inflammation development. The current pharmacological management of IBD, including drug and biological therapies are expensive, possess temporary relief and some adverse effects. In this context, a variety of dietary fruits or medicinal herbs have received worldwide attention versus the development of IBD. Infact, natural ingredients, such as Flavaglines, Fisetin, Myricitrin, Cardamonin, Curcumin, Octacosanol and Mangiferin possess protective and therapeutic effects against IBD via modulation of different segments of MAPK signaling pathway. This review paper calls attention to the role of MAPK signaling triggered by natural products in the prevention and treatment of IBD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine Department, Imam Reza Hospital, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran"}], "LastName": "Zobeiri", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group (TDG), Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center (PSRC), The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (TIPS), and Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Pharmacology Interest Group (GPIG), Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran, Iran"}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran"}], "LastName": "Parvizi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab 144 411, India"}], "LastName": "Tewari", "ForeName": "Devesh", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran"}], "LastName": "Farzaei", "ForeName": "Mohammad H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran"}], "LastName": "Nabavi", "ForeName": "Seyed M", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31840607", "10.2174/1389201021666191216122555", "CPB-EPUB-102997"]}}]}
