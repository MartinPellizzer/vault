Genome study showed that D. catenatum is a specie of diploid with 38 chromosomes and 28 910 protein-coding genes. It was identified that specific genes accumulated in different organs at the transcriptome level. We got an insight into the gene regulation mechanism of the loss of the endospermous seed, the wide ecological adaptability and the synthesis of polysaccharides, which provided a theoretical basis for genetic engineering breeding and development and utilization of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The rapid propagation system was established for applying to industrialized production by overcoming breeding problems on seed setting and sprouting, which laid a foundation for artificial cultivation of D. catenatum. And in order to give a clear explanation of genetic variation of important economic traits, we built up the breeding system. Since special varieties of D. catenatum were bred, it helped solve the problem of trait segregation of seedling progeny and support the improvement of D. catenatum industry. The regulation of dynamic variation of target compounds, together with the mechanism of nutrient uptake, was revealed. The breakthrough of key technologies including culture substrates, light regulation and precisely collection was carried out. Several cultivation modes like facility cultivation, original ecological cultivation, cliff epiphytic cultivation, stereoscopic cultivation and potting cultivation were set up. Above all, the goal of cultivating D. catenatum as well as producing good D. catenatum will be achieved."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dendrobium State Forestry Engineering Research Center,State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture,Zhejiang A&F University,Linan 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Ji-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dendrobium State Forestry Engineering Research Center,State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture,Zhejiang A&F University,Linan 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization,the National Orchid Conservation Center of China and the Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen,Shenzhen 518114,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhong-Jian", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dendrobium State Forestry Engineering Research Center,State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture,Zhejiang A&F University,Linan 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany,Institute of Botany,Chinese Academy of Sciences,Beijing 100093,China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yi-Bo", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28822173", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0102"]}}]}
