Several systematic field visits and questionnaire surveys were carried out in selected sites of the study area to gather relevant information from the local community. Rapid assessment method was adopted for data collection by interviewing the local people having enough knowledge of medicinal plants use for treatment of different ailments. UV (UV) formula was applied to calculate the relative importance of medicinal plant species in each site of the study area. In the present study, 221 medicinal plants belonging to 105 families have been reported through 580 respondents (385 males, 138 females and 57 local health healer) from the Swabi and Hazara region. The main sources of herbal medicines were leaves (21%) followed by fruits (21%), seeds (17%), whole plants (14%), roots (9%), bark (9%), flowers (7%) and gum (2%). Mentha spicata L. and Berberis lycium Royle were reported with highest UV (UV) i.e. 0.92 and 0.68 in Razzar tehsil and Gadoon valley of Swabi, whereas Mentha longifolia L and Geranium wallichianum D were reported with highest UV i.e. (0.65) and (0.88) in Allai and Tanawal valley of Hazara region, respectively. It was concluded that Swabi and Hazara region is rich in medicinal plants species and associated traditional knowledge. Moreover, ethno-medicines have played significant role in the indigenous healthcare system of the study area. However, uprooting the entire plant for ethno-medicine is a big threat to conservation of medicinal plants diversity in the study area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4922-9642"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9622-4361"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3884-6565"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Noreen", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9321-0925"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bano", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0685-6443"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3102-8252"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7890-899X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4754-9960"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sabir", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5135-1308"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Wildlife Management, University of Haripur, Haripur City, KP, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Habiba", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34076167", "10.1590/1519-6984.243811", "S1519-69842022000100195"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
