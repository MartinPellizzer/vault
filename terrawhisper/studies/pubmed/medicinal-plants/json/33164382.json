The results showed that there were great differences in the names, basic sources, medicinal parts and efficacy of some medicinal materials recorded in different literatures. There were 19 genera and 60 species(including varieties) of Euphorbiaceae of Yao medicine, involving 50 kinds of medicinal materials. Among them, there were 42 kinds of single basic sources medicine, 8 kinds of multi basic sources medicine, 28 kinds of root medicine, 26 kinds of whole plant medicine, 25 kinds of unique Yao medicine, accounting for 50%, 11 kinds of cross with Chinese medicinal materials, accounting for 22%. There were 21 kinds of Yao medicine standards at all levels, but only 1 kind of Laoban medicine and 2 kinds of Yao medicine standards. The Yao medicine in Euphorbiaceae could be named by means of transliteration of Yao language/Yao language transliteration/Chinese medicine name, Laoban medicine, plant morphology, medicinal properties, color and smell of medicine, while the medicinal parts and efficacy of the same medicinal name were different from those of traditional Chinese medicine. Therefore, the name and basic sources of the medicinal materials in Euphorbiaceae were not standardized, and the quality standard is not perfect. The above results provided a reference for the construction and improvement of quality standard system, the promotion of the production of medicinal materials and clinical medication standards, and the further development and utilization of Euphorbiaceae."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanning 530200, China Guangxi Zhuang Yao Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center Nanning 530200, China Collaborative Innovation Center of Research on Functional Ingredients from Agricultural Residues of Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Dong-Ping", "ForeName": "T U", "Initials": "TU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanning 530200, China."}], "LastName": "Liu-Ping", "ForeName": "Wang", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanning 530200, China Guangxi Zhuang Yao Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center Nanning 530200, China."}], "LastName": "Li-Chun", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanning 530200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi-Qi", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Botanical of Guangxi Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi-Gang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao-Jun", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Records"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33164382", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200608.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
