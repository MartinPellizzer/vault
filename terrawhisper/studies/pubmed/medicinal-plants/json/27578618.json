The treatment has become more challenging and controversial as OHAs are heterogeneous in their mode of action that causes unwanted side effects. Complementary approaches such as use of medicinal plants and dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activities are therefore imperative. A vast literature has independently documented the effects of OHAs, medicinal plants and PUFA for management of diabetes. In the present article, we have reviewed the current literature to describe the effects of commonly used OHAs, their mechanisms of action and reported controversies. The antidiabetic potential of herbs and/or formulations and omega-3 PUFA with its potential benefits and mode of action is also discussed.", "PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library etc., were searched for relevant articles using appropriate terms (until February 2015). Human and animal studies were selected for the review. Data extraction was carried out by one author and checked by second author.", "There is still controversy over the safety profile of OHAs. Medicinal herbs with hypoglycemic activities are increasingly sought because of its natural origin, active constituents and minimal side effects. The current literature suggests that supplementation with PUFA improves macro- and microvascular complications.", "There is a need for best possible individualized treatment based on variations in biochemical parameters with combinational therapy of nutritional/herbal supplementations. Such a combination may be helpful for better management of diabetes and its complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
