He ingested datura seeds approximately 1.5 hour before the onset of the symptom. On arrival at our emergency clinic 2 hours and 40 minutes after the ingestion, he was semi-comatose with intermittent tonic convulsive seizures. The pupils were fully-dilated and unreactive, and salivation was decreased. He showed hypohidrosis and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes with positive Babinski's sign. His body temperature was 37.6 degrees C, and blood pressure was 167/99 mmHg. After gastrolavage and administration of charcoal and cathartics, his pupil became reactive to light, and he became alert gradually. His consciousness became clear 24 hours after seed ingestion and discharged with no residual neurological signs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Niigata Prefectural Shibata Hospital."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuwabara", "ForeName": "Takeo", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohshima", "ForeName": "Kazumi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Rinsho Shinkeigaku", "NlmUniqueID": "0417466", "ISSNLinking": "0009-918X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypohidrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}], "NumberOfReferences": "10"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15293758"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
