Psoriasis can be categorized as mild, moderate and severe conditions. In mild psoriasis, there is the formation of rashes, and when it becomes moderate, the skin turns scaly. In severe conditions, the red patches can be seen on the skin surface and the skin becomes itchy. The different treatment approaches include phototherapy, topical, oral and other systemic drug deliveries. Dermal treatment is now highly endorsed in topical indications for psoriatic patients, due to its higher penetration which can be achieved using pharmaceutical carriers.", "Though various conventional formulations are there, therapeutic benefits can be provided only to a limited extent. The objective of this review was to highlight newer biocompatible and biodegradable materials like phospholipids, and forefront drug delivery methods like liposomes, microemulsions, nanoemulsions, niosomes, ethosomes, etc. which has increased the possibility to improve the efficacy and safety of the topical products. Apart from this, many medicinal plants are available in nature that are used for treating skin diseases like psoriasis.", "The new trends in nanotechnology are marked by subsequent changes in the pharmaceutical research field. To safeguard the research works in the research field, various patents have been introduced, such as Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK 2981278) - ROR\u03b3 antagonist, etc. The causes, pathophysiology and the herbal plants that are used in treating the disease are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Kalpana", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, India."}], "LastName": "Nimisha"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101291922", "ISSNLinking": "1872-2105"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanomedicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32013854", "10.2174/1872210514666200204124130", "NANOTEC-EPUB-104214"]}}]}
