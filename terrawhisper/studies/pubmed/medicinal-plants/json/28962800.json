The physicochemical, antimicrobial and antifungal properties of oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin were systematically studied. The results showed that the oxidation level of oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin was successfully controlled by adjusting the dosage of hydrogen peroxide. The aqueous solubility of oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin was highly improved as expected. However, oxidation changed the morphology and partly reduced the crystallinity of oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin due to the introduced carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It is interesting that oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin presented a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, which was efficiently improved with the increasing oxidation level. Growth of A. niger spores was efficiently inhibited in the presence of oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin. Moreover, oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin could effectively extend the storage time of apple. In summary, oxidized \u03b2-cyclodextrin shows potential as antimicrobial and antifungal agents in food industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
