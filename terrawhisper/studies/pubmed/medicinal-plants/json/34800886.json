The most active candidates were further screened for their in vitro anticancer activity on NCI panel of 60 human cancer cell lines where compounds 2a, 2b, 4a-2, and 2e showed promising activity against various leukemia, non-small lung, renal, prostate, and breast cancer cell lines, particularly against NCI-H522 non-small lung cancer cell line (GI<sub>50</sub> of 0.35-0.60\u00a0\u00b5M), MCF7 breast cancer cell line (GI<sub>50</sub> of 0.34-0.59\u00a0\u00b5M), and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line (GI<sub>50</sub> of 0.23-0.40\u00a0\u00b5M). Compound 2b was the most potent against all leukemia and prostate cancer cell lines with GI<sub>50</sub> values (0.29-0.60\u00a0\u00b5M). Compound 2b inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and HepG2 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apopotosis. 2b downregulated the mRNA abundance of BAX, Apaf-1 and caspase-3 and upregulated BCL-2. The activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were declined in MCF-7 and HepG2 cells treated with compound 2b. Compounds 2b and 4a-2 inhibited tubulin polymerization, with an IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.92 and 1.13\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. These findings indicate that these synthesized compounds may represent potential drug candidates to inhibit the proliferation of different types of cancer cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
