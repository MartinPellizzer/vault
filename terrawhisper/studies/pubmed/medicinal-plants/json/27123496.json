The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which C. salsa extract (CSE) elicits an anti-proliferative effect on the prostate tissue of BPH-induced rats. The effects of CSE on BPH were evaluated in terms of prostate weight, production of serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the mRNA expression of 5\u03b1-reductase type 1 and type 2 in the prostate tissue of BPH-induced rats. In addition, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for histological examination of prostate gland morphology, and protein expression levels in prostate tissue were investigated by western blot analysis. CSE treatment decreased prostate weight, serum DHT concentration, and the mRNA expression of 5\u03b1-reductase type 1 and type 2 in prostate tissue of BPH-induced rats. In addition, CSE treatment suppressed cell proliferation by regulating the expression levels of inflammatory-related proteins (inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2) and apoptosis-associated proteins (caspase-3 and Bcl-2 family proteins). CSE may be a potential therapeutic candidate for BPH owing to its ability to regulate the expression of inflammatory and apoptosis-related proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Hyo-Jin An", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Kyung-Sook", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Hyo-Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "08J2K08A3Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Dihydrotestosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ptgs2 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Dihydrotestosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27123496", "10.1139/cjpp-2015-0112"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
