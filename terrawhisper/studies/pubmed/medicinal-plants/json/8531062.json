Yield of root and content (%DW) of saikosaponins in each part of root, 8-months-old, cultivated in E & F by both methods were at the same level as that cultivated for the same period in soil condition by generally standard procedures. Morphological characteristics of the root cultivated by the direct sowing method were the same appearance as that by soil condition, but by the transplanting method main root branched off in all direction and the lateral root were more developed than by the direct sowing method. By pinching lignification in xylem on the main root were inhibited, but the dried weight of total root part and content (%DW) of saikosaponins in each part of the root were not shown to be significantly changed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Kinki University, Nara, Japan."}], "LastName": "Minami", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yomo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohe", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ashida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sugino", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sapogenins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UR635J3F00", "NameOfSubstance": "saikosaponin D"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sapogenins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8531062", "10.1248/yakushi1947.115.10_832"]}}]}
