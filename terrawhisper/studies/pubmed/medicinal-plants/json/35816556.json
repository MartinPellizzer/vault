In the present study, we apply matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for rapid and reliable discrimination of <i>Brucella abortus</i> and <i>Brucella melitensis</i>, based on proteomic mass patterns from chemically treated whole-cell analyses. Biomarkers of the low molecular weight proteome in the MALDI-TOF MS spectra were assigned to conserved ribosomal and structural protein families that were found in genome assemblies of <i>B. abortus</i> and <i>B. melitensis</i> in the NCBI database. Significant protein mass signals successfully mapped to ribosomal proteins and structural proteins, such as integration host factor subunit alpha, cold-shock proteins, HU family DNA-binding protein, ATP synthase subunit C, and GNAT family N-acetyltransferase, with specific biomarker peaks that have been identified for each virulent and vaccine strain. Web-accessible bioinformatics algorithms, with a robust data analysis workflow, followed by ribosomal and structural protein mapping, significantly enhanced the reliable assignment of key proteins and accurate identification of <i>Brucella</i> species. Furthermore, clinical samples were analyzed to confirm the most dominant protein biomarker candidates and their relevance for the identifications of <i>B. melitensis</i> and <i>B. abortus</i>. With proper optimization, we envision that the presented MALDI-TOF MS proteomics analyses, coupled with special usage of bioinformatics, could be used as a cost-efficient strategy for the diagnostics of brucellosis and introduce a reliable identification protocol for species of dangerous bacteria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4764-1062"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, 19839-69411 Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamidi", "ForeName": "Hamideh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physico Chemistry, Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), 31975/148 Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bagheri Nejad", "ForeName": "Ramin", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physico Chemistry, Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), 31975/148 Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Es-Haghi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6435-9915"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, 19839-69411 Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghassempour", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Soc Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "9010412", "ISSNLinking": "1044-0305"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brucella abortus"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Brucellosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35816556", "10.1021/jasms.2c00110"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
