Subsequently, the therapeutic efficacy of LSTS and LSPS was evaluated by the improvement of anxiety and depression behaviors of the PCPA-induced mice.", "LSTS and LSPS exhibited similar saponin compositions but differ in their composition ratios, with liriopesides-type saponins accounting for a larger proportion in LSTS. Studies demonstrated that both LSTS and LSPS can extend sleep duration and immobility time, while reducing sleep latency in PCPA-induced mice. However, there was no significant difference in weight change among the various mice groups. Elisa results indicated that the LSTS and LSPS could decrease levels of NE, DA, IL-6, and elevate the levels of 5-HT, NO, PGD2 and TNF-\u03b1 in mice plasma. LSTS enhanced the expression of neurotransmitter receptors, while LSPS exhibited a more pronounced effect in regulating the expression of inflammatory factors. In conclusion, the saponins derived from L. spicata might hold promise as ingredients for developing health foods with sedative and hypnotic effects, potentially related to the modulation of serotonergic and GABA<sub>A</sub>ergic neuron expression, as well as immunomodulatory process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
