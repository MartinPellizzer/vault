The echocardiographic recordings were obtained at rest and during the continuous infusion of phenylephrine (40-60 micrograms/min) in order to allow an increase of 20-30 mmHg in systolic pressure.", "At rest, cardiac size and function were normal in both groups. During phenylephrine infusion in 27 patients a decrease in DD (from 37.7 +/- 4.6 to 31.0 +/- 4.0, p < 0.001); in EF (from 0.76 +/- 0.05 to 0.66 +/- 0.6, p < 0.001); in Vcf (from 1.05 +/- 0.77 to 0.76 +/- 0.13, p < 0.001) were observed. From this group 20 patients received digoxin. After the digitalization the phenylephrine test did not cause changes in DD (from 38.3 +/- 5.0 to 39.2 +/- 3.8, NS); in EF (from 0.77 +/- 0.06 to 0.77 +/- 0.04, NS); in Vcf (from 1.05 +/- 0.19 to 0.94 +/- 0.13, NS). These patients during the submaximal exercise test, showed significant increases at the total work load (from 617 +/- 248 to 982 +/- 244 watts, p < 0.001) and cardiac efficiency (from 25.0 +/- 11.5 to 37.2 +/- 10.4, p < 0.001).
