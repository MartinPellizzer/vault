To trace back it's sources, we conducted a systematical study on it's origin and quality by textual research and investigation in this paper,The result showed that the origins of Lilii Bulbus are mainly source from white-flowers, red-yellow-flowers and red-flowers of Lilium\uff0c L. brownii var. viridulum, which were believed authentic or good quality in all previous herbal literatures,and L. pumilum and L. concolor which belong to white-flowers,and L. lancifolium which belong to red-yellow-flowers were believed low-quality and unfit for medicinal uses, or they were listed below and often have different effect with L. brownii var. viridulum. Among them, only L. concolor does not belong to Lilii Bulbus according to Chinese Pharmacopeia (2015 edition), The mainstream varieties of Lilii Bulbus became L. lancifolium now according to our practical investigation, which were very different from previous herbal literatures. Although chemical and pharmacological studies provided a reference for L. lancifolium\uff0cwe should respect the actual records of the previous herbal literatures\uff0cthe research of material foundation of efficacy should be more sufficient\uff0cand provide science evidence for clinical application of different species of Lilii Bulbus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Fu-Jun", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ji-Feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science\uff0c Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs\uff0c National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica\uff0c China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences\uff0c Beijing 100700\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Zhi-Lai", "Initials": "ZL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29751724", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180201.005"]}}]}
