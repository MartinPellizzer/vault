Investigations on the development of effective chemotherapeutic agents and drug resistance inhibitors motivate studies on the effects of natural compounds on drug-resistant cancer cells. For this purpose, aqueous, methanol, and ethanol extracts of Fomes fomentarius and Tricholoma anatolicum were prepared. The extracts were evaluated to assess their anticancer and multiple drug resistance modulation activities. Cytotoxic effects of F. fomentarius and T. anatolicum extracts on paclitaxel and vincristine resistant P-glycoprotein over-expressing MCF-7 cell lines were investigated by cytotoxicity test (XTT). P-glycoprotein reversing ability and MDR modulation effects of the extracts were determined by flow cytometry through Rhodamine 123 exclusion assay. Furthermore, 11 phenolic compounds in the extracts were characterized by HPLC. As a result of the cytotoxicity assay, IC50 values of the extracts for MCF-7/Vinc were between 1.08 and 1.80 mg/mL, and IC50 values for MCF-7/Pac were found between 1.11 and 2.83 mg/mL. Strikingly, methanol extract of F. fomentarius and ethanol extract of T. anatolicum have potential value to become MDR reversing agents for drug-resistant breast cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Science Faculty, Sel\u00e7uk University, Campus, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Do\u011fan", "ForeName": "Hasan H\u00fcseyin", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Program, Meram Vocational School, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kars", "ForeName": "Meltem Demirel", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Science Faculty, Sel\u00e7uk University, Campus, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zdemir", "ForeName": "\u00d6zdem", "Initials": "\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcnd\u00fcz", "ForeName": "Ufuk", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5J49Q6B70F", "NameOfSubstance": "Vincristine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tricholoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vincristine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32478999", "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2020033174", "2c85f08c5b707d7a,4314b57572d977a3"]}}]}
