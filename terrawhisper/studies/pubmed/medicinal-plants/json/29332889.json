Ethanol crude extract of C. sappan (Cs-EtOH) was firstly compared to that of other medicinal plants using disc diffusion method. Cs-EtOH showed significantly higher effective inhibition against all tested strains than other extracts and 0.12% chlorhexidine with the inhibition zone of 17.5 \u00b1 0.5, 18.5 \u00b1 0.0, and 17.0 \u00b1 0.0 mm against Smu9, Smu4, and Si, respectively. Three fractionated extracts of C. sappan using hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol, respectively, were further investigated. The fractionated extract from ethanol (F-EtOH) presented the strongest activities with the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 125-250 \u00b5g/mL. Killing kinetics of F-EtOH was depended on the bacterial species and the concentration of F-EtOH. Two-fold MBC of F-EtOH could kill all tested strains within 12 h whereas its 4-fold MBC showed killing effect against Si within 6 h. Separation of F-EtOH by column chromatography using chloroform/methanol mixture as an eluent yielded 11 fractions (F1-F11). The fingerprints of these fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography at 280 nm revealed that F-EtOH consisted of at least 5 compounds. F6 possessed the significantly highest antimicrobial activity among 11 fractions, however less than F-EtOH. It is considered that F-EtOH is the promising extract of C. sappan for inhibiting oral pathogenic bacteria and appropriate as natural antiseptic for further develop of oral hygiene products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University."}], "LastName": "Puttipan", "ForeName": "Rinrampai", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory of Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University."}], "LastName": "Wanachantararak", "ForeName": "Penpicha", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Restorative Dentistry and Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Chiang Mai University."}], "LastName": "Khongkhunthian", "ForeName": "Sakornrat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology, Chiang Mai University."}], "LastName": "Okonogi", "ForeName": "Siriporn", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Drug Discov Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101493809", "ISSNLinking": "1881-7831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76845O8NMZ", "NameOfSubstance": "ethyl acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caesalpinia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gingivitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus intermedius"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29332889", "10.5582/ddt.2017.01055"]}}]}
