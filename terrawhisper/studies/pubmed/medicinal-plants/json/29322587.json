Herbchronology, the numerical and pattern analysis of annual growth rings in herbaceous perennials, has emerged to be a recognized science that is applied in age determination of perennial forbs. Fifty medicinal species growing in temperate and subtropical zones of China were examined by microstructure observation to determine the presence of growth rings in the secondary root xylem of medicinal perennial dicotyledonous herbs. Nearly half of the surveyed species showed clearly or relatively clearly demarcated growth rings in their roots, and additional anatomical patterns have been observed in different species. Clear variations in growth rings of different genus or species were characterized in this study, and these findings proved the feasibility of applying herbaceous plant growth rings in age identification of traditional Chinese medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, 266109, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Lingling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chanchan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4656-1543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection and Development, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Huasheng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Haiyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijng, 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Luqi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Xylem"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29322587", "10.1002/jemt.22987"]}}]}
