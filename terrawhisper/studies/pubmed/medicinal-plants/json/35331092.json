Engineered drugs are accessible for the treatment; however, they do experience adverse effects as the treatment requires a prolonged duration worsened by noncompliance. To overwhelm it, certain pharmacological and molecular pathways are explored in the wake of Chinese herbs that prompted the prevention of this deteriorating autoimmune disease. The alcoholic extracts and decoctions are procured from Chinese herbs, such as Paeonia lactiflora, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Tripterygium wilfordii, etc., which have been proved to manifest constructive pharmacological actions. The activities that were exhibited by extracts are significantly innocuous, non-toxic, and potent to fix the affliction in contrast with the chemosynthetic drugs. Therefore, these Chinese herbs bring forth potent anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressing, anti-nociceptive, anti-neovascularizing, free radical scavenging activities, and various other benefits to withstand several pathological events that usually endure infirmity. It can be abridged that Chinese herbs possess assorted and selective therapeutic properties with profound safety and viability to treat this rheumatic disorder. Thus, this review aims to shed light on naturally originated treatment that is pertinent to providing invulnerable therapy exonerating from adverse effects by restraining joint deformities, production of auto-antibodies, and inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Twinkle", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Parth", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Chandel", "ForeName": "Parteek", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Sukhbir", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Pharmacy, Amity University, Noida, India."}], "LastName": "Naved", "ForeName": "Tanveer", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Health Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural & Medical Sciences Research Centre, University of Nizwa, Nizwa, Oman."}], "LastName": "Bhatia", "ForeName": "Saurabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural & Medical Sciences Research Centre, University of Nizwa, Nizwa, Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Oradea, Oradea, Romania."}], "LastName": "Bungau", "ForeName": "Simona", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Behl", "ForeName": "Tapan", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Rheumatoid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tripterygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35331092", "10.2174/1381612828666220324124720", "CPD-EPUB-121843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
