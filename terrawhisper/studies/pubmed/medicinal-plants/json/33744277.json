In this context, this article investigated the antinociceptive activity of \u03b1-PHE using in vivo Sarcoma-180-induced hypernociception in mice to detail its mechanism(s) of antinociception under different conditions of treatment and tumor progression. Firsty, in vitro cytotoxic action was assessed using melanoma B-16/F-10 and S-180 murine cells and colorimetric MTT assays. For in vivo studies, acute treatment with \u03b1-PHE (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg orally by gavage) was performed on the 1st day after S-180 inoculation. Subacute treatments were performed for 8\u00a0days starting on the next day (early protocol) or on day 8 after S-180 inoculation (late protocol). For all procedures, mechanical nociceptive evaluations were carried out by von Frey's technique in the subaxillary region peritumoral tissue (direct nociception) and in right legs of S-180-bearing mice (indirect nociception). \u03b1-PHE showed in vitro cytotoxic action on B-16/F-10 and S-180 (CI<sub>50</sub> values of 436.0 and 217.9\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), inhibition of in vivo tumor growth (ranging from 47.3 to 82.7%) and decreased direct (peritumoral tissue in subaxillary region) and indirect (right leg) mechanical nociception in Sarcoma 180-bearing mice with early and advanced tumors under acute or subacute conditions of treatment especially at doses of 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg. It improved serum levels of GSH as well as diminished systemic lipid peroxidation, blood cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, -4, -6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1). Such outcomes highlight \u03b1-PHE as a promising lead compound that combines antinociceptive and antineoplasic properties. Its structural simplicity make it a cost-effective alternative, justifying further mechanistic investigations and the development of pharmaceutical formulations. Moreover, the protocols developed and standardized here make it possible to use Sarcoma-180 hypernociception model to evaluate the capacity of new antinociceptive molecules under conditions of cancer-related allodynia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
