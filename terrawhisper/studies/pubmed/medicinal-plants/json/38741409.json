Synthesis of drug from plants has main interest due the significant medicinal values. The recent investigation was designed to examine the pharmacological impacts of Ficus carica leaves extract on stress. In this experiment, the rodents were randomly distributed as (n=6) control rats were kept at standard condition, second group of rats were exposed with different stressors and Third group of rodents was exposed to stress and treated with extract of ficus carica leaves at the dose of 100 mg/kg. Acute behavioural alteration was observed after 7 days and prolonged impact was monitored after the 28 days. The current finding showed that administration of Ficus carica leaves extract produced anxiolytic behaviours and decreased depression like symptoms in CUMS treated rats. It also increased stimulatory, ambulatory, locomotor activity and enhanced spatial working memory and recognition memory in CUMS exposed rats. So, it can be concluded from recent study that leaves of Ficus carica can be utilized as secure drug for curing physiological stress with less side effect profile."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khaliq", "ForeName": "Saima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ruby", "ForeName": "Tabinda", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurochemistry and Biochemical Neuropharmacology Research Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farhan", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nadeem", "ForeName": "Wajahat", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ficus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38741409"]}}]}
