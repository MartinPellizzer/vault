Structure of liver was observed and liver mitochondrial swelling was measured following D-GalN injection without or with TCE. In vitro: D-GalN-induced primary cultured hepatocytes injury model was used to value the effect of TCE on cultured hepatocytes. Cell viability was measured by means of MTT assay, and the AST and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in supernatant of cultured cells were investigated also.", "In acute hepatic injury test, with oral pretreatment of TCE, remarkable rises in serum AST and ALT activities (2.95 fold and 3.35 fold) induced by D-GalN were obviously reversed and significant morphological changes were remarkably lessened. In addition, the decrease in sensitivity of mitochondrial swelling to the exotic Ca2+ stimulation induced by D-GalN was also prevented by TCE. In primary cultured hepatocytes of mice, it was found that incubation with TCE could prevent the decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. It was also found that both the increase in AST level (1.9 fold) and the decrease in SOD activity (48.0%) in supernatant of primary cultured hepatocytes induced by D-GalN could be inhibited by pretreatment of TCE.", "TCE has hepatoprotective activity and the mechanisms underlying its protective effect may be related to its antioxidant activity and protection on both hepatocytes and liver mitochondria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Medica, School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xin-hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Li-zhi", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zeng-rong", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7535-00-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Galactosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terminalia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15656141"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
