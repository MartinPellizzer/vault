Pesticides are often used to prevent and control diseases and insect pests and regulate the growth of Chinese medicinal plants, so as to improve the yield and quality of Chinese medicinal materials. Most of the pesticides can play a role in pest control through systemic action, stomach toxicity, contact, fumigation and other ways, especially the systemic pesticides can kill hidden pests by entering the Chinese medicinal plants. Despite the good pest control effect, it is difficult to remove the systemic pesticides by simple cleaning, which poses a great risk to the safety of Chinese medicinal materials. At the same time, excessive or non-standard use of pesticides leads to serious pesticide residues in Chinese medicinal materials, which affects not only the quality and efficacy of the materials and harm human health but also the international development of Chinese medicinal materials industry. Pesticide residues have become a bottleneck affecting the industry development and hindering the export of Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, it is of great significance to study how to quickly, sensitively, and accurately detect and remove pesticide residues in Chinese medicinal materials. We reviewed the common pesticide residues in Chinese medicinal materials in recent years in terms of characteristics, harm, and detection and removal techniques, and discussed the future development of the detection and removal deve-lopment. With this review, we aimed to provide a reference for the quality control of Chinese medicinal materials and promote the healthy development of Chinese medicine industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Li-Xue", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Gao-Qiong", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Wan-Jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Heng-Ye", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities Wuhan 430074, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35718510", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20211209.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
