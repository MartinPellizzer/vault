Further Ni, Cd, and Pb were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Most elements vary in a narrow range by a factor of 2-4 while a few others vary in a wide range, e.g., Na (0.05-0.67 mg/g), Mn (26.7-250 microg/g), and V (0.26-2.50 microg/g). All the five brands contain K, Cl, Mg, P, and Ca as minor constituents along with mean trace amounts of Cr (2.11 +/- 0.67 microg/g), Cu (15.7 +/- 7.11 microg/g), Fe (459 +/- 171 microg/g), Mn (143 +/- 23 microg/g), Se (238 +/- 112 ng/g), and V (0.99 +/- 0.93 microg/g). Jambrushila is enriched in Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, Fe, Cu, Se, and Zn, essential nutrients responsible for curing diabetes. Dietary intake of Mn, Fe, and Cu are greater than 10% of the recommended dietary allowance, whereas that for Zn and Se is less than 2%. Mean contents of toxic elements (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) were found below permissible limits except in Jambrushila. Cr and Zn were inversely correlated with r = -0.81, whereas Rb and Cs exhibit linear correlation (r = 0.93) in five brands. C, H, N analysis showed C approximately 55%, H approximately 12%, and N approximately 2% with a total of approximately 70% organic matter. However, thermal decomposition studies at 700 degrees C suggest less than 5% nonvolatile metal oxides. Herbal formulations contain minor and trace elements in bioavailable forms that favorably influence glucose tolerance and possibly increase the body's ability to ameliorate development of diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee 247 667, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choudhury", "ForeName": "R Paul", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "A V R", "Initials": "AV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Micronutrients"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Micronutrients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutron Activation Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17916967", "10.1007/s12011-007-8022-6", "BTER:120:1-3:148"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
