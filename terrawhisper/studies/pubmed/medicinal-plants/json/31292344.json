Because it is not clear whether \u03b2-carotene suppresses inflammation in AD skin tissues, we examined the effects of oral administration of \u03b2-carotene in mice induced by a low zinc/magnesium diet (HR-AD diet). Our studies found that AD-like inflammation was remarkably reduced by \u03b2-carotene. In addition, \u03b2-carotene significantly suppressed protein expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and MCP-1 and mRNA expression of TSLP, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-4, IL-5, and Par-2 in AD-like skin tissues. It was also found that mRNA and protein expression of filaggrin (a major structural protein in epidermis) in AD-like skin was significantly elevated by \u03b2-carotene administration. Furthermore, \u03b2-carotene treatment significantly reduced the activity and/or mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), degradation of the extracellular matrix and regulation of chemokines. These results suggest that \u03b2-carotene reduces skin inflammation through the suppressed expression of inflammatory factors or the activity of MMPs as well as the promotion of filaggrin expression in AD-like skin. \u03b2-Carotene is a potent anti-inflammatory agent, which improves AD-like skin by enhancing the skin barrier function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Noriko", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Kake", "ForeName": "Takamichi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Hasegawa", "ForeName": "Shinya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University."}], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "Masahiko", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Filaggrin Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Intermediate Filament Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Epidermis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Extracellular Matrix"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Filaggrin Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intermediate Filament Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Hairless"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31292344", "10.5650/jos.ess19092"]}}]}
