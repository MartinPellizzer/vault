This repressive architecture, which confers stringent spatial regulation, is disrupted upon transcriptional activation during embryogenesis in a process that requires the presence of both a transcription factor (PvALF) and abscisic acid (ABA). Toward determining the need for de novo synthesis of proteins other than PvALF in transcriptional activation we explored the effect of several eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitors. Surprisingly, cycloheximide (CHX), emetine, and verrucarin A were able to induce transcription from the phas promoter in tobacco and bean leaf tissue in the absence of either PvALF or ABA. This induction was decreased by the replication inhibitors hydroxyurea and aphidicolin but not by genistein or mimosine. Since protein phosphatases and kinases are essential components of the ABA signal transduction pathway, it is conceivable that CHX is also capable of inducing phosphorylation of proteins usually involved in ABA-mediated activation. Interestingly, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase, also strongly activated transcription from the phas promoter. In contrast, the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and puromycin did not activate transcription from the phas promoter, nor did the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors phenylarsine oxide and sodium orthovanadate. These discrete but different results on transcriptional activation may reflect specific modes of action of the inhibitors, or they may reflect differential interactions of the inhibitors or of downstream events resulting from inhibitor activity with presently unknown components of the transcriptional activation system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Developmental and Molecular Biology and Department of Biology, Texas A & M University, College Station, Texas 77843-3155, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bishop", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "T C", "Initials": "TC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104042-75-3", "NameOfSubstance": "phaseolin protein, Phaseolus vulgaris"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1W21G5Q4N2", "NameOfSubstance": "Okadaic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98600C0908", "NameOfSubstance": "Cycloheximide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.16", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cycloheximide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Okadaic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11031270", "10.1074/jbc.M007504200", "S0021-9258(18)46712-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
