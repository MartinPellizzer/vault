However, the modified AA derivative N-(2\u03b1,3\u03b2,23-acetoxyurs-12-en-28-oyl)-l-proline methyl ester (AA-PMe) has shown markedly better anti-tumor activity than AA. MATERIAL AND METHODS We evaluated the toxicity of AA and AA-PMe on zebrafish morphology, mortality, and hatching rate and determined the effect on SGC7901 cancer cells by acute toxicity assay. AA-PMe absorption in vitro in SGC7901 cells and in vivo in zebrafish was determined by establishing a highly accurate and reproducible HPLC protocol. RESULTS In zebrafish, the toxicity of AA-PMe was lower than AA, with an acute toxic dose of AA-PMe above 25 \u03bcM, compared to acute toxicity at doses above 10 \u03bcM for AA. However, chronic toxicity of AA-PMe began occurring at doses below 25 \u03bcM but became apparent for AA at doses below 10 \u03bcM. Although low doses of AA-PMe were tolerated acutely, it became chronically toxic during zebrafish development, resulting in morphological abnormalities, including peripheral and abdominal edema, hemorrhage, abnormal body shape, enlarged yolk sac, and reduced motility. At low concentrations, absorption of AA-PMe by cells and zebrafish embryos occurred in a dose-dependent manner, but this stabilized as the concentration increased. CONCLUSIONS This pharmacokinetic study outlines the cellular and organismal effects of AA-PMe and suggests a theoretical basis that may underlie its mechanism of action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for New Drug Research and Development, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for New Drug Research and Development, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for New Drug Research and Development, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wenxiu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for New Drug Research and Development, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Oral Drug Delivery System of Chinese Material Medical of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Branch of China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yingjie", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory of Stomatology, Nanjing Stomatological Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for New Drug Research and Development, College of Life Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zhunan", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Monit", "NlmUniqueID": "9609063", "ISSNLinking": "1234-1010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Centella asiatica extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9PA5A687X5", "NameOfSubstance": "asiatic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pentacyclic Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zebrafish"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interest</b>.
