A ternary porogenic system including dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, and room temperature ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was employed to fabricate imprinted monolith with high porosity and good flow-through properties, in which chicoric acid (CA), zinc acetate, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP), and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) was the template, metallic ion, functional monomer, as well as crosslinker, respectively. The influence of polymerization factors including the 4-VP-CA ratio, monomer-crosslinker ratio, template-Zn<sup>2+</sup> ratio on imprinting factors was systematically investigated. When the ratio of 4-VP to CA was 24:1, the greatest IF value (24.81) was achieved on the CA-MIP prepared with zinc acetate. In addition, off-line SPE with the optimal MIPs monolith led to high purity of CA (98.0% \u00b1 0.5%) from extraction of Cichorium intybus L. roots with the recovery of 77.5% \u00b1 2.5% (n = 6). As a conclusion,\u00a0the strategy of introducing metal ions as metal pivot to prepare MIPs was a powerful method for the MIPs synthesis to the template molecules with intramolecular hydrogen bonds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Ya Kun", "Initials": "YK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Man", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100039, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. zhaoshengliu@sohu.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. zhaoshengliu@sohu.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhao-Sheng", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. haji@ms.xjb.ac.cn."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, Xinjiang, 830011, China. haji@ms.xjb.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29279986", "10.1007/s00216-017-0765-0", "10.1007/s00216-017-0765-0"]}}]}
