Cholistani plants are reported as a rich source of antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antioxidant, and anticancer agents. The current study has evaluated antiviral potential of selected Cholistani plants. The whole plants were collected, ground and used in extract formation with n-hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. All the extracts were concentrated by using a rotary evaporator and concentrate was finally dissolved in an appropriate vol of the same solvent. All of the extracts were tested for their antiviral potential by using 9-11 days old chick embryonated eggs. Each extract was tested against the Avian Influenza virus H9N2 strain (AIV), New Castle Disease virus Lasoota strain (NDV), Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and an Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Hemagglutination test (HA) and Indirect Hemagglutination (IHA) tests were performed for different viruses. The overall order of the antiviral potential of Cholistani plants against viruses was NDV>IBV>IBDV>AIV. In terms of antiviral activity from extracts, the order of activity was n-butanol>ethyl acetate>n-hexane. The medicinal plants Achyranthes aspera, Neuroda procumbens, Panicum antidotale, Ochthochloa compressa and Suaeda fruticose were very effective against all four poultry viruses through their extracts. The low IC50 values of these extracts confirm the high antiviral potential against these viruses. It is worth to mention that Achyranthes aspera was found positive against IBDV through all its extracts which overcome the problem of unavailability of any known drug against IBDV. In short, the study proved that Cholistani plants are rich source of antiviral agent and their extracts can be used as good source of antiviral drugs both in crude and in purified form."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology.
