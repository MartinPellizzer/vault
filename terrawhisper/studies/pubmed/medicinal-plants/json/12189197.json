To evaluate the possibility and potential mechanism(s) of which resveratrol inhibits N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis, 96 F344 male rats were divided into 10 groups and resveratrol (1 and 2 mg/kg) was administered orally or intraperitoneally (i.p.). In the groups in which resveratrol was administered at 2 mg/kg (orally, for 16 weeks), 1 and 2 mg/kg (i.p., for 16 weeks) and 1 mg/kg (i.p., for 20 weeks), the number of NMBA-induced esophageal tumors per rat was significantly reduced to 78, 62, 54 and 48, respectively (P < 0.05), and the size of maximum tumors in each group with resveratrol treatment was also significantly smaller than that in NMBA alone group (P < 0.05). Although the pathological examination did not indicate significantly decreased incidence of carcinomas by administering resveratrol, the tendency of carcinogensis suppression was observed (P = 0.177). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA analysis demonstrated that following NMBA treatment, the expression of COX-1 mRNA was strongly present in tumor tissues, while weakly present in non-tissues; the expression of COX-2 mRNA was induced in both tumor and non-tumor tissues. The production of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) increased approximately 6-fold, compared with the normal esophageal mucosa. The higher expression of COX-1, the up-regulated COX-2 expression and the increased levels of PGE(2) synthesis were all significantly decreased by administering resveratrol. Our study suggests that resveratrol suppressed NMBA-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis by targeting COXs and PGE(2), and therefore may be a promising natural anti-carcinogenesis agent for the prevention and treatment of human esophageal cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery and Surgical Basic Science, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54-Shogoin, Kawahra-cho, Sakyoku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimada", "ForeName": "Yutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Komoto", "ForeName": "Izumi", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawabe", "ForeName": "Atsushi", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Yongzeng", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaganoi", "ForeName": "Junichi", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hashimoto", "ForeName": "Yosuke", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imamura", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "937-40-6", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrosobenzylmethylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ptgs1 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "enzymology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12189197", "10.1093/carcin/23.9.1531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
