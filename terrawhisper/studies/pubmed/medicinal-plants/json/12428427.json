The in vitro antiplasmodial assay was carried out using a chloroquine-sensitive strain of malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum D10. A preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts was carried out using UV spectral analysis and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to separate the chemical constituents of the extracts. Their chemical components were subsequently identified by treating the TLC plates with various spray reagents. Of the 14 plant extracts investigated, only 10 were found to have IC50 values of 10-50 micrograms/ml. The two most active extracts were Psidium guajava stem-bark extract and Vangueria infausta leaf extract, both of which showed IC50 values of 10-20 micrograms/ml. Phytochemical analysis of these two active plant extracts revealed the presence of anthraquinones, flavonoids, seccoirridoids and terpenoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Durban-Westville, Durban, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nundkumar", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ojewole", "ForeName": "J A O", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7909595", "ISSNLinking": "0379-0355"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "886U3H6UFF", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroquine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroquine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12428427", "10.1358/mf.2002.24.7.696540", "696540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
