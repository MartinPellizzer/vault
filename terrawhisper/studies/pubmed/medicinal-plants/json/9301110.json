When mice were successively injected with OK-432, severe TNF-alpha was induced in the serum, but this elevated TNF-alpha level was reduced after an oral administration of PLE (400 microliters/mouse). Oral administration of PLE also inhibited TNF-alpha production that was induced by muramyl dipeptide (500 micrograms/mouse) and OK-432 (3 KE/mouse). These characteristics were obtained from all strains of perilla. The inhibitory activity against TNF-alpha production was heat-stable, and the existence of several active molecules was suggested. When PLE was passed through an ultrafilter, the inhibitory activity against TNF-alpha production was collected in those fractions with a mass of 0.5 to 1 kDa and more than 10 kDa. When PLE was solvent-extracted, the strongest activity was recognized with aqueous preparation, although significant activity was also detected in preparations extracted with n-hexane and ethyl acetate. These findings suggest that the daily use of certain functional foods may be useful for controlling the host defense system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ueda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9301110", "10.1271/bbb.61.1292"]}}]}
