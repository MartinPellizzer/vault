The most common treatment consists of administering the drugs levodopa and biperiden, which reduce the effectiveness of the disease and the progress of its symptoms. However, phytotherapy treatment of PD has shown great potential in retarding the loss of dopaminergic neurons and minimizing the behavioral abnormalities. The aim of this study is to systematically review the use of supplemental herbal plants with cellular protective effect and behavioral activity in in vivo and in vitro experimental models. A total of 20 studies were summarized, where the effectiveness of herbal extracts and their isolated bioactive compounds was observed in animal models for PD. The main neurochemical mechanisms found in these studies are schematically represented. The herbal extracts and their biocompounds have antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and antiinflammatory properties, which contribute to avoiding neuronal loss. Reports show that besides acting on the biosynthesis of dopamine and its metabolites, these compounds prevent D2 receptors' hypersensitivity. It is suggested that further studies need be conducted to better understand the mechanisms of action of the bioactive compounds distributed in these plants.
