Forty-four patients (16.7%) showed some allergic symptoms after testing with fruits and vegetables, melon being the food most frequently involved (24 patients), followed by sunflower seed (12 patients). Skin testing was done by the prick method with natural fruit or vegetable, and also with commercial food extracts. We found in our region that the distribution of sensitivity to pollens in the group of patients with allergy to fruits or vegetables does not coincide with the prevalence in pollen-allergic subjects in general, since in the first group--subjects allergic to food--there was a major prevalence of allergy to Plantago (P < 0.01). In particular, in the group of subjects allergic to melon, the prevalence of sensitivity to grass and especially to Plantago was larger than in pollen-allergic subjects in general (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). The use of fresh food produced better results than commercial extracts. A positive skin test to fresh melon closely correlated with positive CAP results. CAP inhibition experiments were carried out, and we found that Dactylis and Plantago extracts inhibited the binding of the melon-positive pool to solid-phase melon. The results suggest the existence of common antigenic epitopes in melon and Plantago pollen, and in melon and grass pollen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unidad de Alergolog\u00eda, Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, C\u00e1ceres, Spain."}], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda Ortiz", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cosmes Mart\u00edn", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lopez-Asunolo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioallergosorbent Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7545882", "10.1111/j.1398-9995.1995.tb01145.x"]}}]}
