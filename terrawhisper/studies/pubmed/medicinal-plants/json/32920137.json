Sideritis bilgeriana (Lamiaceae) is medicinal plant used in Turkey folk medicine to reduce inflammation and pain, but few studies scientific corroborates its medicinal use so creating a gap between popular use and scientific evidence. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effects of the methanolic extract of S. bilgeriana (MESB) in rodents nociception models and also performed its phytochemical analysis. Firstly, a screening was carried out that enabled the identification of the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids. In view of this, a chromatographic method by HPLC-DAD-UV was developed that made it possible to identify chlorogenic acid and its quantification in MESB. MESB-treated mice (MESB 50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and myeloperoxidase activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and also showed a reduced pain behavior in capsaicin test. In the carrageenan-induced pleurisy test, MESB (100\u00a0mg/kg p.o.) significantly reduced the leukocyte (polymorphonuclear) count in the pleural cavity and equally decreased the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the PSNL model, mechanical hyperalgesia was reduced on the first evaluation day and during the 7 days of evaluation compared to the vehicle group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thermal hyperalgesia was also reduced 1\u00a0h after treatment compared to the vehicle group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and reversed the loss of force initially displayed by the animals, thus inferring an analgesic effect in the muscle strength test. Analysis of the marrow of these animals showed a decrease in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and factor NF-\u03baB, in relation to the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the MESB treatment produced no noticeable side effects, no disturb in motor performance and no signs of gastric or hepatic injury. Together, the results suggests that MESB could be useful to management of inflammation and neuropathic pain mainly by the management of pro-inflammatory mediators (NF-\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6), so reinforcing its use in popular medicine and corroborating the need for further chemical and pharmacological studies for the species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
