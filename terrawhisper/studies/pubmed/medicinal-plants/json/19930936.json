Lindl. In the attached images of Zhiwumingshitukao of the Qing dynasty, the name of Mugua was transposed. It has affected Japanese and some Chinese scholars in succession, which lead to the confused situation that mistook Mugua as the Chinese name of Ch. sinensis (Thouin) Kochne as well as Tiegenghaitang as the Chinese name of Ch. speciosa (Sweet) Nakai in current literature. It is proposed that it be decided to change the Chinese name of Ch. sinensis (Thouin)Koehne to Mugua, Ch. sinensis (Thouin) Koehne to Mingzha as well as Ch. japonica (Thunb.)
