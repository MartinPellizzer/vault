Subjects were required to undergo a hypoxia tolerance test (7.1% O<sub>2</sub>) and a cardiopulmonary function evaluation (Bruce treadmill protocol) before (1st day) and after (9th day) the trial. Simultaneously, the anti-oxidative activities (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, MDA), routine and biochemical analyses of blood samples were evaluated.", "The females' SpO<sub>2</sub> increased significantly by 6.4% at the end of the hypoxia tolerance test after taking turnips (p<0.05), and the hypoxia symptoms in most of the subjects were alleviated as well. The anaerobic threshold, peak O<sub>2</sub> pulse and peak VO<sub>2</sub>/kg were significantly improved after 7-d turnip consumption during the Bruce treadmill test (p<0.05). As for the blood analysis, anti-oxidative activities were boosted effectively after the 7-d treatments. Moreover, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in the males of feeding group increased significantly (p<0.05). However, little changes of all variables were observed in the control group.", "Consumption of Tibetan turnips for 7 days likely contributed to the hypoxia tolerance in healthy humans, which could be due to its abilities of improving oxygen uptake and delivery, enhancing body antioxidant capacity and increasing MCHC. However, further studies with larger samples and double-blind design are warranted, and future studies covering more diverse populations (unhealthy, athletic) would be also considered. Moreover, researches on identifying Tibetan turnip's active compounds are desired as well."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
