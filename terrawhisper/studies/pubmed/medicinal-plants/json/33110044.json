Participants were randomized into equal intervention and control (control) groups. The intervention and control groups received four capsules of Fennel seed powder (2 gr) and starch-containing capsules (2 gr) daily over 8 weeks, respectively. Menopausal symptoms and sexual desire of the participants were evaluated using both the menopausal Kupperman index and Hurlbert index of sexual desire. The questionnaires were completed at baseline, week 4 and week 8 of the study by the participants. The serum estradiol levels were measured at baseline and also at the end of the study. The Chi-square test, independent t test, and repeated-measures analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.", "Menopausal symptoms score significantly decreased from 30.8\u200a\u00b1\u200a6 to 19\u200a\u00b1\u200a5.5 in the intervention group and also from 31.2\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.5 to 26.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a6.2 in the control group (P\u200a<\u200a0.05). Treatment with Fennel seed did not significantly enhance the participants sexual desire (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). The estradiol levels declined in the intervention (from 60.4\u200a\u00b1\u200a43.4 to 52.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a25.7) and control groups (from 55.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a22.4 to 39.9\u200a\u00b1\u200a26.9). However, this decrease was lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The intergroup differences were not statistically significant (P\u200a>\u200a0.05).", "The results of the present study indicated that daily use of Fennel seed significantly improved menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women over 8 weeks, though its effect on estradiol levels and sexual desire was not significant. Further studies with a larger sample size and longer duration are needed to verify these findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaffari", "ForeName": "Parvin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Nursing, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseininik", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor of Nursing, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afrasiabifar", "ForeName": "Ardashir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Petroleum Industry Health Organization, Hospital Gachsaran Oil Industry (Besat), Ministry of Petroleum, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseininik", "ForeName": "Amar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabatabaei", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Marzieh", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Nazafarin", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Menopause", "NlmUniqueID": "9433353", "ISSNLinking": "1072-3714"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foeniculum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Menopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postmenopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Lay AAR, Nascimento CF, Oliveira Duarte YA, Chiavegatto Filho ADP.
