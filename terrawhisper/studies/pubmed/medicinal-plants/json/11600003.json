The biologically active components of P. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. The activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. The growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. Two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against Clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against Escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. Weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or Lactobacillus acidophilus. The inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in C. perfringens and E. coli as compared to B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. fragilis, B. longum, or L. acidophilus. Cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. These results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of P. cernua root."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Industrial Development of Biofood Materials and Institute of Agricultural and Technology, College of Agriculture, Chonbuk National University, Chonju 561-756, Republic of Korea. hoiseon@moak.chonbuk.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beon", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Growth Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "140-10-3", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7864XYD3JJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrolein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AVM951ZWST", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SR60A3XG0F", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acrolein"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bifidobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium perfringens"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Growth Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus acidophilus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11600003", "10.1021/jf010609z", "jf010609z"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
