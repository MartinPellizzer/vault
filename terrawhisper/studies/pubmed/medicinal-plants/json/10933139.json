Liver injury was induced by oral administration of carbon tetrachloride (1 mL kg(-1)) twice a week during 4 weeks of A. iwayomogi treatment. Extracts from A. iwayomogi were prepared and administered to rats orally (2 g kg(-1) as A. iwayomogi for 4 weeks) as follows: group 1, hot-water extract; group 2, ethanol-soluble part of hot-water extract; group 3, ethanol-insoluble part of hot-water extract; and group 4, methanol extract. In rats treated with the ethanol-soluble part of the hot-water extract, liver hydroxyproline content was reduced to 74% that of carbon tetrachloride control rats (P < 0.05). Protein expression of alpha smooth muscle cell like actin was also decreased in rats treated with the ethanol-soluble part of the hot-water extract, which indicates inhibition of hepatic stellate cell activation. Liver malondialdehyde levels were significantly lowered in rats treated with the ethanol-soluble part of hot-water extract (P < 0.05). Serum cholesterol levels in rats treated with hot-water extract, ethanol-soluble or -insoluble parts of hot-water extract or methanol extract were significantly reduced when compared with those of carbon tetrachloride control rats (P < 0.05). The ethanol-soluble part of the hot-water extract from A. iwayomogi inhibited fibrosis and lipid peroxidation in rats with liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride. Both hot-water extract (either ethanol-soluble or -insoluble) and methanol extract of A. iwayomogi also lowered serum cholesterol levels in fibrotic rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Medical Resources Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Cheonbuk, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nan", "ForeName": "J X", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10933139", "10.1211/0022357001774561"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
