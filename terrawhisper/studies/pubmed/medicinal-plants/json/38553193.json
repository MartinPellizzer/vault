Magrandate A (1) is notable as the first C18 homogemarane type SL, featuring a unique 1,7-dioxaspiro[4.4]nonan-6-one core. Compounds 2 and 3, representing the first instances of chlorine-substituted gemarane-type SL analogs in natural products, were also identified. The structures of these isolates were elucidated through a combination of spectroscopic data analysis, electronic circular dichroism calculations, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis. All isolates demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Notably, 3-5 showed a significant inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.79 to 4.73 \u03bcmol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. Additionally, 4 and 5 exhibited moderate cytotoxic activities against three cancer cell lines, with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 3.09 and 11.23 \u03bcmol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 China Pharmaceutical University.
