Even in modern times, immense popularity of various spas and water therapies is an example of the first type of anti-aging approach for which there are no real scientific basis. Some preliminary support from laboratory and/or clinical tests is available for various herbal and other medicinal plant products, such as ginseng, ginkgo biloba and garlic, as nutritional supplements.
