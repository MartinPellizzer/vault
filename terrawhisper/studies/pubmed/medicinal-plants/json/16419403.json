Aggressive wash procedures, consisting of 1 isopropanol wash, three 30-min, and two 1-h buffer washes, followed by digestion, extraction and confirmation of digested samples, resulted in values from the cutoff of 2 ng morphine/10 mg hair to greater than 200 ng/10 mg hair. Both morphine and MAM were present above the cutoff in all hair samples from 69 clinical subjects. Only 39 of the 69 heroin-using subjects had urine tests positive for 6-MAM. In a study of morphine in hair following poppy seed consumption, ten subjects ingested 150 g of poppy seed over 3 weeks. Urine samples were collected on the days of poppy seed ingestion and hair samples were taken in the 5th week of the study. The range among the 10 subjects of the highest urine value for each subject was 2929 to 13,827 ng morphine/mL. Hair morphine levels were 0.05-0.48 ng/10 mg hair (average 0.17 ng/10 mg hair). Hair opiate levels of workplace subjects ranged somewhat lower than those of clinical subjects. While all clinical hair samples contained MAM, many workplace samples did not. From workplace samples, a maximum amount of morphine likely to be present from codeine use was 0-3.7% of the codeine in the hair."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychemedics Corporation, 5832 Uplander Way, Culver City, CA 90230, USA. virginiah@psychemedics.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hill", "ForeName": "Virginia", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cairns", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chen-Chih", "Initials": "CC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaffer", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Anal Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705085", "ISSNLinking": "0146-4760"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Narcotics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "UX6OWY2V7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Codeine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Codeine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Narcotics"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Opioid-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Abuse Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workplace"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16419403", "10.1093/jat/29.7.696"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
