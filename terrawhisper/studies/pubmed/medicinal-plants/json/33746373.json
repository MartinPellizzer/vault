Soon world health organization has declared contagious coronavirus disease (a.k.a. COVID-19) as a global pandemic in the month of March 2020. Over the span of eleven months, it has rapidly spread out all over the world with total confirmed cases of ~ 41.39 M and causing a total fatality of ~1.13 M. At present, the entire mankind is facing serious threat and it is believed that COVID-19 may have been around for quite some time. Therefore, it has become imperative to forecast the global impact of COVID-19 in the near future. The present work proposes state-of-art deep learning Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models to predict the country-wise cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recovered cases and the cumulative fatalities. The Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells along with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) were developed to predict the future trends of the COVID-19. We have used publicly available data from John Hopkins University's COVID-19 database. In this work, we emphasize the importance of various factors such as age, preventive measures, and healthcare facilities, population density, etc. that play vital role in rapid spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, our forecasted results are very helpful for countries to better prepare themselves to control the pandemic."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
