Here, efforts were paid to pursue an eligible tool allowing to address the technical challenge. Being inspired by that one more proton signal is observed in <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of isoliquiritigenin than liquiritigenin when employing DMSO\u2011d<sub>6</sub> as solvent, hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX)-MS/MS was evaluated towards differentiating isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones through replacing H<sub>2</sub>O with D<sub>2</sub>O to prepare the mobile phase. As a result, differences were observed for either MS<sup>1</sup> or MS<sup>2</sup> spectrum when comparing two pairs of isomers, such as liquiritigenin vs. isoliquiritigenin and liquiritin vs. isoliquiritin, because the isomeric precursor and fragment ion species owned different amounts of hydroxyl protons and those reactive protons could be partially or completely substituted by deuterium protons at the exposure in D<sub>2</sub>O to result in n \u00d7 1.006 mass increments. Moreover, utmost four hydrogen/deuterium exchanges occurred for a single glucosyl moiety. Thereafter, HDX-MS/MS was applied to characterize the flavonoids of Snow chrysanthemum, a precious edible herbal medicine that is rich in isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones. Through paying special attention to the deuterium labeling styles of (de)protonated molecules as well as those featured fragment ions, five pairs of isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones were confirmatively differentiated, in addition to that 28 flavonoids were structurally annotated by applying those well-defined mass fragmentation rules. Hence, this study offered an in-depth insight towards the flavonoids-focused characterization of Snow chrysanthemum, and more importantly, HDX-MS/MS is a superior tool to differentiate, but not limited to, isomeric chalcones and dihydroflavones."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
