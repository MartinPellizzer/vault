This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) and auraptene (AUR) on TBI treatment.", "In total, 70 adult male Wistar rats were divided randomly into ten main groups: Sham, TBI, TBI\u2009+\u2009DMSO, TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (4\u2009mg/kg), TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (8\u2009mg/kg), TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (25\u2009mg/kg), TBI\u2009+\u2009E2 group, TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (4\u2009mg/kg) + E2 group, TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (8\u2009mg/kg) + E2 group and TBI\u2009+\u2009AUR (25\u2009mg/kg) + E2 group. Diffuse TBI was caused by the Marmarou process in male rats. The brain's tissues were harvested to check the parameters of oxidative stress and levels of inflammatory cytokine.", "The finding revealed that TBI induced a significant increase in brain edema, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidant levels [MDA and NO], and also a decrease in the brain's antioxidant biomarkers [GPx, SOD]. We also found that E2 and AUR (25\u2009mg/kg) significantly preserved the levels of these biomarkers. The combination of AUR concentrations and E2 showed that this treatment efficiently preserved the levels of these biomarkers. Furthermore, the combination of E2 and AUR (25\u2009mg/kg) c could cause the most effective synergistic interaction.", "AUR could act synergistically with E2 to treat brain injury complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarzi", "ForeName": "Zakieh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiresmaili", "ForeName": "Sedigheh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazari", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pathology and Stem Cell Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Chahkandi", "ForeName": "Mohadeseh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chitkara College of Pharmacy, Chitkara University, Chandigarh, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Sindhu", "ForeName": "Rakesh K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "0270707", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7454"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37815366", "10.1080/00207454.2023.2269478"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
