The objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacological activities of the plant relevant to the symptomatic treatment of malaria fever and other painful conditions as an initial step towards developing an effective therapy for the symptomatic management of malaria fever and relief of other painful conditions.", "Various concentrations of the aqueous extract of the root bark of this plant were evaluated for its anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activities in mice and rats. Investigation of the anti-nociceptive activities was performed using the acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction and hot-plate tests in mice and formalin-induced pain test in rats, as models of nociception. The extract was also investigated for its effect against inflammation induced by egg-albumin and pyrexia induced by yeast in rats.", "Our data showed that the aqueous extract of Nauclea latifolia root bark (50-200mg/kg p.o.) significantly (P<0.05) attenuated writhing episodes induced by acetic acid and increased the threshold for pain perception in the hot-plate test in mice, dose-dependently. The product also remarkably decreased both the acute and delayed phases of formalin-induced pain in rats and also caused a significant reduction in both yeast-induced pyrexia and egg-albumin-induced oedema in rats. These effects were produced in a dose-dependent manner.", "The results suggest the presence of biologically active principles in the extract with anti-nociceptive, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic activities that justifies its use in malaria ethnopharmacy and subsequent development for clinical application."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
