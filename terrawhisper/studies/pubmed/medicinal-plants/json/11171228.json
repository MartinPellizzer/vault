Both of these oxylipin branch pathways appear to be ubiquitous or nearly so in plants, but the relative activities of these two branches vary among plant species. In most plants examined, including Arabidopsis, product formation from either of these pathways is minimal until elicited by wounding or some other means, upon which products from both pathways, such as jasmonic acid and C(6) aldehydes and alcohols, can increase by orders of magnitude. In some plant species such as Artemisia and Jasminum spp. oxylipin product formation is heavily skewed towards allene oxide synthase products. Others such as watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) produce 10-fold higher amounts or more of hydroperoxide lyase than allene oxide synthase products. Arabidopsis and tobacco are intermediate between these extremes. Artemisia and Jasminum are also unusual in that they do not require wounding or other types of induction for high oxylipin product formation. Release of non-esterified fatty acids appears to be correlated with oxylipin formation, but phospholipase A(2) appears not to be involved with oxylipin production, at least in the case of Artemisia leaves."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40546-0091, USA. dhild@pop.uky.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hildebrand", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Afitlhile", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukushige", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Soc Trans", "NlmUniqueID": "7506897", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5127"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11171228"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
