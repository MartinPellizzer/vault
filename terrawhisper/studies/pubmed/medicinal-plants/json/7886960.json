To determine if the coat protein subunits were bound to a specific site on the viral RNA, the RNPC was treated with ribonuclease, and the remaining coat protein--RNA complexes were recovered by filter binding. A single species of RNA was isolated by this procedure and further characterized by sequencing. The RNA was mapped to nucleotides 1410-1436 of the SBMV-C genome. This region of the viral RNA was predicted to fold into a hairpin with a 4-base loop and a duplex stem of 24 nucleotides. The stability and specificity of the coat protein-RNA complex isolated from dissociated virus suggest a possible role for this interaction in the selective encapsidation of the viral RNA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37996-0845."}], "LastName": "Hacker", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7886960", "10.1006/viro.1995.1117", "S0042-6822(85)71117-8"]}}]}
