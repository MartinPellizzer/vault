Our inclusion criteria were research papers that reported evaluating any liver protection drug or drugs for preventing liver damage in people taking anti-tuberculosis treatment. Two authors independently categorised and extracted data, and appraised the stated methods of evaluating their effectiveness.", "Eighty five research articles met our inclusion criteria, carried out in China (77), India (2), Russia (4), Ukraine (2). These articles evaluated 30 distinct types of liver protection compounds categorised as herbal preparations, manufactured herbal products, combinations of vitamins and other non-herbal substances and manufactured pharmaceutical preparations. Critical appraisal of these articles showed that all were small, poorly conducted studies, measuring intermediate outcomes. Four trials that were described as randomised controlled trials were small, had short follow up, and did not meet international standards.", "There is no reliable evidence to support prescription of drugs or herbs to prevent liver damage in people on tuberculosis treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Public Health, Chongqing Medical University, No,1 Yixueyuan Road, Chongqing, PR China. liuqin81622@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garner", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Binghua", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Helen", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMC Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "100968562", "ISSNLinking": "1471-2458"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraindications"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ho MJ.
