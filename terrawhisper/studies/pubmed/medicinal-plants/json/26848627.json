Among these, compounds 2, 7, 8, 10, and 11 have not yet been described in the literature. Their chemical structures were established by means of spectroscopic data interpretation including (1)H and (13)C, HSQC, HMBC, COSY, and NOESY NMR experiments and UV, IR, and HRESIMS. The absolute configurations of the compounds were established by ECD. The isolated constituents and 10 additional quinoline alkaloids previously isolated from the roots of the plant were evaluated for their in vitro antifungal activity against the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and 10 compounds (7, 9, 11-16, 18, 21) showed growth inhibitory activity on both planktonic cells and biofilms (MIC \u2264 32 \u03bcg/mL). Their spectrum of activity against other pathogenic Candida species and their cytotoxicity against human HeLa cells were also determined. In addition, the cytological effect of the antifungal isolated compounds on the ultrastructure of C. albicans was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne , Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, 1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Cretton", "ForeName": "Sylvian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, University of Lausanne and University Hospital Center , Lausanne, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Dorsaz", "ForeName": "St\u00e9phane", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne , Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, 1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Azzollini", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne , Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, 1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Favre-Godal", "ForeName": "Quentin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, University of Lausanne , Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, 1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Marcourt", "ForeName": "Laurence", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University , G.
