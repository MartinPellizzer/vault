For measuring analgesic activity, writhing test, hot plate method and formalin test were performed and abdominal writhing was induced by intra-peritoneal injection of 0.2 ml of 3% acetic acid. While in formalin test, pain was experimentally induced by injecting 25 \u03bcl of 2.5% formalin in left hind paw. In hot plate method, pain was induced thermally by keeping the animals on a hot plate with temperature of about 51\u00b0C. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by carrageenan induced mice paw edema. For determination of antipyretic activity, pyrexia was induced by subcutaneous injection of 15% yeast. The results showed that both the extracts had significant analgesic activity (p<0.05); anti-inflammatory activity (p<0.05) and anti-pyretic activity (p<0.05). Therefore, it was concluded from this study that the extracts of Thymus linearis may be used against pain, pyrexia and inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qadir", "ForeName": "Muhammad Imran", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Parveen", "ForeName": "Amna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Khizar", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "-"}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2DDG612ED8", "NameOfSubstance": "n-hexane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antipyretics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27087102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
