In order to adverse effects of synthetic drugs, it has made a positive attitude toward alternative and complementary medicine. Ruta graveolens has a wide therapeutic application for various diseases. Aim of this study was to see the effect of this herb on Enterococcus fecalis growth. In this investigation we used standard Enterococcus fecalis. Effect of hydro-alcoholic, aqueous and methanolic extracts of Ruta graveolens on growth of bacteria has been evaluated by disc diffusion and serial dilution method and compared with eight prevalent antibiotics. None of disks with different extracts in the range of 50 to 400\u03bc/ \u03bcl show any non-growth hallo. Disks with 500\u03bcg of all type extracts in comparison with antibiotic disks did not avoid from growth of bacteria. Third test showed the growth of bacteria and ineffectiveness of various amount of extracts. It seems that this ineffectiveness is because of low antibacterial substance against the bacteria in extracts of the herb and high resistant nature of Enterococcus fecalis to antibiotics and it needs more studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Physician, Student Basij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran / Young Researchers Club, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saeidinia", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Student, Student Basij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran / Young Researchers Club, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keihanian", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "General Physician, Student Basij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Delavar", "ForeName": "Sadegh Fallah", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran / Young Researchers Club, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keihanian", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urology Resident, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Shoahad-e-Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Urology Resident, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Shoahad-e-Tajrish Hospital, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karkan", "ForeName": "Morteza Fallah", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ruta"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27592474"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
