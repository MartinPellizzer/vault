In this study, the potential application of electrospun polycaprolactone/chitosan/ the internal layer of oak fruit (Jaft) as skin scaffolds was investigated. A combination of Polycaprolactone (PCL), chitosan (CH), and the internal layer of oak fruit (Jaft) was used to incorporate mechanical properties of synthetic polymers, biological properties of natural polymers, and antibacterial activity of Jaft. Physical and morphological characteristics of prepared scaffolds were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), mechanical analysis, swelling ratio, and contact angle. Moreover, chemical and biological properties were evaluated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), chromatography, flow cytometry, DAPI staining, MTT assay, and trypan blue exclusion assay. Obtained results demonstrated that the fabricated scaffolds have good mechanical properties. Moreover, the addition of chitosan and Jaft to the PCL scaffolds improved their water absorption capacity as well as surface hydrophilicity. MTT results showed the fabricated nanofibrous scaffolds have adequate cell viability, which is higher than the cell culture plate at each time point of culture. Furthermore, SEM images of cultured scaffolds, trypan blue exclusion assay, and DAPI staining confirmed that fibroblast cells could be well-attached and proliferate on the PCL/CH/Jaft scaffolds. Results have proven that this novel bioactive scaffold has promising mechanical properties, suitable biocompatibility in vitro, and in vivo. Consequently, it could be a promising candidate for skin tissue engineering applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.
