This study aimed to evaluate their ability to inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase, two key enzymes involved in serum glucose regulation.", "Chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of 18 plants were screened for \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. Analytical-scale HPLC was subsequently used to investigate the most active extracts, where samples with low level of tannins were identified and fractionated into 96-well microplates, followed by \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase assessment of each well. High-resolution \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibition profiles constructed from these assays allowed identification of HPLC peaks correlated with \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity. The active constituents were subsequently isolated using preparative-scale HPLC and their structure was elucidated by HR-ESIMS and NMR.", "Ethanol extracts of Nepenthes mirabilis, Phyllanthus urinaria, and Kandelia candel significantly inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase with IC50 values of 32.7\u00b16.3, 39.7\u00b19.7, and 35.4\u00b113.9\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Water extracts of N. mirabilis, Phyllanthus amarus, P. urinaria, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Syzygium cumini, Rhizophora mucronata, and K. candel showed IC50 values of 3.3\u00b10.8, 34.9\u00b11.5, 14.6\u00b14.6, 5.4\u00b10.5, 20.9\u00b11.8, 3.3\u00b10.6, and 4.0\u00b10.8\u03bcg/mL, respectively. In the \u03b1-amylase inhibition assay, ethanol extracts of K. candel and Ficus racemosa showed IC50 of 7.6\u00b10.9 and 46.7\u00b123.6\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Showing low tannin constituents as seen from HPLC profiles, P. amarus and P. urinaria water extracts and F. racemosa ethanol extract were subjected to microfractionation. Only high-resolution \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition profiles of P. amarus and P. urinaria water extracts showed several active compounds, which were isolated and identified as corilagin (1), repandusinic acid A (2), and mallotinin (3). IC50 of these compounds were 1.70\u00b10.03, 6.10\u00b10.10, and 3.76\u00b10.15\u03bcM, respectively. Kinetics analysis revealed that 1 displayed a mixed type mode of inhibition with Ki and Ki' values of 2.37\u00b10.90 and 2.61\u00b10.61\u03bcM, respectively, whereas 2 and 3 competitively inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase with Ki values of 4.01\u00b10.47 and 0.65\u00b10.11\u03bcM, respectively.", "Corilagin (1), repandusinic acid A (2), and mallotinin (3) were potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors contributing significantly to the inhibitory effect observed for the water extracts of P. amarus and P. urinaria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016.
