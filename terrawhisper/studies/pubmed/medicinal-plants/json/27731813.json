The bitter gourd holds potential in improving the health of the individuals owing to its incredible versatility in phytochemistry. However, the efficacy of different parts of bitter gourd needs attention of the researchers. In the current exploration, different parts of bitter gourd were evaluated for their cholesterol lowering potential in cholesterol fed Sprague dawley rats. For the purpose, four types of bitter gourd part i.e. whole fruit, seedless fruit, seeds, and seed extracts were used and compared with placebo in hypercholesterolemic rats. In placebo, momentous increase in serum cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels was observed. All parts attenuate the cholesterol 18.79 to 40.17% triglycerides 25.97 to 37.01% and LDL 14.49 to 26.09%. However, 1% extract powder was most effective in reducing the cholesterol and triglycerides. From the present study, it is deduced that bitter gourd extract can be supplemented in food products for the management of hypercholesterolemia. However, future studies in human subjects needs to be conducted for meticulousness of the present findings."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Food Science and Technology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naz", "ForeName": "Rabia", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institue of Home Economics and Food Science, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Anjum", "ForeName": "Faqir Muhammad", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Food Science and Technology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Butt", "ForeName": "Masood Sadiq", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institue of Home Economics and Food Science, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mahr-Un-Nisa", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Momordica charantia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27731813"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
