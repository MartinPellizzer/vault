Inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2) is an essential regulator of shedding TNF-\u03b1 by trafficking with TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE). Fisetin, a flavonoid present in various fruits and plants, possesses anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, multi-combination nanoparticles Fe@Au conjugated with fisetin, iRhom2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), and TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (FN) are prepared to examine their effects on fatal septicemia-associated hepatic failure induced by Listeria monocytogenes (LM) in mice and to reveal the underlying mechanisms. After LM infection, upregulation of glutamic-oxalacetic transaminease, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, TNF-\u03b1, malondialdehyde, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , and O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> is observedcompared to FN-treated mice. The iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 signals are enhanced in vivo and in vitro, resulting in oxidative stress, which is especially associated with the activation of kupffer cells and other macrophages. Decrease in Nrf2 activation and increase of inflammation-associated regulators are also noted in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of TNF-\u03b1 derived from macrophages aggravates hepatic failure. Inversely, the processes above are restored by FN nanoparticles through the regulation of the iRhom2/TACE/TNF-\u03b1 axis and Nrf2 activation. These findings suggest that FN may be a potential approach to protect against bacterial septicemia-related diseases by targeting iRhom2."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
