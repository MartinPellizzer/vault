Massive propagation of shoots and roots was achieved by the temporary immersion system (TIS), morphogenesis and maintenance of cell suspensions by standard in vitro culture techniques. Oleanolic acid (OA), rutin, chlorogenic acid (CA) and scopoletin content in aerial parts of wild growing Fabiana imbricata plants as well as in plantlets regenerated in vitro, callus cultures, cell suspensions and biomass, obtained by the TIS system was assessed by HPLC. On a dry weight basis, the OA content in the aerial parts of the plant ranged between 2.26 and 3.47% while in vitro plantlets, callus and root cultures presented values ranging from not detected up to 0.14%. The rutin content of the samples presented a similar trend with maxima between 0.99 and 3.35% for the aerial parts of the plants to 0.02 to 0.20% for plantlets, 0.12% for cell suspensions and 0.28% for callus. Rutin was not detected in the roots grown by the TIS principle. The CA and scopoletin content in the aerial parts of F. imbricata ranged between 0.22-1.15 and < 0.01-0.55%, respectively. In the plantlets, the concentration of CA was 0.29 to 1.48% with scopoletin in the range 0.09 to 0.64% while in the callus sample, the CA and scopoletin content were 0.46 and 0.66%, respectively. A very different result was found in roots grown by TIS, where both OA and rutin were not detected and its main secondary metabolite, scopoletin was found between a range of 0.99 and 1.41% with CA between of 0.11 and 0.42%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad de Talca, Instituto de Qu\u00edmica de Recursos Naturales, Laboratorio de Productos Naturales, Casilla 747, Talca, Chile. schmeda@utalca.cl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schmeda-Hirschmann", "ForeName": "Guillermo", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jordan", "ForeName": "Miguel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gerth", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wilken", "ForeName": "Dirk", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hormazabal", "ForeName": "Emilio", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tapia", "ForeName": "Alejandro A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KLF1HS0SXJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopoletin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Scopoletin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15018052", "10.1515/znc-2004-1-211"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
