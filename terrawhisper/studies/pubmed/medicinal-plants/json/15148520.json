Human epidermal melanocytes were treated with MSF and examined for adhesion to bovine serum fibronectin-coated culture dishes. Control and treated cells were also examined for migration into micropore filters coated with the same protein. Compared with control, MSF-treated melanocytes adhered to the dishes more easily and migrated into the filters in a dose-dependent manner. MSF at a dose of more than 200 micro g/ml did not increase melanocyte adhesion and migration accordingly. With the exception of MSF 10 micro g/ml, at every concentration of MSF there were significant differences between treated and untreated melanocytes (p < 0.01) when the adhesion test was studied. Regarding migration, even at a concentration of MSF 10 micro g/ml, obviously increased cell numbers were found compared with MSF untreated melanocytes (p < 0.01). MSF promoted melanocyte adhesion and migration; this could explain, in part, the capacity of MSF to regulate melanocyte function in vitiligo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, First Hospital, Institute of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China. moukuanhou@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mou", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X Q", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Z L", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7909595", "ISSNLinking": "0379-0355"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Melanocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15148520", "10.1358/mf.2004.26.3.809721", "809721"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
