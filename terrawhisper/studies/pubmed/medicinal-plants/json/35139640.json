Plant molecular farming (PMF) employs plants as bioreactors for the production of pharmaceuticals. Now PMF has been used to produce antibodies, vaccines, and medicinal proteins, but it has not been well-studied for production of nutraceuticals and functional food. In this perspective, we extend the concept of PMF, present an updated overview of PMF for functional food development, including the progress, problem, and strategy, and then speculate how to use the PMF strategy to produce functional foods, especially with four major staple food crops (rice, wheat, maize, and soybean). Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of PMF on functional food production in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
