Following metabolic activation to the reactive carbocation intermediate, ME can bind covalently to DNA, which is directly associated with its carcinogenicity. In this work, a non-invasive approach to determine ME exposure was established by monitoring the urinary N<sup>6</sup>-(methylisoeugenol-3'-yl)-2'-deoxyadenosine (ME-dA) adduct. The developed method entails liquid-liquid extraction enrichment of urinary ME-dA, incorporation of deuterated ME-dA as an internal standard, and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry. Male rats (10-12 weeks, 180-200 g) were treated (p.o.) with ME, and ME-dA was excreted in urine in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The non-invasive approach enabled us to successfully determine exposure to ME-containing herbs and spices. These results suggest that ME-dA can potentially serve as an effective biomarker of ME exposure in rats. It is expected that the developed approach of detecting urinary ME-dA will facilitate the investigation of ME carcinogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Yukun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Saide", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0340-0275"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University , Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province and Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Adducts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyadenosines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29T9VA6R7M", "NameOfSubstance": "methyleugenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3T8H1794QW", "NameOfSubstance": "Eugenol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Adducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyadenosines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "toxicity", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Eugenol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29328669", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b05186"]}}]}
