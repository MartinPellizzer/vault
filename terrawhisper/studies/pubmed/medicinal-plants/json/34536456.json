In order to reduce the dependence on wild populations of the species, we aim to establish in vitro culture system that can produce Rubiaceae-type cyclopeptides (RAs) and quinones. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation of stem segments of in vitro grown R. yunnanensis plants using four A. rhizogenes strains was studied and transformation conditions were optimized. Hairy roots appeared with the highest frequency (68.89%) when stem segments (with leaves) without pre-culture were immersed in A. rhizogenes A4 strain bacterial suspension for 30\u00a0min, co-cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium in the dark for three days, and afterwards incubated in darkness. PCR analysis of rolB and rolC genes confirmed transformed nature of six hairy root clones. The hairy roots grew rapidly, especially showing the highest accumulation of biomass in MS liquid medium compared to in vitro grown plants and calli. Histological observation of hairy root revealed anatomical difference in vascular cylinder, where the cells exhibited high mitotic activity characterized by vigorous growth. The UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that the amount of RAs in the hairy roots grown in \u00bdMS liquid medium (4.611\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW) was higher than that in in vitro grown plants (0.331 and 4.096\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW for shoots and roots respectively) and calli (1.082\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW), but still far lower than that in the roots of seed-borne plants (80.296\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW). However, the hairy roots accumulated high level of quinones (2320.923 and 5067.801\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW for MS and \u00bdMS liquid media respectively), of the same order of magnitude as the roots of seed-borne plants (7409.973\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW). Hairy root culture of R. yunnanensis, with high accumulation of biomass and production of quinones, may offer an attractive perspective for the production of the RAs and quinones that could be further optimized for pharmaceutical use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
