It has been evidently found for its effectiveness in ethanomedicinal usage, which can also emerge as one of the most promising sources for nutraceuticals.", "This study aims to examine the phytochemistry of the whole crude extract of T. coadunata for the first time with evaluation of antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activity.", "High Resolution Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis (HR-LCMS) was performed for confirming the presence of biologically active constituents in the extract of T. coadunata followed by antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activity.", "With the detailed Mass spectra data, absorbance spectra and retention times, chemical composition of T. coadunata holds a diverse group of bioactive/chemical components such as sugars, sugar alcohol, flavonoids, terpenoids and phenolics. The results for antioxidant activity showed that T. coadunata crude extract had higher scavenging potential against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals than H2O2 molecules, which was followed by positive antibacterial activity against several pathogenic bacteria like Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi.", "The ethanolic extract of T. coadunata showed favorable antiproliferation activity against three leukemic (KG1, MOLT-3 and K-562) cells in a dose dependent manner, especially for KG1 42.850\u00b11.24\u03bcg/ml.", "This study has provided a better understanding of the presence of biologically active phytochemical constituents in the extract of T. coadunata, which can be the reason for its bioactive potential. Moreover, T. coadunata has significant anticancer activities against human leukemic cancer cell lines, indicating it as a potential anticancer agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bapalal Vaidya Botanical Research Centre, Department of Biosciences, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Reddy", "ForeName": "Mandadi N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Adnan", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alreshidi", "ForeName": "Mousa M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Science, University of Ha'il, Ha'il, PO Box 2440, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bapalal Vaidya Botanical Research Centre, Department of Biosciences, Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Mitesh", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhi"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Shigella flexneri"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32188388", "10.2174/1871520620666200318101938", "ACAMC-EPUB-105336"]}}]}
