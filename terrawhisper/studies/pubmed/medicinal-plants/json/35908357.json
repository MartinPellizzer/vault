In the present study, a T. baccata cell suspension culture was exposed to white light and 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid (AIP), a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) inhibitor, and the effects of this treatment on cell growth, PAL activity, total phenol content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), taxane production and the expression of some key taxane biosynthetic genes (DXS, GGPPS, T13OH, BAPT, DBTNBT) as well as the PAL were studied. Light reduced cell growth, whereas AIP slightly improved it. Light increased PAL activity up to 2.7-fold relative to darkness. The highest TPC (24.89\u00a0mg GAE/g DW) and TFC (66.94\u00a0mg RUE/g DW) were observed in cultures treated with light and AIP. Light treatment also resulted in the maximum content of total taxanes (154.78\u00a0\u03bcg/g DW), increasing extracellular paclitaxel and cephalomannin (3.3-fold) and intracellular 10-deacetyl paclitaxel (2.5-fold). Light significantly increased the expression level of PAL, DBTNBT, BAPT, and T13\u03b1OH genes, whereas it had no effect on the expression of DXS, a gene active at the beginning of the taxane biosynthetic pathway. AIP had no significant effect on the expression of the target genes. In conclusion, the light-induced activation of PAL transcription and altered expression of relevant biosynthetic genes reduced cell growth and increased the content of total phenolic compounds and taxanes. These findings can be applied to improve taxane production in controlled cultures and bioreactors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
