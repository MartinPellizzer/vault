In this article, the studies about plant's functional genes at home and abroad was introduced in three aspects: the pattern plants (rice, thaliana, etc.), the main technologic strategy (gene expression differentia, sequential tag of gene expression, DNA microarray technique and gene expression sequential analysis) and bio-informative method (comparative genomics). The current status of researches involving biosynthesis genes of flavonoids compounds and taxol, and the plant P450 genes were introduced. And the study of dendrobium functional genes conducted in authors' lab was also reviewed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Basic Medicine, Guangzhou TCM University. wxyaby@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xiao-yong", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jie-feng", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "36"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15768888"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
