The effects of 4-day bilateral intrahippocampal (i.h.) infusions of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), H-89 as a protein kinase AII inhibitor, auraptene/H-89, resveratrol/H-89, and curcumin/H-89 were investigated on spatial memory acquisition in MWM. The rats were trained for 4 days; each day included one block of four trials. Post-training probe tests were performed on day 5 in acquisition test. For retention assessments, different animals were trained for 4 days and then infused (i.h.) with either DMSO, H-89, auraptene/H-89, resveratrol/H-89, or curcumin/H-89. The retention test was performed 48 h after the last training trial. The bilateral infusion of H-89 led to a significant impairment in spatial memory in acquisition and retention tests accompanied with a significant decrease in expressions of cAMP response-element binding (CREB) and pCREB proteins in hippocampus. Resveratrol and curcumin reversed the H-89-induced spatial memory acquisition and retention impairments with significant increases in both CREB and pCREB proteins expressions compared to H-89-treated animals. Auraptene showed significant effects in reversing H-89-induced impairments in spatial memory retention but not spatial memory acquisition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
