The rGO/ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite was characterized by scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The experimental parameters affecting the efficiency of magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) including the amount of material, extraction time, pH, temperature, desorption solvents, desorption time, and desorption solvent volume were investigated respectively. With the developed method, good linearity was observed in the range of 0.05-500\u202fng/mL with the correlation coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) between 0.9978 and 0.9993. The limits of detection (S/N\u202f=\u202f3) and limits of quantification (S/N\u202f=\u202f10) were achieved at 0.01-0.02\u202fng/mL and 0.05\u202fng/mL, respectively. The enrichment factors were calculated as the range of 241-288. Using rGO/ZnFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanocomposite as the sorbent, the developed MSPE followed by HPLC analysis, was applied to analysis of estrogens in river water, soil and fish samples. The method has the potential application in the extraction and preconcentration ultra trace compounds in complex matrices, such as environmental and biological samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
