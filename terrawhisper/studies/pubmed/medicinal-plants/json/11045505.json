The performance of eight commercially available SPME fibres was compared to evaluate the recoveries of some characteristic components with different polarities and structures present in the headspace of four aromatic and medicinal plants: rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) and valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.). The relative concentration capacity of each fibre on the same components of each plant was also determined by comparing their abundance with that obtained by classical static-headspace GC. The partition coefficient, K1, between the headspace gaseous phase and SPME polymeric coating, and the relative concentration factors, of some of the characteristic components of the plant investigated dissolved in dibutyl phtalate, were also determined, under rigorously standardised analysis conditions. The results showed that the most effective fibres were those consisting of two components, i.e., a liquid phase (polydimethylsiloxane) and a porous solid (carboxen or divinylbenzene, or both)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienza e Tecnologia del Farmaco, Turin, Italy. bicchi@pharm.unito.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bicchi", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Drigo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rubiolo", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11045505", "10.1016/s0021-9673(00)00231-4", "S0021-9673(00)00231-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
