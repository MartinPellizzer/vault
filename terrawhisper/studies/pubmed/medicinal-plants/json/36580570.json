Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and X-ray crystallography. Three compounds showed excellent inhibitory activities on <i>\u03b1</i>-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 54.48 to 240.88\u2009<i>\u03bc</i>M, better than that of the positive control (acarbose, IC<sub>50</sub> = 590.94\u2009<i>\u03bc</i>M). Moreover, compounds <b>3</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>15</b> presented moderate inhibitory activities against butyrylcholinesterase. Compound <b>17</b> exhibited potent PTP1B inhibitory activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 179.45\u2009\u03bcM. Representative active compounds were performed for the molecular docking study. Herein, we described the isolation, structure elucidation, the inhibitory effects on three enzymes, and molecular docking of the isolates from the title plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
