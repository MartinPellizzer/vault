Morphological and molecular analyses confirmed the identity of CL-1. An ethyl acetate extract (CL-E) from its fermentation broth was subjected to UPLC-HRMS and GNPS molecular networking. The analysis revealed a diverse array of secondary metabolites, including\u00a011 terpenes, 7\u00a0flavonoids, 10\u00a0cinnamic acid derivatives, 6\u00a0oligopeptides, and 9\u00a0fatty acids, as verified by LC-MS/MS. Notably, CL-E exhibited significant in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, \u00a0molecular docking studies predicted favorable binding interactions of key compounds 1\u00a0within CL-E with the NLRP3 inflammasome (PDB ID: 6NPY). These findings suggest T.\u00a0versicolor\u00a0CL-1 as a promising source of natural anti-inflammatory agents and unveil R.\u00a0roxburghii\u00a0as a potential reservoir for discovering novel bioactive metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Wiley\u2010VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Medical
