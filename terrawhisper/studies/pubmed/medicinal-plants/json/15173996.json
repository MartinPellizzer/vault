Such compounds are likely to afford protection from cytotoxic, genotoxic and metabolic actions of environmental toxicant thereby reducing the risk for cancer. The present study reports the anticarcinogenic activity of Swertia chirata Buch.Ham, an Indian medicinal plant. All the four detoxification enzymes studied viz, GST, GPx, SOD and CAT were found to be activated in different degrees following treatment with infusion of Swertia chirata, its crude extract and a purified 'Amarogentin' rich extract. The activation of the enzymes was accompanied by significant reduction in lipid peroxidation and inhibition of incidence as well as multiplicity of Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced papillomas. The effect of S.chirata on apoptosis and cell proliferation was also studied in mice skin exposed to DMBA. Both the crude and purified extracts significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. This is the fi rst report of its kind and the observation suggests the chemopreventive potential of Swertia chirata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cancer Chemoprevention, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Prosenjit", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mandal", "ForeName": "Suvra", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Ashes", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Prabhas C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Sukta", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Papilloma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swertia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15173996", "10.1002/ptr.1436"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
