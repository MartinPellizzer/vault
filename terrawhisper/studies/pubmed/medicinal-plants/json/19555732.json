Aqueous extract of Garlip a, polyherbal drug was administered orally (200 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. The different doses of Garlip on blood glucose and plasma insulin in diabetic rats were studied and the levels of lipid peroxides (TBARS and Hydroperoxide) and tissue lipids (cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipids and free fatty acids) were also estimated in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats. The effects were compared with tolbutamide. Treatment with Garlip and tolbutamide resulted in a significant reduction of blood glucose and increase in plasma insulin. Garlip also resulted in a significant decrease in tissue lipids and lipid peroxide formation. The effect produced by Garlip was comparable with that of tolbutamide. The decreased lipid peroxides and tissue lipids clearly showed the antihyperlipidemic and antiperoxidative effect of Garlip apart from its antidiabetic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Biotechnology, Muthayammal College of Arts and Sciences, Kakkaveri, Rasipuram, Namakkal, Tamilnadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharmila Banu", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murugesan", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19555732", "10.1016/j.fct.2009.06.027", "S0278-6915(09)00302-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
