In this study, a series of diaryl urea derivatives has been designed and synthesized based on clinical candidate gedatolisib (6aa), and most of the newly synthesized derivatives showed kinase inhibitory and antiproliferative activities within nanomolar and submicromolar level, respectively. The terminal l-prolineamide substituted derivative 6\u00a0ab showed 8.6-fold more potent PI3K\u03b1 inhibitory activity (0.7\u00a0nM) and 4.6-fold more potent antiproliferative effect against HCT116\u00a0cell lines (0.11\u00a0\u03bcM) compared with control 6aa. The potential antitumor mechanism and efficacy of 6\u00a0ab in HCT116 xenograft models have also been evaluated, and found 6\u00a0ab showed comparable in\u00a0vivo antitumor activity with 6aa. The safety investigations revealed that compound 6\u00a0ab exhibited more safer profiles in the selectivity of liver cells (selectivity index: >6.6 vs 1.85) and blood glucose regulation than 6aa. In addition, the in\u00a0vitro stability assays also indicated our developed compound 6\u00a0ab possessed good metabolic stabilities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
