However, studies documenting the effect of <i>O</i>. <i>sanctum</i> and <i>A. vera</i> in treating gingivitis are rare.", "The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two herbal mouthwashes in comparison with chlorhexidine mouthwash on gingivitis.", "A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, wherein sixty patients were randomly allocated into three study groups. (1) <i>O</i>. <i>sanctum</i> mouthwash (<i>n</i> = 20) (2) <i>A. vera</i> mouthwash (<i>n</i> = 20) and (3) Chlorhexidine mouthwash (<i>n</i> = 20). All groups were treated with scaling and asked to rinse with respective mouthwashes twice daily for 1 month. Clinical parameters such as plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and sulcus bleeding index (BI) were recorded at baseline, after 15 days and after 30 days, respectively.", "Results of the study showed that <i>O</i>. <i>sanctum</i>, <i>A. vera</i> and chlorhexidine are equally effective in reducing plaque, gingival, and bleeding indices at 30-day interval. However, no significant reductions in PI, GI and BI in 15-day interval in group 1 and group 2 when compared with chlorhexidine were evident.", "The results in the present study indicate that <i>O</i>. <i>sanctum</i> and <i>A. vera</i> may prove to be as effective as chlorhexidine mouthwash in its ability in reducing all the three indices by reducing plaque accumulation, gingival inflammation and bleeding when used in the long-term follow-up."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2019 AYU (An International Quarterly Journal of Research in Ayurveda)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics and Implantology, Vishnu Dental College, Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Penmetsa", "ForeName": "Gautami S", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Periodontics and Implantology, Vishnu Dental College, Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Pitta", "ForeName": "Sudha Rani", "Initials": "SR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Ayu", "NlmUniqueID": "7605807", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8520"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Losche WJ.
