In this study, we examined the effect of PFE on antigen-specific antibody and on cytokine production. Mice were immunized three times (weekly) with sugi basic protein (SBP), a major allergen of Japanese cedar pollen, in alum adjuvant. PFE was injected intraperitoneally into mice on day 2 before and on the day of each immunization with SBP in alum adjuvant. Serum anti-SBP IgE and IgG 1 antibody levels were significantly suppressed in mice injected with PFE. Furthermore, the production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10 by SBP-stimulated splenocyses also decreased in PFE-injected mice in a dose-dependent manner. However, PFE had no effect on either the serum anti-SBP IgG 2 a antibody levels or on interferon (INF)-gamma production by splenocytes. When splenocytes were stimulated with concanavalin A, there was no difference in cytokine production between mice injected with PFE and control mice injected with vehicle. SBP-specific T cell line established in the presence of PFE from the lymph node cells of mice immunized with SBP showed reduced IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 production compared with that established in the absence of PFE. In contrast, comparable levels of IFN-gamma production were observed between these two T cell lines. These data suggest that PFE down-regulates Th 2-type cytokine production and prevents the Th 1/Th 2 balance from polarizing toward Th 2-type immune responses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fujisaki Institute, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc."}], "LastName": "Ishihara", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okamoto", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Masaki", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kohno", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanimoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikegami", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurimoto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Arerugi", "NlmUniqueID": "0241212", "ISSNLinking": "0021-4884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10355148"]}}]}
