In continuation of our on-going work devoted to the valorisation of medicinal and aromatic plants from Tlemcen Province (North-Western Algeria), cones have. been harvested in eight locations (coastal township and highlands) and 40 oil samples have been isolated by hydrodistillation. Six oil samples were analyzed by a combination of chromatographic [GC(Retention indices)] and spectroscopic techniques (GC-MS, \"C NMR). Then, the remaining 34 oil samples. were analyzed by [GC(RI)] and 13C NMR and the 40 compositions were submitted to statistical analysis. Essential oil yields varied substantially from sample to sample (0.17 to 1.13%, w/w). The cone oils consisted mainly of monoterpenes, with \u03b1-pinene (47.1-73.6%) and limonene (6.5-21.9%) being the main components. (E)--Caryophyllene and germacrene D were the major sesquiterpenes. Diterpenes, (Z) and (E)-biformene were identified for the first time-in T. articulata essential oil. PCA analysis of the data allowed the distinction of two groups, the second group being sub-divided into two sub-groups. Groups and sub-groups were differentiated with respect to their contents of a-pinene and limonene and, to a lesser extent, of sesquiterpenes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boussaid", "ForeName": "Maghnia", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bekhethi", "ForeName": "Chahrazed", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atik-Bekkara", "ForeName": "Fewzia", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Paoli", "ForeName": "Mathieu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casanova", "ForeName": "Joseph", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tomi", "ForeName": "Felix", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Commun", "NlmUniqueID": "101477873", "ISSNLinking": "1555-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cupressaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30725583"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
