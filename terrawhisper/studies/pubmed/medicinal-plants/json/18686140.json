The only symptomatic treatment proven effective to date is the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to augment surviving cholinergic activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate cholinesterase inhibitory activity of mangroves as an alternative medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. About nine mangrove plants, which were used as folk medicine in tropical countries, were collected from Parangipettai, Vellar estuary, Tamilnadu, India. Nile Tilapia muscle homogenate was used as source of enzyme. Inhibitory effect of methanolic leaf extract was assessed under in vitro condition by incubating various concentration of the extract with total cholinesterase and butyryl cholinesterase and assessing their residual activities by Ellman's colorimetric method. The results showed that of the nine plants screened Rhizophora lamarckii, Suaeda monica, Avicennia officinalis and Sesuvium portulacastrum showed 50% inhibitory activity to both TChE and BChE at concentrations less than 2 mg/mL when compared to other plant extracts, which was comparable to the standard drug Donepezil. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of alkaloids in high concentration which might be correlated to its cholinesterase inhibitory activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Alagappa University, Karaikudi, 630 003, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suganthy", "ForeName": "Natarajan", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pandian", "ForeName": "Shanmugiahthevar Karutha", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Kasi Pandima", "Initials": "KP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101150203", "ISSNLinking": "1475-6366"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aizoaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Avicennia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indian Ocean"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizophoraceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18686140", "10.1080/14756360802334719", "901330335"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
