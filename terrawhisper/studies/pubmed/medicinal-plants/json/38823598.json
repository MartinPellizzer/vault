Its ethanolic root extract has been postulated for anthelminthic activities which has a potential for development for human gnathostomiasis drug. To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile, liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of didehydrostemofoline in rats' plasma was developed and validated. The chromatographic separation was performed on a C<sub>18</sub> column using 1\u00a0mM ammonium acetate in water and methanol (50:50, v/v). Tetrahydropalmatine was used as an internal standard. The multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for quantitative analysis. The validated method showed good sensitivity, linearity, precision, and accuracy. The results of stability showed that didehydrostemofoline was stable in the extracted samples in auto-sampler for 24\u00a0h and in the plasma samples under room temperature for 24\u00a0h, -20\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0month, and after three freeze-thaw processes. The developed method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of didehydrostemofoline after oral administration of S. collinsiae root extract. Didehydrostemofoline was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The time to peak drug concentration was 1.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62\u00a0h with maximum drug concentration of 1152.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0271.18\u00a0ng/mL. Didehydrostemofoline was rapidly eliminated from the body with terminal half-life of 1.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50\u00a0h. Calculated drug clearance of didehydrostemofoline was 96.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.51\u00a0L/h and volume of distribution was 260.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a096.81\u00a0L. The present study provided useful data for understanding drug disposition in the body with dynamic time-course which could be beneficial for further clinical trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
