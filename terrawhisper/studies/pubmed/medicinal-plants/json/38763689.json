The authenticity of tuna is required to protect both consumers and tuna stocks. Given this, the study is designed to identify species-specific peptides for distinguishing three commercial tropical tuna species. The peptides derived from trypsin digestion were separated and detected using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Venn analysis showed that there were differences in peptide composition among the three tested tuna species. The biological specificity screening through the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (NCBI BLAST) revealed that 93 peptides could serve as potential species-specific peptides. Finally, the detection specificity of species-specific peptides of raw meats and processed products was carried out by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode based on a Q-Trap mass spectrometer. The results showed that three, one and two peptides of Katsuwonus pelamis, Thunnus obesus and Thunnus albacores, respectively could serve as species-specific peptides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
