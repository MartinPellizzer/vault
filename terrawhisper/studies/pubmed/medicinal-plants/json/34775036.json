It is widely used in clinical treatment and disease prevention in China, India and other regions. Modern studies have reported the phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity and the animal toxicity of Zanthoxylum armatum DC, and the damage of genetic material has been observed in plants, but the detailed mechanism has not been explored. Besides, the toxicity of normal mammalian cells has not been evaluated.", "To evaluate the effects and underlying mechanism of genetic material damage in BRL 3A cells induced by Zanthoxylum armatum DC.", "Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry was used for identification of compounds in methanol extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC. BRL 3A cells were incubated with different concentrations of methanol extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC (24\u00a0h). The cytotoxicity of extract was assessed with cell viability, LDH release rate, and ROS production. The damage of genetic material was assessed with OTM value of comet cells, cell cycle and the expression levels of p-ATM, p- Chk2, Cdc25A, and CDK2.", "Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry investigation revealed the presence of compounds belonging to flavonoid, fatty acid and alkaloid groups. The viability of BRL 3A cells was reduced in a time-dose dependent manner treated by methanol extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC. It increased LDH release rate and ROS production, activated the DNA double strand damage marker of \u03b3H2AX and produced comet cells. In addition, methanol extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC caused ATM-mediated DNA damage, further phosphorylated Chk2, inhibited cell cycle related proteins, and arrested the G1/S cycle.", "Methanol extract of Zanthoxylum armatum DC induces DNA damage and further leads G1/S cell cycle arrest by triggering oxidative stress in the BRL 3A cells.
