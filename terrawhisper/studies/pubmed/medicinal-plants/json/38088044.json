The infusion of its leaves has been used, in folk medicine of several South American countries, as anti-inflammatory and hypoglycaemic agent. In the present study, the infusion of leaves from <i>J. floribunda</i> was obtained and its chemical composition was determined by UHPLC-MS associated with molecular network allowing the annotation of flavonoids, sesquiterpene lactones, coumarins, and chlorogenic acid derivatives. Besides, <i>in vitro</i> elastase activity assay was carried out with the infusion. As observed, elastase was inhibited at concentrations ranging from 15 to 240\u2009\u00b5g/mL, reaching to 71% of inhibition at the maximum of evaluated concentration. Given that species of plants are promising sources for the discovery of new drugs, these results corroborate the infusion of <i>J. floribunda</i> as a potential source of bioactive compounds for the discovery of new inhibitors for elastase, besides its ethnopharmacological aspects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Ribeiro", "ForeName": "Andreza Aparecida", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of the South of Minas Gerais - IFSULDEMINAS, Campus Inconfidentes, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Jorge Alexandre Nogueira", "Initials": "JAN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Salem", "ForeName": "Paula Pio de Oliveira", "Initials": "PPO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1981-834X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Physics, Exact, Natural and Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Espirito Santo - UFES, Alegre, Espirito Santo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Mario Ferreira Concei\u00e7\u00e3o", "Initials": "MFC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Bueno", "ForeName": "Paula Carolina Pires", "Initials": "PCP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Human and Natural Sciences, Federal University of ABC - UFABC, Santo Andre, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lago", "ForeName": "Jo\u00e3o Henrique Ghilardi", "Initials": "JHG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9129-4734"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dias", "ForeName": "Danielle Ferreira", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2274-4919"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Chagas de Paula", "ForeName": "Daniela Aparecida", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9221-9867"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Phytochemistry and Medicinal Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Alfenas - UNIFAL, Alfenas, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Marisi Gomes", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38088044", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2293149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
