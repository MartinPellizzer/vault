From a macroperspective, the MaxEnt model indicated that countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, such as China, Egypt, and Libya, were particularly suitable for growth of <i>C. salsa</i> from ancient times (Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene) to the future (2050 and 2070). The Jackknife test revealed that precipitation is an important ecological factor that affects <i>C. salsa</i>'s distribution. From a microperspective, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data showed that the soil microbial communities of three ecotypes (desert-steppe, grassland, and gravel-desert) were significantly different (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Core microbiome analysis demonstrated that the bacterial genera <i>Arthrobacter</i>, <i>Sphingomonas</i>, and <i>Bacillus</i> were enriched core taxa of <i>C. salsa</i>. LEfSe and random forest were used to excavate the <i>Gillisia</i> (desert-steppe), <i>Flavisolibacter</i> (grassland), and <i>Variibacter</i> (gravel-desert) as biomarkers that can distinguish among microbial communities from the three ecotypes. The prediction profile showed that the metabolic function of the microbial community was enriched in metabolic pathways and environmental information processing. Correlation analyses revealed that the altitude, precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), mean diurnal range (bio2), and mean temperature of the warmest quarter (bio10) were important ecological factors that affect the composition of soil microbial communities. This work provided new insights into the regulatory relationship among the suitable distribution of <i>C. salsa</i>, soil microbial communities, and ecological drivers. Moreover, it deepened the understanding of the interaction between desert plants and ecological factors in arid environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9169-3356"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Research Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection, Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu, Sichuan 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Pei", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Research Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection, Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Yu-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Research Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection, Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bao-Li", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Science, Sichuan Agriculture University, Ya'an, Sichuan 625014, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Biotechnology & Microbiology, University of Peshawar, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Bashir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6822-0603"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Research Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Protection, Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lin-Fang", "Initials": "LF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32658471", "10.1021/acs.jafc.0c01568"]}}]}
