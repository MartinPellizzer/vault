We have reviewed the records of 29 cases reported to the Kentucky Regional Poison Center (KRPC) over a 7-y period during which time physostigmine was not recommended by the Center to assess the results of conservative therapy. 28/29 cases represented intentional abuse; 26/29 were males and the mean age for the group was 18.9 y (range 16 mo to 39 y). The reported ingested amounts ranged from a few to 1/2-cup of seeds. Typical mild anticholinergic symptoms including mydriasis, tachycardia, flushing, hallucinations, and both agitated behavior and lethargy were observed. No patient had life-threatening symptoms. All cases were referred to the Emergency Department, although only 20 complied. Of these, 17 were admitted for stays of 1-3 d (mean 1.8). Seventeen patients received activated charcoal on recommendation of the KRPC. Three patients with hallucinations received 1 or more doses of valium or haloperidol for sedation. All patients recovered uneventfully. We conclude that conservative treatment of jimsonweed ingestion is safe and adequate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kentucky Regional Poison Control Center, Kosair Children's Hospital, Louisville 40232-5070."}], "LastName": "Rodgers", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Von Kanel", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hallucinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Datura stramonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hallucinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8434447"]}}]}
