Later on, they were used for the treatment of podagra. The treatment was introduced by the ancient Greek physicians and passed on to the Byzantine and Arabian physicians to endure until nowadays. The first plant was most probably named \"Medea\" from the notorious Colchican witch. As the most common member of the family blossoms in autumn, the plant was named Colchicum autumnale. Various nominations were also used, such as Ephemeron, Hermodactyl, Anima articulorum and Surugen. Our article discusses them, while at the same time presents the most notable authorities who have used Colchicum plants in herbal medicine and toxicology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Institute of History of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University, Lyon, France."}], "LastName": "Tsoucalas", "ForeName": "Gregory", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Engineering Unit, First Dept. of Cardiology, Hippokration Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece."}], "LastName": "Papaioannou", "ForeName": "Theodoros", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, Greece."}], "LastName": "Panayiotakopoulos", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, Medical School, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece."}], "LastName": "Saridaki", "ForeName": "Zenia", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Athens General Hospital \"G.
