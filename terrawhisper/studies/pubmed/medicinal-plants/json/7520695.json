It was observed that the binding affinity of tetrahydrofolate polyglutamates for these proteins continuously increased with increasing number of glutamates up to six residues. It was also established that, once bound to the proteins, tetrahydrofolate, a very O2-sensitive molecule, was protected from oxidative degradation. The dissociation constants (Kd) of H4PteGlu5, the most predominant form of polyglutamate in the mitochondria, were approximately 0.5 microM for both T-protein and SHMT, whereas the Kd values of CH2-H4PteGlu5 were higher, 2.7 and 7 microM respectively. In a matrix extract from pea leaf mitochondria, the maximal activity of the glycine-cleavage system was about 2.5 times higher than the maximal activity of SHMT. This resulted in a permanent disequilibrium of the SHMT-catalysed reaction which was therefore driven toward the production of serine and H4PteGlun, the thermodynamically unfavourable direction. Indeed, measurements of the steady-state ratio of CH2-H4PteGlun/H4PteGlun (n = 1 or n = 5) during the course of glycine oxidation demonstrated that the methylene form accounted for 65-80% of the folate pool. This indicates that, in our in vitro experiments, CH2-H4PteGlun with long polyglutamate chains accumulated in the bulk medium. This observation suggests that, in these in vitro experiments at least, there was no channelling of CH2-H4PteGlu5 between the T-protein and SHMT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CEA, Physiologie Cellulaire V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, CNRS, Grenoble, France."}], "LastName": "Rebeille", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neuburger", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Douce", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem J", "NlmUniqueID": "2984726R", "ISSNLinking": "0264-6021"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrahydrofolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25513-46-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyglutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.4.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyglutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrahydrofolates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochem J. 1993 Jun 1;292 ( Pt 2):425-30", "ArticleIdList": ["8503876"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1992 Jul 5;267(19):13528-34", "ArticleIdList": ["1618853"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1989 Jan 10;28(1):106-14", "ArticleIdList": ["2706237"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1989 Mar;269(2):371-80", "ArticleIdList": ["2645826"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Cell Biochem. 1981 Sep 25;39:331-45", "ArticleIdList": ["6458763"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Biochem. 1993 Oct 1;217(1):377-86", "ArticleIdList": ["8223576"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1982 Jul;216(2):551-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6810760"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1966 Apr;5(4):1438-43", "ArticleIdList": ["5958219"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1966 Dec 25;241(24):5851-63", "ArticleIdList": ["5954363"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1992 May 5;267(13):9289-93", "ArticleIdList": ["1577761"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Cell Biochem. 1981 Aug 11;38 Spec No(Pt 1):19-48", "ArticleIdList": ["7027025"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1988 Oct 1;255(1):169-78", "ArticleIdList": ["3143355"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1990 Oct;94(2):833-9", "ArticleIdList": ["16667785"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1985 Dec 5;260(28):14925-31", "ArticleIdList": ["4066660"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1990 Jul 25;265(21):12149-55", "ArticleIdList": ["2373684"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7520695", "PMC1137213", "10.1042/bj3020223"]}}]}
