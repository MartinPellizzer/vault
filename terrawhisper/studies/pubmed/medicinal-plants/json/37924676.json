However, information related to ultrastructural evidence of Nano-scale exosomes-multivesicular bodies and autophagic pathway in the high endothelial cells (HECs) of the small intestine in laying birds is still ambiguous. In present study, the HECs secreted the early endosome (ee), late endosome (le) and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in the lamina propria of layer small intestine was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Besides that, in the cytoplasm of HECs showed many autophagosomes were directly associated with lysosomes and mitochondria. Further, the immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence results showed that, the immunoreactivity and immuno-signaling of Nano-scale exosome related proteins, cluster of differentiation (CD63) and tumor susceptibility gene (TSG101), and autophagic related proteins, autophagic related gene (ATG7) and microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3) were strong positive expression in the lamina propria of small intestine. These results prove that HECs play a well-known immunological role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. In summary, these findings indicate that the small intestine's HECs have developed an innovative way of communication."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
