The present study was conducted to investigate optimal conditions for the extraction of the compound by supercritical fluid extraction from the roots of Achyranthes bidentata BL. An orthogonal array design (OAD), OA(9)(3(4)), was employed as a chemometric method for optimization of the extraction of ecdysterone from the herbal medicine. Four parameters, namely, pressure and temperature of the supercritical fluid, the dynamic extraction time, and the flow rate of dimethyl sulfoxide, were studied and optimized by a three-level OAD. Determinations of the extracts were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of the parameters were studied using analysis of variance. The results shown that the yield of ecdysterone could be influenced by the four parameters to a similar degree. The yield for DMSO-modified supercritical CO(2) was in the range from 0.65 to 1.03 mg/g under the selected conditions. In comparison with methanol-modified supercritical CO(2 )and Soxhlet extraction, a higher yield was obtained when DMSO-modified supercritical CO(2) was used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering and Pharmaceutics, Ningbo Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Ningbo, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yizhe", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ben", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Mingjie", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Sep Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101088554", "ISSNLinking": "1615-9306"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5289-74-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ecdysterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Achyranthes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Analytical"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Ecdysterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18389519", "10.1002/jssc.200700468"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
