Thousands of herbal and traditional compounds are being screened worldwide to validate their use as anti-cancerous drugs. The science of Ayurveda is supposed to add a step on to the curative aspects of cancers that have resemblance with clinical entities of arbuda and granthi mentioned in Sushrutha samhita. Hence, an attempt is made in this review to discuss about the pathology and therapeutic management of various cancers described in Ayurveda. Review of literature on anticancer drugs of plant origin revealed identification of newer ayurvedic drugs that are not mentioned in the ancient texts. These new findings add up to ayurvedic science that has been developed through ages. In addition, details of experimental and clinical studies conducted on single and compound ayurvedic preparations for their anticancer efficacy strongly emphasize ayurvedic therapy as a scientifically driven one and not simply unconventional."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Mississippi, MS 38677, USA. prembala@olemiss.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Balachandran", "ForeName": "Premalatha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Govindarajan", "ForeName": "Rajgopal", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8907422", "ISSNLinking": "1043-6618"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "114"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15519531", "10.1016/j.phrs.2004.04.010", "S1043661804001094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
