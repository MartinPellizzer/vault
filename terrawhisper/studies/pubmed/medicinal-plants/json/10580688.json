With this test DNA of individual cells is stretched by electrophoresis and the migration is measured, which gives an image of the nuclear DNA organisation. Nuclei were sampled when the plants had developed an apical bud, five true leaves and cotyledons. To get an idea of the kind of lesions observed, three different comet protocols were used. The neutral protocol with electrophoresis in a neutral buffer and the semi-alkaline or alkaline assay with alkaline unwinding followed by electrophoresis in neutral alkaline buffer, respectively. For V. faba there was a successive increased cellular DNA mobility with age of the leaves. The percentage DNA migration in control cells of fully developed leaves from N. tabacum almost reached the same level than after irradiation of not fully developed leaves with 50 Gy X-rays. The increased stretching of DNA with leaf age was most obvious if the DNA duplex was converted to single strands by alkali treatment before electrophoresis. Therefore, it could be concluded that with the ageing of leaves there is a decrease in DNA integrity, which could be the result of rising amounts of DNA single-strand breaks and 'alkali-vulnerable sites'."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Toxicology, Flemish Institute of Technological Research (VITO), Mol, Belgium. koppeng@vito.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koppen", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toncelli", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Triest", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verschaeve", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Mech Ageing Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "0347227", "ISSNLinking": "0047-6374"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10580688", "10.1016/s0047-6374(99)00038-x", "S0047-6374(99)00038-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
