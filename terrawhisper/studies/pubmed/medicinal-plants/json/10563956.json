Shear force values declined during processing and storage, but CaCl(2) treatment resulted in greater firmness retention. Processing reduced ascorbic acid content by 63%, and after 124 days, <10% of ascorbic acid remained. Quercetin and luteolin contents declined 45% during processing, but levels stabilized during storage. Capsaicinoid content was stable during processing and storage. CaCl(2) treatment did not affect ascorbic acid, flavonoid, or capsaicinoid retention during pasteurization and storage. Retention of phytochemicals appeared to be related to their solubility and structural properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Horticulture Department, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843-2133, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Howard", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "M4I0D6VV5M", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sterilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10563956", "10.1021/jf980921h", "jf980921h"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
