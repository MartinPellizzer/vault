Chemometric techniques were applied to differentiate samples with respect to their geographical origin and interspecies differentiation. Samples of Cantharellus cibarius (Fr.), Boletus edulis (Bull.) and Leccinum scabrum (Bull.) Gray from Mor\u0105g, August\u00f3w, the Zaborski Landscape Park, Tarnobrzeg and Ume\u00e5 were discriminated by factor 1 and factor 2. Some species, i.e. Cantharellus cibarius, Boletus edulis, Boletus pinophilus (Pil\u00e1t & Dermek), Leccinum aurantiacum (Bull.) Gray, Leccinum scabrum and Leccinum versipelle (Fr. & H\u00f6k) Snell from one region of Poland (August\u00f3w or Mor\u0105g) were discriminated by K, Na, Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn and Cd. The results enabled an assessment of the hypothetical percentage realisation of the recommended dietary intake (RDA) for the bio-elements in question and of provisional tolerable weekly intakes (PTWI) of toxic metals from the consumption of 100\u202fg of mushrooms. The most abundant element in all the mushroom samples was K, especially in Gomphidius glutinosus (Schaeff. ex Fr.) (Ume\u00e5 - Sweden) and Cantharellus cibarius (Poland - Mor\u0105g). Lycoperdon perlatum (Pers.) from Poland and Sweden tended to accumulate the highest levels of Mg, Fe, Zn and Cu. The highest percentage of RDA was obtained for K, Mg and Cu. Based on the estimated PTWI, it can be concluded that no health hazard is associated with the consumption of these mushrooms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
