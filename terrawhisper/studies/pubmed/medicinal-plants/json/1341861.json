All of them belong to the species Phaseolus vulgaris L. In the South American materials the seed size was very similar (mean = 10.4 g/100 seeds). Nevertheless the water absorption was variable 36-64%, the percentages of seed coat and solids were statistically alike, the protein content range varied from 23.8 to 27.2% d.b. In the Mexican wild beans were found the smallest seeds (2.8 g/100 seeds) and those in which the water absorption percentage was very small. These two variables were correlated (r = 0.83**); they have the biggest amount of seed coat and during cooking lose a small quantity of solids. The protein content range was 21.3-24.6%. The lysine quantity was low. The cultivated material had the best physical and technological characteristics, but the average protein content of the group (X = 22.3%) was the lowest, the lysine and tryptophan amounts were 1.14 and 0.36%, respectively. The linear regression coefficient between cooking time and the percentage of cooked seeds was different in the members of each group. After 200 minutes only 85% of the South American accessions were cooked, whereas in the wild Mexican accession 153 only 40% was cooked; accessions 147, 148, 153 and 175 represented a group with long and irregular cooking time; accessions 631, 882, 900 and 939, likewise the cultivated materials Bayomex and Negro Puebla were 100% cooked in 140 minutes. Jamapa needed only 100 minutes in order to be completely cooked."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales y Agropecuarias (INIFAP), Chapingo, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "Vasquez Carrillo", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "C\u00e1rdenas Ramos", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Caracter\u00edsticas f\u00edsicas, tecnol\u00f3gicas y prote\u00ednicas de frijoles (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) silvestres y cultivados."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1341861"]}}]}
