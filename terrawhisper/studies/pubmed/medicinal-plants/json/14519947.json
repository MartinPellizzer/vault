To examine the origin of this effect, we investigated cytokine production in serum and the expression of MHC II in B cells and macrophages in areas of inflammation. Pretreatment with PL 24 h before LPS administration resulted in a significant inhibition of up to 68% of circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, a moderate reduction of 45% of interleukine (IL)-12 and 23% of IL-1beta, but no significant reduction in IL-6. In addition, the expression of MHC II in B cells and macrophages was examined. Our results show that LPS-stimulated cytokine release and the level of MHC II can be modulated by in vivo administration of soluble PL in mice. The decrease of IL-1beta, IL-12 and TNF-alpha in sera and the down-modulation of MHC II during septic shock may contribute to the long survival of mice by PL. Administration of PL in vivo decreases IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in splencotyes and enhances spontaneous cell apoptosis in macrophages and lymphocytes stimulated with LPS in vitro. Thus, part of the anti-inflammatory effects of PL treatment in vivo may result from the enhanced apoptosis of a portion of the activated macrophages and lymphocytes. The ability of PL to significantly reduce the TNF-alpha production indicates the potential of the polysaccharides in possible therapeutic strategies that are based on down-regulation of TNF-alpha."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gi-Young", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roh", "ForeName": "Su-In", "Initials": "SI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Soon-Kew", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Soon-Cheol", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Yang-Hyo", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jae-Dong", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Yeong-Min", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Major Histocompatibility Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Septic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14519947", "10.1248/bpb.26.1418"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
