In August 2022, an investigation of a 10-hectare field of <i>S. baicalensis</i> in Longxi county, Gansu province, China (35\u00b018' N, 104\u00b057' E) found that approximately 90% of the plants were infected with 70% leaves symptomatic. Initially, the thin, radial, irregular white colonies appeared on the adaxial surface of the plant leaves. Subsequently, the white colonies expanded and thickened to cover the entire adaxial surface of the leaves, and gradually spread to the stems and abaxial surface of the leaves. Finally, infected leaves dried out and defoliated prematurely. Tissue from infected plants was collected in order to identify the pathogen. Microscopic observations showed that hyphae were septate, branched, flexuous to straight, 3 to 9 \u00b5m wide. Appressoria were solitary and slightly to distinctly nipple-shaped. Conidiophores were erect, straight or somewhat flexuous, 105 to 145 \u00d7 8 to 13 \u00b5m in size (n=30). The conidia were ellipsoid to ovoid in shape, 25 to 39\u2009\u00d7\u200912 to 21\u2009\u00b5m (n=50), without obvious fibrosin bodies. Chasmothecia were globose or oblate, scattered to gregarious, dark brown, and 85 to 140 \u03bcm in diameter. Appendages were born equatorially on the ascomata, unbranched, 0.5 to 2.5 times as long as the chasmothecial diameter, interlaced with each other, and colorless. Asci were 5 to 12 per chasmothecium (n=30), obovate or suborbicular, 40 to 68\u2009\u00d7\u200920 to 35\u2009\u00b5m (n=30), mostly containing 2-3 ascospores. Ascospores were ellipsoid-ovoid, 14 to 24 \u00d7 10 to 15 \u03bcm (n=30). The fungus was identified as <i>Golovinomyces circumfusus</i> based on these morphological characteristics (Braun and Cook 2012). To validate the identity, the pathogen identification was confirmed through multi-locus phylogeny using internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 28S large ribosomal subunit, intergenic spacer (IGS) and beta-tubulin (TUB2) genes amplified. (Qiu et al. 2020). The resulting sequences were registered in GenBank (OR186707 for ITS, OQ861003 for 28S rDNA, OR193383 for IGS, OR205893 for TUB2). The phylogenetic tree was obtained using maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP 4.0b. The phylogenetic analysis of the multi-locus sequences indicated that the strain HQ1 and <i>G. circumfusus</i> (type) clustered together on the same branch, confirming its identification. Pathogenicity tests were performed on potted 1-year-old plants of <i>S. baicalensis</i> according to Koch's postulates. Three plants were inoculated by gently pressing the naturally infected leaves onto 30 healthy leaves. Three non-inoculated healthy plants served as controls. Inoculated and control plants were placed in separate growth chamber (light/dark, 14 h/10 h; humidity, 70%; temperature, 25\u2103). After 12 days, the inoculated plants developed typical powdery mildew symptoms, but the control leaves remained without symptoms. The fungus on inoculated leaves was re-isolated, sequenced and confirmed as <i>G. circumfusus</i> based on morphological characteristics and molecular identification. Powdery mildew caused by <i>G. circumfusus</i> has been reported affecting <i>Eupatorium cannabinum</i> (Asteraceae) in Germany (Qiu et al. 2020), and <i>Bidens pilosa</i> var. <i>radiata</i> and <i>Passiflora. edulis</i> f. <i>flavicarpa</i> in Taiwan (Lin et al. 2020). There is no previous report about <i>G. circumfusus</i> causing powdery mildew on <i>S. baicalensis</i>. Moreover, although powdery mildew has been reported on <i>S. baicalensis</i> in China, the pathogen was not further identified (Zheng et al. 2010). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by <i>G. circumfusus</i> on <i>S. baicalensis</i> in China and worldwide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; lizy@mail.lzjtu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhaoyu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; lijiajia@mail.lzjtu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiajia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; zzk0721bio@outlook.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zikun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; 695149689@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; tiantian@mail.lzjtu.cn."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Tian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lanzhou Jiaotong University, 12383, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Lanzhou, Gansu, China; shentong@mail.lzjtu.cn."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37486273", "10.1094/PDIS-05-23-0904-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
