Carbazole alkaloids, isolated from the medicinal plants of Murraya species (Rutaceae), have exhibited wide pharmacological activities particularly for neuroinflammation. However, its underlying cellular targets and molecular mechanisms still remain unclear. In current study, we found that murrayafoline A (MA), a carbazole alkaloid obtained from Murraya tetramera, potently inhibited the production of neuroinflammation mediators, such as nitric oxide (NO), TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in LPS-induced BV-2 microglial cells. Then, we performed thermal proteome profiling (TPP) strategy to identify Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) as a potential cellular target of MA. Moreover, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) and drug affinity responsive target stability (DRATS) assays to confirm the direct interaction between MA and Sp1. Furthermore, we downregulated Sp1 expression in BV2 cells using siRNA transfection, and observed that Sp1 knockdown significantly antagonized MA-mediated inhibition of neuroinflammation mediator production. Meanwhile, Sp1 knockdown also markedly reversed MA-mediated inactivation of IKK\u03b2/NF-\u03baB and p38/JNK MAPKs pathways. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that MA significantly suppressed the expression of Iba-1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, while increased the number of Nissl bodies in the brains of LPS-induced mice. Taken together, our study demonstrated that MA exerted obvious anti-neuroinflammation effect by directly targeting Sp1, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. Our findings also provided a promising direction of pharmacological targeting Sp1 for anti-neuroinflammation therapeutics as well as novel agent development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
