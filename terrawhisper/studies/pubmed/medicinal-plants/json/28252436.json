The centuries-old practice of using phyto-preparations (herbal remedies) proved that they have fewer side effects in comparison with synthetic drugs. Despite the wide application of herbal preparations, in the literature there is a little information about their application in development of wound and burn healing modern dosage forms. Among the medicinal plants with the mentioned pharmacological actions, comfrey (Symphytum L.) should be distinguished. Phenolic polymer poly[3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)glyceric acid] (PDGA) or poly[oxy-1-carboxy-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylene], amounting approximately 25% of polysaccharides and 1.5-2.5% of dry plant material, were isolated from the roots and stems of Caucasian comfrey species (S. asperum, S. caucasicum). Contrary to polysaccharides this phenolic polymer of Comfrey appeared to have a high immunomodulatory (anticomplement), antioxidative, antilipoperoxidantive, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing efficacy/activities. The aim of the study was development of the composition and technology of PDGA-containing gel. According to the results of complex biopharmaceutical studies PDGA gel optimal composition has been proved. The technological scheme for preparation of PDGA gel has been developed. PDGA gel stability under normal conditions of storage at +40\u0421 was studied. The gel has a shelf life (determined expiration date) of 2 year."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Gokadze", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Barbakadze", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Mulkijanyan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Bakuridze", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tbilisi State Medical University, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Bakuridze", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Georgia (Republic)", "MedlineTA": "Georgian Med News", "NlmUniqueID": "101218222", "ISSNLinking": "1512-0112"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Excipients"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "poly(3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)glyceric acid)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Comfrey"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Liberation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Excipients"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gels"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glyceric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28252436"]}}]}
