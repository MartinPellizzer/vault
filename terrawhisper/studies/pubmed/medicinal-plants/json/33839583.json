Among tested 15 compounds, 8 derivatives (9a, 9b, 9c, 9d, 9e, 9f, 9h, and 9o) demonstrated superior potency compared to that of positive control, acarbose. Particularly, compound 9d possessed the best anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity with around a 46-fold improvement in the inhibitory activity. Additionally, 9d showed a competitive type of inhibition in the kinetic study and the molecular docking study demonstrated that it well occupied the binding pocket of the catalytic center through desired interactions with residues, correlating to the experimental results."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
