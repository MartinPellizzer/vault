Heat acclimation (HA) improves EC in the heat, but the potential impact of RR on the HA process is unknown. Therefore, our intent was to determine if RR has a positive impact on HA. Twenty male subjects (age, 22.5 \u00b1 3.0 years) completed 2 EC tests involving walking (6 km\u00b7h<sup>-1</sup>) until volitional exhaustion in a climate chamber (air temperature, 42 \u00b0C; relative humidity, 18%) before (H1) and after (H2) an 8-day HA period. One group (SHR; n = 10) ingested standardised extract SHR-5 of RR (a single daily dose of 432 mg), while a second group (PLC; n = 10) administered a placebo prior to each HA session. Efficacy of HA was evaluated on the basis of changes that occurred from H1 to H2 in the time to exhaustion (TTE), exercise heart rate (HR), core and skin temperatures (T<sub>c</sub>, T<sub>sk</sub>), stress hormones, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and fatigue (RPF), and thermal sensation (TS). HA significantly increased TTE (133.1 \u00b1 44.1 min in H1; 233.4 \u00b1 59.8 min in H2; p < 0.0001) and decreased (p < 0.0001) HR, T<sub>c</sub>, T<sub>sk</sub>, stress hormones as well as RPE, RPF, and TS. However, the magnitude of all these changes was similar (p > 0.05) in the SHR and PLC groups. These results suggest that the use of RR during HA has no beneficial performance, physiological, or perceptual effects in young healthy males."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Sport Sciences and Physiotherapy; Estonian Centre of Behavioral and Health Sciences, University of Tartu, 50090 Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "Timpmann", "ForeName": "Saima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Exercise and Sport Science; Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA."}], "LastName": "Hackney", "ForeName": "Anthony C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Psychology; Estonian Centre of Behavioral and Health Sciences, University of Tartu, 50090 Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "Tamm", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Psychology; Estonian Centre of Behavioral and Health Sciences, University of Tartu, 50090 Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "Kreegipuu", "ForeName": "Kairi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Cardiology; Department of Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of Tartu; Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic, Tartu University Hospital, 50406 Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "Unt", "ForeName": "Eve", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Sport Sciences and Physiotherapy; Estonian Centre of Behavioral and Health Sciences, University of Tartu, 50090 Tartu, Estonia."}], "LastName": "\u00d6\u00f6pik", "ForeName": "Vahur", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Appl Physiol Nutr Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "101264333", "ISSNLinking": "1715-5312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Healthy Volunteers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heat-Shock Response"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Processes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Fatigue"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Endurance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28873320", "10.1139/apnm-2017-0372"]}}]}
