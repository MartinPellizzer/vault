The extract was also analyzed for <i>in vitro</i> antioxidative actions by spectrophotometric analysis using 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) method, N, N-dimethyl-1,4-diaminobenzene (DMPD) free radical scavenging method, superoxide radical scavenging method, and nitric oxide scavenging method.", "The experimental results showed a high amount of catechin hydrate (348.62 mg/100 g of dry extract) and moderate amount of gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, and rutin hydrate in the methanol extract of <i>A. argentea</i>. Tannin content was found to be 29.66 mg/g tannic acid equivalent.
