Recently, there is an increasing attention in excavating the medicinal potential of coumestans, particularly coumestrol, wedelolactone, psoralidin and glycyrol, in a variety of diseases. This review is a comprehensive inventory of the chemical structures of coumestans isolated from various plant sources during the period of 1956-2020, together with their reported biological activities. 120 molecules were collected and further classified as coumestans containing core skeleton, dimethylpyranocoumestans, furanocoumestans, O-glycosylated coumestans and others, which showed a wide range of pharmacological activities including estrogenic, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoporotic, organ protective, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, immunosuppressive, antioxidant and skin-protective activities. Furthermore, this review focuses on the counteraction of coumestans against bone diseases and organ damages, and the involved molecular mechanisms, which could provide important information to better understand the medicinal values of these compounds. This review is intended to be instructive for the rational design and development of less toxic and more effective drugs with a coumestan scaffold."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
