Traceability is important for the authentication and quality assessment of Boletaceae mushrooms. In this study, UV-visible and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies were applied for traceability of 247 Boletaceae mushroom samples in combination with chemometrics.", "Compared with a single spectroscopy technique, data fusion strategy can obviously improve the classification performance in partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and grid-search support vector machine (GS-SVM) models, for both species and geographical origin traceability. In addition, PLS-DA and GS-SVM models can provide 100.00% accuracy for species traceability and have reliable evaluation parameters. For geographical origin traceability, the accuracy of prediction in the PLS-DA model by data fusion was just 64.63%, but the GS-SVM model based on data fusion was 100.00%.", "The results demonstrated that the data fusion strategy of UV-visible and FTIR combined with GS-SVM could provide a higher synergic effect for traceability of Boletaceae mushrooms and have a good generalization ability for the comprehensive quality control and evaluation of similar foods. \u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Sen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University, Yuxi, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "HongGao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "JieQing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5376-757X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "YuanZhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Discriminant Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Support Vector Machine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28963727", "10.1002/jsfa.8707"]}}]}
