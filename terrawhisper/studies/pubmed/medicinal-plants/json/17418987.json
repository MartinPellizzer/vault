The data were collected through a series of fieldworks conducted from October to December 2002. Random and systematic sampling methods were employed to select the study sites as well as the informants. Ethnobotanical methods using semi-structured interviews were employed and a total of 83 species of medicinal plants were recorded. The natural environment yielded larger proportion (76 species, 92%) of the total records followed by home gardens of the area. The studied medicinal plants were those used in traditional health care of humans and livestock. However, only very few individuals of each species were found in the area and this might be attributed to the ongoing habitat modification and loss of natural vegetation. Therefore, it is important to create awareness on sustainable use of the natural vegetation. Paying special attention to the medicinal plants found in the area may help to amplify the role that these plants play in healthcare, poverty alleviation as well as environmental protection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Addis Ababa University, P.O.
