Therefore, it is essential to identify a sensitizer that could be used to improve TAM efficacy in treating TAM-resistant breast cancer. Here, we investigated the ability of baicalein to reverse TAM resistance. We found that baicalein increased the efficacy of TAM in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of TAM-resistant cells. It also enhanced the TAM-induced growth reduction of resistant cells from NOD/SCID mouse mammary fat pads, without causing obvious systemic toxicity. Analyses using the CellMiner tool and the Kaplan-Meier plotter database showed that HIF-1\u03b1 expression was inversely correlated with TAM therapeutic response in NCI-60 cancer cells and breast cancer patients. HIF-1\u03b1 expression was increased in TAM-resistant cells due to an increase in mRNA levels and reduced ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Baicalein reduced HIF-1\u03b1 expression by promoting its interaction with PHD2 and pVHL, thus facilitating ubiquitin ligase-mediated proteasomal degradation and thereby suppressing the nuclear translocation, binding to the hypoxia-response element, and transcriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1. As a result, baicalein downregulated aerobic glycolysis by restricting glucose uptake, lactate production, ATP generation, lactate/pyruvate ratio and expression of HIF-1\u03b1-targeted glycolytic genes, thereby enhancing the antiproliferative efficacy of TAM. Furthermore, baicalein interfered with HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition of mitochondrial biosynthesis, which increased mitochondrial DNA content and mitochondrial numbers, restored the generation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria, and thus enhanced the TAM-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The HIF-1\u03b1 stabilizer dimethyloxallyl glycine prevented the baicalein-induced downregulation of glycolysis and mitochondrial biosynthesis and reduced the effects of baicalein on reversing TAM resistance. Our results indicate that baicalein is a promising candidate to help overcome TAM resistance by sensitizing resistant cells to TAM-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. The mechanism underlying the effects of baicalein consists of inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1-mediated aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Authors.
