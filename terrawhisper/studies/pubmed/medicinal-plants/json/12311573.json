The authors of this study have tried gossypol as a vaginal contraceptive. Gossypol acetic acid was dissolved in 0.5 N NaOH, and then diluted. The solution obtained was added to a similar volume of seminal liquid, and sperm motility was carefully measured. The immobilization of spermatozoa was total. The same results were obtained with seminal liquid from rats. One added advantage of vaginal administration of gossypol would be its lubricating quality."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["009762", "00112262"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CONTRACEPTION, FERTILITE, SEXUALITE"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Barrier Methods", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Methods", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12311573", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "09"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["fre"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0301-861X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "7-8", "PubDate": {"Year": "1982", "Season": "Jul-Aug"}}, "Title": "Contraception, fertilite, sexualite", "ISOAbbreviation": "Contracept Fertil Sex (Paris)"}, "ArticleTitle": "[Cottonseed--a source of vaginal contraceptive (author's transl)].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "465", "EndPage": "468", "MedlinePgn": "465-8"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tso", "ForeName": "W W", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "La graine de coton a l'origine d'une contraception vaginale."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Contracept Fertil Sex (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "0411244", "ISSNLinking": "0301-861X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermatocidal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocidal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12311573"]}}]}
