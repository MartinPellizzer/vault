The anticancer efficacy of the ethanolic extract from the pericarps of Garcinia mangostana was investigated in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), melanoma cells (B16F10), breast cancer cells (MCF7), and glioblastoma (U87) cell lines.", "3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure cell viability. Propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis on a flow cytometer were used to identify apoptosis. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured. Moreover, we investigated the synergistic efficacy with several combinations of Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) with doxorubicin.", "GME reduced cell viability in malignant cell dose time-dependently. GME-induced sub- G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells control representing apoptotic cell death is involved in GME toxicity. Furthermore, GME exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration ability of U87 cells, which was accompanied by inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2). Besides, GSH level and SOD activity were significantly reduced while there was an increase in ROS and MDA concentration following 24 hr of GME treatment. Moreover, a combination of GME (1.5-25 \u03bcg/mL) with Dox (6 \u03bcg/mL) displayed synergistic efficacy and cell growth inhibition.", "In conclusion, GME could cause cell death in PC3, MCF7, U87, and B16F10 cell lines, in which apoptosis plays an imperative role. Plant extract decreased the migration ability of the cells by inhibiting the activity and expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). G. mangostana could be a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cancer in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemian", "ForeName": "Shirin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garcinia mangostana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35049434", "10.2174/1570163819666220113100039", "CDDT-EPUB-120145"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
