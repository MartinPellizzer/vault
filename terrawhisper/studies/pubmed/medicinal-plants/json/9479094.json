{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["According to the 1995-96 Paraguayan Reproductive Health Survey of 6465 reproductive-age females, women are more familiar with herbs (yuyos) than any other method of contraception. These herbs are prepared most frequently as teas and drunk every day. 88% of respondents were aware of yuyos. Bivariate analysis indicated that current yuyo users were geographically isolated, older, less educated, poorer, and more likely to speak Guarani in the home than non-users. In the multivariate analysis, ever-use of yuyos was significantly associated with older age (odds ratio (OR), 1.043) and more children (OR, 2.283), while high education (OR, 0.883) and urban residence (0.664) were inversely related to ever-use. Since no protocol exists for yuyo use for contraception, indigenous women rely on word-of-mouth advice and may be at risk of toxic side effects from improper use. Needed, to reduce this risk, are research studies on the use of herbs in other countries for contraceptive purposes and more rigorous testing of the chemical agents found in plants used for fertility control. If efficacy is discovered, additional research is recommended to identify the conditions under which and for how long yuyos should be taken for contraception or menstrual regulation. Any program that builds on yuyo use to promote use of modern contraceptive methods must proceed in a culturally sensitive way."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["131144", "00272905"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acceptor Characteristics", "Acceptors", "Americas", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Usage--determinants", "Culture", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Family Planning Programs", "Family Planning Surveys", "Health", "Health Services", "Latin America", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Paraguay", "Plants, Medicinal--therapeutic use", "Research Report", "South America"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "9479094", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "02", "Day": "26"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0739-9332", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "19", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998", "Season": "Jan-Feb"}}, "Title": "Health care for women international", "ISOAbbreviation": "Health Care Women Int"}, "ArticleTitle": "Contraception and culture: the use of yuyos in Paraguay.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "49", "EndPage": "60", "MedlinePgn": "49-60"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The use of herbs (yuyos) as contraception is common practice in Paraguay. This report analyzes data from the 1995-1996 Paraguayan Reproductive Health Survey. The analysis reveals that women are more familiar with yuyos (88%) than any other method of family planning. Modeling the determinants of ever having relied on yuyos as contraception demonstrates that older women (OR = 1.043) and women with more children (OR = 2.283) are significantly more likely to have used yuyos, but an interaction between older women with more children shows they are less likely to have used this method (OR = .982). Women living in rural areas (OR = .664) and those with more education (OR = .883) are less likely to have used the method. These findings show widespread acceptance and use of yuyos for contraception in Paraguay. More research into the chemical properties of yuyos is needed to determine their contraceptive efficacy and to prevent harmful effects from their misuse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Denver Public Health, Colorado 80204, USA."}], "LastName": "Bull", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mel\u00edan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Health Care Women Int", "NlmUniqueID": "8411543", "ISSNLinking": "0739-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Paraguay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9479094", "10.1080/073993398246575"]}}]}
