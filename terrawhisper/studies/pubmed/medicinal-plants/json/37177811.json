The objective of the current research was to investigate the interaction of major phytoconstituents of <i>Acorus calamus</i> with bacterial (6VJE) and fungal (1EA1) protein targets. Protein-ligand interactions were estimated using the AutoDock software, drug likeness was predicted by using the molinspiration server and toxicity was predicted with the swissADME and protox II servers. MD simulation of phytocompounds with the best profiles was done on the GROMACS software for 100\u2009ns. Molecular docking results showed among all the selected major phytoconstituents, that \u03b2-cadinene showed best binding interaction in complex with bacterial (6VJE) and fungal (1EA1) protein targets with binding energy -7.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.1 and -7.73\u2009\u00b1\u20090.15\u2009kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Drug likeness and toxicity predictions showed that \u03b2-cadinene follows all rules of drug likeness and toxicity. MD simulation study revealed that \u03b2-cadinene fit in binding pocket of bacterial and fungal targets and found to be stable throughout the duration of the simulation. Based on the observations from this in-silico study it is being proposed that \u03b2-cadinene, a major phytocompound of <i>Acorus calamus,</i> can be considered for the treatment of bacterial and fungal infections since the study shows that it might be one of the compounds that contributes majorly to the plant's biological activity. This study needs <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> validation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
