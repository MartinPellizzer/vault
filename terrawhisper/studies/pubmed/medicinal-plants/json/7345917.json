Results obtained from the concentration and time course study in bulb and seeding root tip cells indicate that Rg1 promotes and Rb1 inhibits mitosis, both being dose-dependent. The promoting effect of Rg1 on the rate of DNA synthesis was observed at the peak hour which occurs at the same time as that of the control. Rb1 was found to shift the peak hour of DNA synthesis to a later period of the experiment. These results are in agreement with the results obtained from the study of the cell cycle by pulse labeling and autoradiography, which show that Rg1 shortens the mitotic cell cycle and S period while Rb1 lengthens them. They in turn increase and decrease the mitotic indices respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ng", "ForeName": "W Y", "Initials": "WY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Interphase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7345917", "10.1142/s0192415x81000160", "S0192415X81000160"]}}]}
