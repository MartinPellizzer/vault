Scopolamine has a larger demand than hyoscyamine due to its stronger pharmacological effects and fewer side reactions. It is extracted from solanaceous plants. However, the content of scopolamine is lower than hyoscyamine in D. innoxia. Hyoscyamine 6\u03b2-hydroxylase (H6H, EC1.14.11.11) is the key enzyme which can catalyze hyoscyamine to form scopolamine. In this study, a cDNA encoding H6H was cloned from D. innoxia roots and named Dih6h. The full-length cDNA is 1413 bp in length with a 1044-bp open reading frame encoding 347 amino acids. The deduced protein sequence of D. innoxia H6H (DiH6H) shared high identity with H6Hs from other plants. The DiH6H was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via His-tag affinity technique. The recombinant DiH6H showed activity in transforming hyoscyamine to scopolamine. Despite Dih6h mRNA was detected in various tissues, its levels in roots were higher than that in other tissues. Indeed, scopolamine accumulation was low in roots, but it was very high in aerial parts, especially in flowers and seeds. These observations suggest that scopolamine may be synthesized in the roots and subsequently transported to the aerial parts. To further verify in vivo function of DiH6H, the cDNA of DiH6H was overexpressed in D. innoxia hairy roots. As expected, an increase of scopolamine production was observed in the positive transformants. The results provide a potential strategy for increasing scopolamine yield by metabolic engineering of its biosynthetic pathway in D. innoxia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
