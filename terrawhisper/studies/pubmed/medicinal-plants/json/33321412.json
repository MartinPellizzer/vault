Among the constituents of B. natalensis, knipholone was the most potent PXR activator (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5M) followed by bulbine-knipholone (EC<sub>50</sub> 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5M), and 6'-methylknipholone (EC<sub>50</sub> 4.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5M). Knipholone was also the most effective in increasing the expression of CYP3A4 (8.47 \u00b1 2.5 fold) and CYP2C9 (2.64 \u00b1 0.3 fold) at 10 \u00b5M. Docking studies further confirmed the unique structural features associated with knipholones for their superior inductive potentials in the activation of PXR compared to other anthraquinones. In a CYP inhibition assay, the methanolic extract as well as the anthraquinones strongly inhibited the catalytic activity of CYP2C9 while, inhibition of CYP3A4 was weak.", "These results suggest that consumption of B. natalensis may pose a potential risk for HDI if taken with conventional medications that are substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and may contribute to unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish their clinical relevancy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
