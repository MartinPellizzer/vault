Consumer consumption of DSs is growing annually. The U.S. FDA regulates conventional and botanical drugs for safety and efficacy; however, DSs are minimally regulated.", "This article will: i) highlight the importance of NP as a significant source of prescription drugs; ii) discuss differences in the regulation of conventional drugs of NP product, botanical drugs, and DSs; iii) discuss the safety and efficacy of DSs and iv) make recommendations for improvement of safety for minimally regulated NPs.", "Toxicities associated with the use of NPs, including vitamins and DSs, are mainly due to excessive use and interactions with conventional drug(s) and may represent challenges for clinicians. Conventional and botanical-based prescription drugs are rarely associated with unknown toxicities. However, DSs are minimally regulated and can produce severe adverse effects. We believe that clinical pharmacologists can have a role in developing criteria for DS safety analysis. There is also the potential for a standardized NP stewardship program(s) and the development of NP policies and practices nationally and globally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah School of Medicine , Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}], "LastName": "Enioutina", "ForeName": "Elena Y", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah School of Medicine , Salt Lake City, UT, USA."}], "LastName": "Job", "ForeName": "Kathleen M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Department, Center of Medicine, All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR) , Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Krepkova", "ForeName": "Lubov V", "Initials": "LV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University , Cleveland, OH, USA."}], "LastName": "Reed", "ForeName": "Michael D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0844-3207"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatrics, Wright State University Boonshoft School of Medicine/Dayton Children's Hospital , Dayton, OH, USA."}], "LastName": "Sherwin", "ForeName": "Catherine M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101278296", "ISSNLinking": "1751-2433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology, Clinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Professional Role"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States Food and Drug Administration"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32730191", "10.1080/17512433.2020.1803739"]}}]}
