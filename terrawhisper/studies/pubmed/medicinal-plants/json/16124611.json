Began to give the rats drugs in the fifth week after the operation. After 12 weeks killed the rats. The blood,the uterus and bones were collected to inspect. The content of estrogen (E2) in serum was detected by radioimmunoassay method. The contents of Ca, P, ALP in serum were detected using the automic biochemistry-analyse device. The uterus were weight and the length, width, dry weight and net weight of the shoulder bone were measured. The contents of Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn in the bone were measured using the automic absorption spectrophotometer. The right femer and the third lumbar vertebra were detected for BMD using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanner and compression test using electronic testing device.", "After using the drugs,the content of E2, Ca in serum, the weight of uterus, the contents of Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn in the bone and the BMD of right femer increased significantly, the content of P, ALP in serum decreased significantly.", "Yifuning soft capsules has a good effect on postmenopausal osteoporosis, which provides evidence for clinical use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Nanfang Medicine University, Guangzhou 510515, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Hong-Zhu", "Initials": "HZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bone and Bones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rana temporaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16124611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
