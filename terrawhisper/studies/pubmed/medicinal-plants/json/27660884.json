The effects of using aloe vera gel on the healing process were investigated by microscopic methods, cell counting, and TGF-\u03b2 gene expression in the wound bed. Sixty Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were placed under anesthesia in sterile conditions. A square 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm wound was made on the back of the neck. The rats were divided into control and 2 experimental groups. Additionally, the control and experimental groups were separated into 3 subgroups corresponding to 4, 7, and 14 days of study. In the first experimental group, aloe vera was used twice on the wound. The second experimental group received aloe vera overtreatment once on the wound. The positive control group received daily application of 1% phenytoein cream following surgical wound creation. The control group did not receive any treatment. This tissue was examined using histological staining (H&E) and Masson's Trichrome. Wound surface and wound healing were evaluated separately. TGF-\u03b2 gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. Results showed that fibroblasts in both experimental groups were significantly increased, thereby acceleration wound healing. Application of aloe vera gel will increase TGF-\u03b2 gene expression, ultimately accelerating the wound healing process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Takzaree", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadjiakhondi", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hassanzadeh", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran."}], "LastName": "Rouini", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Medicinal Plants Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Manayi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Yale School of Medicine, CT 06510, USA."}], "LastName": "Zolbin", "ForeName": "Masoumeh Majidi", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aloe vera gel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27660884", "10.1139/cjpp-2015-0460"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
