DC 3000 extensively regulates its virulence traits through quorum sensing mechanism involving expression of psyI, an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase gene and psyR, a luxR-type regulator. In this study, exposure of DC 3000 to 80\u00a0ppm linalool concentration resulted in reduced biofilm formation, hampered motility, decreased AHL production, and reduced secretion of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes followed by negligible effect on the bacterial count and its metabolic activity. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which play a crucial role in the development of biofilm and subsequent infection was significantly reduced which was further confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The qRT PCR analysis of the gene expression analysis of virulence genes (syringafactin production gene syfA, type III secretion system gene hrpA, flagellar genes fleQ and fliC, and coronatine production gene cfl unveiled significant downregulation of the same under Lin 80\u00a0ppm concentration. To further confirm the aforementioned possibilities, docking simulations run between PsyR and linalool suggested a strong interaction with the developed protein model. Overall, the treatment of DC 3000 with Lin 80\u00a0ppm affected the phenotypic and genotypic expressions associated with quorum sensing, thereby significantly reducing the infection rate as observed in in-vivo plant assay."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
