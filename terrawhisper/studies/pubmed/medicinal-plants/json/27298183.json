The cortex is divided into two odorless crude drugs Guanhuangbo and Huangbo. Historically, it has been difficult to distinguish their identities due to a lack of identification methods. This study was executed to confirm the identity and to ensure the species traceability of Phellodendri Cortex. In the current study, analysis is based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and psbA-trnH intergenic spacer (psbA-trnH) barcodes and HPLC fingerprint was carried out to guarantee the species traceability of Guanhuangbo and Huangbo. DNA barcoding data successfully identified the three plants of the Phellodendron genus species by ITS+psbA-trnH, with the ability to distinguish the species origin of Huangbo. Moreover, the psbA-trnH data distinguished Guanhuangbo and Huangbo except to trace species. The HPLC fingerprint data showed that Guanhuangbo was clearly different from Huangbo, but there was no difference between the two origins of Huangbo. Additionally, the result of hierarchical clustering analysis, based on chlorogenic acid, phellodendrine, magnoflorine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine and berberine, was consistent with the HPLC fingerprint analysis. These results show that DNA barcoding and HPLC fingerprint can discriminate Guanhuangbo and Huangbo. However, DNA barcoding is more powerful than HPLC fingerprint for species traceability in the identification of related species that are genetically similar. DNA barcoding is a useful scientific tool to accurately confirm the identities of medicinal materials from multiple sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education/Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhipeng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhao", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Haitao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ben'gang", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Yonghong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Intergenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Intergenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phellodendron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27298183", "10.1248/bpb.b16-00210"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
