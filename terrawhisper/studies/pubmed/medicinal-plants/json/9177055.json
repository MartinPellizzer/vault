The enzyme was separated from 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase by fractionated ammonium sulphate precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The CoA ligases exhibited different substrate specificities. 3-Hydroxybenzoate:coenzyme A ligase activated 3-hydroxybenzoic acid most efficiently and lacked affinity for cinnamic acids. In contrast, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase mainly catalyzed the activation of 4-coumaric acid but did not act on benzoic acids. The two enzymes were similar with respect to their relative molecular weight, their pH and temperature optima, their specific activity and the changes in their activity during cell culture growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie, Bonn, Germany."}], "LastName": "Barillas", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beerhues", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "4-hydroxybenzoate coenzyme A ligase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Coenzyme A Ligases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.2.1.12", "NameOfSubstance": "4-coumarate-CoA ligase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coenzyme A Ligases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9177055", "10.1007/s004250050109", "10.1007/s004250050109"]}}]}
