Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, ALP, AST, and ALT were measured with specific commercial kits and glucose with a strip glucometer. The thiobarbituric acid method measured the liver MDA level, while a colorimetric assay measured the GSH level and PTP1B activity. A UPLC-DAD profile was obtained to identify the main polyphenolic compound in the EAF.", "Treatment with CEE and EAF reduced plasma glucose in diabetic mice. At the end of the treatment, the plasma glucose level was significantly lower in EAF-treated (100\u00a0mg/kg) diabetic mice (106.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7\u00a0mg/dL) than those treated with 100\u00a0mg/kg CEE (175.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.9\u00a0mg/dL), both significantly lower than untreated diabetic mice (350.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.1\u00a0mg/dL). The serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, ALP, AST, and ALT were significantly reduced in diabetic mice treated with CEE and EAF. In the livers of diabetic mice, the treatment with CEE and EAF reduced MDA levels and the activity of the enzyme PTP1B (96.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7%, 113.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%, and 134.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6% for CEE-, EAF-treated, and untreated diabetic mice, respectively). Galloylpunicalagin was the main polyphenol observed in the EAF of T. phaeocarpa.", "The present results demonstrate the significant antidiabetic effect of CEE and EAF of T. phaeocarpa and their reduction on the markers of liver dysfunction in diabetic mice. Moreover, the antidiabetic activity of T. phaeocarpa might be associated with lowering the augmented activity of the PTP1B enzyme in the liver of diabetic mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
