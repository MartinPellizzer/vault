This paper analyzed chemical components of Alpinia katsumadai of zingiberaceae and applied several laminar analysis to further develop its active ingredients, aiming to make sure its function on tumor assistance. Actually, cardamomin contained in Alpinia katsumadai has been recorded to act notably in myeloma resistance, which was verified by cholecystokinin-octopeptide (CCK-8) in this paper. Cardamom in is proved to have multiple anti-myeloma effects, including myeloma cell activity and proliferation control, cell cycle retardant and apoptosis induction, which indicates its value in the field of medical pharmacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jue", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Rubiao", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Lianjing", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of orthopedics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H8KP1OJ8JX", "NameOfSubstance": "cardamonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alpinia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Elettaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Myeloma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26051719"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
