Levels of aflatoxin intake were evaluated in dietary samples from households across the country, and crop samples taken from representative farms. Prevalence of hepatitis B markers was estimated from the serum of blood donors, and liver cancer incidence was recorded for the years 1979-83 through a national system of cancer registration. Across 4 broad geographic regions, there was a more than 5-fold variation in the estimated daily intake of aflatoxin, ranging from 3.1 to 17.5 micrograms. The proportion of HBV-exposed individuals was very high (86% in men), but varied relatively little by geographic region; the prevalence of carriers of the surface antigen was 23% in men, and varied from 21 to 28%. Liver cancer incidence varied over a 5-fold range, and was strongly associated with estimated levels of aflatoxin. In an analysis involving 10 smaller subregions, aflatoxin exposure emerged as a more important determinant of the variation in liver cancer incidence than the prevalence of hepatitis infection. Aflatoxin estimates from crop samples appeared to be a reasonable surrogate for dietary measurements. A comparison with dietary aflatoxin levels measured in an earlier survey in Swaziland suggested that programmes aimed at reducing contamination levels had had some success."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peers", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bosch", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaldor", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Linsell", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pluijmen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hepatitis B Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Donors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier State"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eswatini"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Registries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3570547", "10.1002/ijc.2910390502"]}}]}
