The prominent signs of Cassia poisoning were diarrhea, inappetence, dyspnea, staggering, ataxia and recumbency. Lesions consisted of hemorrhages and congestion in the heart, lungs, abomasum and spleen, catarrhal enteritis, hepatic fatty change and necrosis, splenic hemosiderosis, pulmonary emphysema, necrosis and/or degeneration of the epithelial cells of the renal convoluted tubule, and packing of the glomeruli with endothelial and small round cells. These changes were accompanied by increases in GOT activity and in the serum concentrations of ammonia and urea, as well as by decreases in the total protein and calcium in serum. There were decreases in Hb, PCV and RCB, and increased leucocyte counts. Total lipids were higher in the liver, kidneys and heart of the Cassia-poisoned goats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suliman", "ForeName": "H B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wasfi", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adam", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Chemical Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7135798"]}}]}
