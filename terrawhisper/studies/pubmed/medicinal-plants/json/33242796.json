Deficiency or excess of Se can cause harm to human health. A previous study showed an association of Se with cardiovascular and diabetes diseases. One of the food sources of Se is vegetables. In West Java, Indonesia, people consume fresh vegetables such as Garlic, Jengkol, and Petai. This research aims to study the correlation between the gastronomy culture of people in West Java, Se content in Garlic (Allium sativum), Jengkol (Archidendron pauciflorum) and Petai (Parkia speciosa) from several Regencys/cities in West Java, and the prevalence cardiovascular and diabetic diseases.", "A cultural study was conducted based on a literature review. Cluster sampling was chosen for the sampling method. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in these regencies were obtained from the Ministry of Health of Indonesia. The measurement of Se content in a sample was conducted by the fluorometry method, based on the formation of the piazoselenol complex from the reaction between selenite ion and DAN (2,3-diaminonapthalene).", "People in West Java prefer to consume garlic, jengkol, and petai as a fresh vegetable as part of their culture. The highest content of Se in Allium sativum was found in Tasikmalaya City with a value of 69.20\u2009ng/g. For Archidendron pauciflorum from Subang Regency values were 498\u2009ng/g. Parkia speciosa found in the Bandung Barat Regency had a mean value 257.9\u2009ng/g. There is a positive correlation between Se-concentration in Archidendron pauciflorum and the prevalence of diabetes while negative correlation with the prevalence of cardiovascular disease. In addition, no correlation was observed for Allium sativum and Parkia Specose might be due to a lower Se-concentration in these vegetables that in the Archidendron fauciflorum.", "Different areas have varying concentrations of Se in plants that grow in the region. The gastronomy culture and Se content may play a role to increase or decrease cardiovascular and diabetes prevalence in that area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
