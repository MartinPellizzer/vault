J. V contained more volatile oil than European Valerianae. Therefore, J.V was exported mainly to Germany until the War II and was highly evaluated by foreign countries. After the War II, the food situation in Japan was bad. Then the increase of foodstuff production had priority over the herb growth. Therfore, J.V was not widely cultured all over Japan as before the War II. After the War II, J.V was cultured only in Hokkaido. Valerianae Radix cultured in Hokkaido was changed to Hokkai-Kisso from J. V after the War II. The beginning of Hokkai-Kisso could not be confirmed completely yet by this study. The operation of Valerianae is easy and safe. So it is thought that Valerianae Radix may be used for raw materials of general drugs and will remain in the general drug market mainly in the future too."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Japanese Society of History of Pharmacy."}], "LastName": "Yanagisawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11613504"]}}]}
