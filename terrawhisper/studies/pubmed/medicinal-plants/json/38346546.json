The structures were determined by interpreting NMR, HRESIMS and ECD data. The X-ray crystal structure of 4, 7 and 8 were reported for the first time. In the anti-vitiligo activity test, compounds 2, 7, 12, 23 and 24 demonstrated activity in promoting melanogenesis at a concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcM in B16\u00a0cells, with 8-methoxypsoralan (8-MOP) as a positive control. Further research on the mechanism revealed that artemongolides H (2) enhance the expression of MITF and TRPs by upregulating p-Akt and p-GSK-3\u03b2, leading to an increase in \u03b2-catenin content in the cell cytoplasm. Subsequently, \u03b2-catenin translocates into the nucleus, resulting in melanogenesis. The results supported the regulation of melanogenesis by artemongolide H (2) through the Akt/GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. The anti-inflammatory results demonstrated that compounds 4, 5, 6, 9 and 14 can inhibit the upregulation of IL-6 mRNA and CCL2 mRNA expression. Compound 12 specifically inhibited the upregulation of IL-6 mRNA expression. These compounds exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activities. The activity results revealed that these sesquiterpene compounds have the potential to become lead compounds for the treatment of vitiligo and inflammatory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
