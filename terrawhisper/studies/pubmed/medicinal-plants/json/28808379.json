Bergapten and methoxsalen were separated and purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography. Quantification of the furanocoumarins has been conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography, and all the plant extracts and pure compounds were checked for antibacterial activities utilizing alamar blue microplate assay.", "<i>Cuminum cyminum</i> was deprived of bergapten and methoxsalen and methoxsalen was not detected from <i>Apium graveolens</i>. Bergapten was abundant in PE more than in EtOH; on the other hand, EtOH was rich in methoxsalen. The separation of the two structural isomers was performed using normal phase chromatography and ultraviolet light as an indicator. All extracts showed weak to moderate antibacterial activities against Gram-positive isolates which were more sensitive than the negative ones. <i>C. cyminum</i> extract was least active, uncover the antibacterial role of bergapten and methoxsalen.", "These findings support the medicinal use of seeds of seven plants from <i>Apiaceae</i> family and quantify the two pharmacologically important furanocoumarins (bergapten and methoxsalen).", "This study was conducted to evaluate the antibacterial activities of seven plants seeds used in local medicine in Iraq. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify bergapten and xanthotoxin in non-polar and polar extracts of these seeds.
