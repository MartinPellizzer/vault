Kaempferol is a flavonol, type of flavonoid found in eatable plants and in plants usually employed in ancient drugs (<i>Moringa oleifera</i>, Tilia spp., fern genus spp. and gingko etc.). Some medicinal studies have shown that the use of foods full of kaempferol decreases the risk of many (cancer, vascular) diseases. All the data of 50 kaempferol derivatives were collected from PubChem database. Through Schr\u00f6dinger software, 3D-QSAR study was performed for 50 compounds by using method of field base. Conformer of kaempferol derivatives was docked against anti-diabetic, anti-microbial co-crystal structures and protein. To monitor the best anti-diabetic and antibacterial agent, particular kaempferol derivatives were downloaded from PubChem database. Virtual screening by molecular docking provided four lead compounds with four different proteins. These hit compounds were found to be potent inhibitor for diabetic enzymes alpha-amylase and DPP IV and had the potential to suppress DNA gyrase and dihydrofolate reductase synthesis. Molecular dynamic simulation of docked complexes evaluates the value of root mean square fluctuation by iMOD server. Kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-(2, 3-di-Z-p-coumaroyl) rhamnoside <b>(42)</b> compound used as anti-diabetic and kaempferol 3-O-gentiobioside <b>(3)</b> as antibacterial with good results can be used for drug discovery.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
