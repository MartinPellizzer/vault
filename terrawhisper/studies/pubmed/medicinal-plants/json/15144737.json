Br. (Asclepiadaceae) a wildly growing plant has been reported to possess number of medicinal properties and other purposes. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate scientifically the anti-diarrheal effects of C. gigantea used traditionally in Indian system of medicine using castor oil-induced diarrhoea model.", "The anti-diarrheal effect of hydroalcoholic (50:50) extract of aerial part of Calotropis gigantea was studied against castor oil-induced-diarrhea model in rats. The gastrointestinal transit rate was expressed as the percentage of the longest distance traversed by the charcoal divided by the total length of the small intestine. The weight and volume of intestinal content induced by castor oil were studied by enteropooling method.", "Like atropine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) there were significant reductions in fecal out put and frequency of droppings when the plant extracts of 200 and 400 mg/kg doses were administered intraperitoneally compared with castor oil treated rats. All doses of the plant extracts also significantly retarded the castor-oil induced enteropooling and intestinal transit. The dose 100 (P<0.01), 200 and 400 mg/kg significantly inhibited (P<0.001) weight and volume of intestinal content.", "The remarkable anti-diarrheal effect of C.gigantea extract against castor oil-induced diarrhea model attests to its utility in a wide range of diarrheal states"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy, Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India. hrchitme@rediffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chitme", "ForeName": "Havagiray R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chandra", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaushik", "ForeName": "Sadhna", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9807281", "ISSNLinking": "1482-1826"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-79-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Castor Oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Castor Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Transit"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15144737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
