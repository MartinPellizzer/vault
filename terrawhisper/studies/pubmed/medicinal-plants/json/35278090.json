Five millilitres of venous blood samples were collected aseptically from each individual. Sera and buffy coats were isolated from each sample and evaluated for anti-Toxoplasma antibodies and T. gondii DNA using ELISA kit and real-time PCR, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18 software.", "Of 64 AIDS/HIV-positive patients, six (9.3%, 95% CI 7.2 to 11.3%) were seropositive for only IgG and five (7.8%, 95% CI 6.0 to 9.5%) were seropositive for both IgG and IgM. Moreover, among 64 healthy controls, 10 (15.6%, 95% CI 12.1 to 19.0%) were seropositive for only IgG and 2 (3.1%, 95% CI 2.4 to 3.7%) were seropositive for both IgG and IgM. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected in six samples (9.3%, 95% CI 7.2 to 11.3%) in the AIDS/HIV-positive patients group and eight samples (5.95%, 95% CI 4.6 to 7.2%) in the control group using real-time PCR. Consumption of undercooked meat was documented as an associated risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity in AIDS patients (OR 4.06, 95% CI 0.966 to 17.09; p=0.045).", "Our findings showed a lower prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in AIDS/HIV-positive patients vs healthy controls; however, a considerable number of AIDS/HIV-positive patients were also seen to be at risk of toxoplasmosis. Based on the findings, screening and prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis should be implemented for all AIDS/HIV-positive patients in Southwest Iran."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
