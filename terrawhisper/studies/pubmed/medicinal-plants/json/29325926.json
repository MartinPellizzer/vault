Most urinary calculi have as a major component calcium oxalate which occurs mainly in two crystalline forms: Calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) and calcium oxalate dihydrate (weddellite). The target behind, this work is to study the inhibiting effect of the calcium oxalate's crystallization by the extract of the Ammi visnaga and the Punica granatum.", "The inhibition of crystallization has been studied in vitro with both the absence and the presence of the different concentrations of the extracts of the two plants. This study consists in measurement, with the UV-Visible spectrophotometer, the temporal evolution of the optical density at \u03bb equal to 620nm corresponding to the formation of the crystals due to the mixing of metastable solutions of calcium and oxalate. The characterization of the crystals is carried out in parallel by both the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and the observation of the crystals with the help of an optical microscope. In this respect, the inhibition percentages were calculated from the turbidity slopes in the presence and absence of the extract.", "The results obtained were more effective, especially for Punica granatum with percentages of 97.8\u00b10.12 and 83.46\u00b11.34% against nucleation and aggregation, respectively, the order of Ammi visnaga was as follow: 73.25\u00b10.81 and 59.44\u00b13.3%. Thus, all correlation coefficients are greater than 0.95 and all coefficients of variation are less than 10%.", "The prevention and treatment of urinary lithiasis and especially in the case of recurrence by plants remains an alternative choice for medical methods. This study justified the efficacy of the plants Ammi visnaga and in particular Punica granatum against the crystallization of calcium oxalate.", "3."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
