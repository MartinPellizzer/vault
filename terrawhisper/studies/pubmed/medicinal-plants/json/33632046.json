Trehalose possesses various biological effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, there is little data on the effects of trehalose on human cells including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we aimed to investigate whether trehalose could attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in PBMCs.", "The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and RT-PCR were used to assess the levels of inflammatory cytokines. To investigate the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-\u03baB, western blot analysis was utilized. Oxidant-antioxidant markers were assessed using ELISA and colorimetric procedures.", "The results revealed that trehalose significantly mitigated the effect of LPS on the phosphorylation of JNK and NF-\u03baB-P65 (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.00). This mitigation was associated with significantly reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 and increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (<i>P</i> <\u00a0.05). The antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) also showed similar effects on JNK and NF-\u03baB-P65 phosphorylation and inflammatory cytokines (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.00). Furthermore, trehalose alleviated oxidative stress in LPS-stimulated PBMCs as it reversed the altered levels of malondialdehyde and total thiols (<i>p</i> \u2264\u00a0.05) and restored the activity of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and manganese superoxide dismutase (<i>p</i> <\u00a0.001).", "The results of this study indicated that trehalose prevented inflammation and oxidative stress in the LPS-stimulated PBMCs, providing evidence for the benefits of trehalose as a potential therapeutic agent in inflammatory conditions.", "LPS: Lipopolysaccharide;
