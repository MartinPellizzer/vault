Apocynin, a natural polyphenolic compound, is a component of many plants. It has many medicinal and pharmacological properties. Pyrogallol is an anti-psoriatic agent. However, its clinical usage is limited due to its cumulative and dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. The objective of this study was to synthesize silver nanoparticles coated with Apocynin (Apo-AgNPs), and investigate the antioxidant and liver protective effects of Apo-AgNPs on pyrogallol-induced toxicity in rats. The nanoparticles were characterized and it was determined that the synthesis technique results in homogeneously dispersed core-shell Ag structures with spherical forms and an average diameter of 13\u00a0nm (6.3\u00a0nm). Our results showed that Apo-AgNPs exhibited potent antioxidant and excellent membrane stability activities in vitro. In rats, Apo-AgNPs (10 and 30\u00a0mg/kg) significantly prevented pyrogallol-induced elevations of alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, creatinine, urea, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and decreased blood levels of uric acid. Moreover, Apo-AgNPs restored the decreased activities of the liver antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, as well as non-enzyme antioxidant glutathione, as well as significantly decreased catalase activities which were induced by pyrogallol treatment. Histological studies indicated that pyrogallol -induced liver damage was alleviated following Apo-AgNPs treatment in rats. Apo-AgNPs significantly suppressed the up-regulation of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) protein expression. These results indicated that Apo-AgNPs protected the rats from damage via preserving the antioxidant defense systems, lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines, and expression of COX-2 and NF-\u03baB in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
