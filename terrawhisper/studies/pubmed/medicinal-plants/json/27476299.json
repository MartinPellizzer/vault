The study instrument consisted of multiple-choice items related to personal knowledge about and experience with the use of P. ginseng and its analogues. In total, 1233 customers participated in the study. Of study participants, 18.1% reported the use of P. ginseng and its analogues in their lives. P. ginseng preparations were used mostly according to the well- known indications (tiredness, weakness and decreased mental and physical capacity). Of P. ginseng users 44.3% reported positive treatment effects and 12.0% had experienced different side effects. With increase of age (p < 0.01) and at lower levels of education (p = 0.04), the use of ginseng or its analogues decreased. The better the users evaluated their health, the better they perceived the effect of P. ginseng preparations (p < 0.01). This study reported rather frequent use of P. ginseng and its analogues. P. ginseng could be seen in the treatment of conditions, where the use of local medicinal plants has not been established. Further research is needed to learn more about public knowledge and experiences about efficacy and safety of P. ginseng and its analogues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Volmer", "ForeName": "Dasy", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raal", "ForeName": "Ain", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kalle", "ForeName": "Raivo", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "S\u00f5ukand", "ForeName": "Renata", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Utilization"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Estonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27476299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
