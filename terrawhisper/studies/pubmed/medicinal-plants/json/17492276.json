In the present work, a geminal dicationic IL, 1,9-di(3-vinylimidazolium)nonane bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imidate, was investigated for this purpose. To find the best way to achieve satisfactory separations simultaneously for the compounds in essential oils, the dicationic IL was used as the stationary phase for capillary gas chromatography (GC) in two ways, either in its pure state or as a mixed stationary phase with monocationic ILs and a polysiloxane diluent. Interestingly, it was found that the mixed stationary phase exhibited a much better selectivity for polar and nonpolar compounds than either the dicationic IL or the polysiloxane, suggesting that a kind of synergistic effect occurred when these stationary phases were combined in the way described. A comparison with two commercial stationary phases (polar and nonpolar) indicated that this novel mixed stationary phase behaved in a way closer to a polar stationary phase in terms of selectivity and elution order. The present work demonstrates that the mixed stationary phase is efficient and selective and can be an alternative choice for the GC analysis of samples of complex composition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, School of Science, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. mlqi@bit.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Meiling", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Armstrong", "ForeName": "Daniel W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1,9-di(3-vinylimidazolium)nonane bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)imidate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidoesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Siloxanes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cations"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Imidoesters"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ionic Liquids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Siloxanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17492276", "10.1007/s00216-007-1290-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
