In the present study, we examined the effects of Eryngium billardieri extract, as an anti-diabetic herbal medication, on the heart mRNA level of Akt serine/threonine kinase (Akt), mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), and Forkhead box o1 (Foxo1) in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance (IR). We also assessed the anti-diabetic effects of E.\u00a0billardieri extract in rats with insulin resistance.", "Twenty-seven male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Nine rats were fed a normal diet (control group), and 18 rats were fed an HFD for 13 weeks (HFD group). To confirm the induction of insulin resistance, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. Then rats with IR were randomly divided into the following groups: the HFD group, which continued an HFD, and the group treated with E.\u00a0billardieri extract, which received the extract at a concentration of 50\u00a0mg/kg for 30 days. On the 30th day, the animals were sacrificed and serum samples were collected for biochemistry analyses. Furthermore, the expression of Akt, mTOR, PPAR\u03b3, and Foxo1 was measured in heart tissue using the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.", "Real-time PCR analyses revealed that an HFD can significantly decrease the expression level of Akt, mTOR, and PPAR\u03b3 in the heart tissue. However, an HFD significantly increased the expression level of Foxo1 in the HFD group compared to the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, our data showed that the administration of E. billardieri extract significantly enhanced the mRNA levels of Akt, PPAR\u03b3, and mTOR in the heart tissue compared to the HFD group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while it significantly decreased the Foxo1 mRNA levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).", "Given that Akt, mTOR, PPAR\u03b3, and Foxo1 are critical factors in insulin resistance, the present study suggests that E.\u00a0billardieri could probably be used as an alternative treatment for IR as a major feature of metabolic syndrome."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.
