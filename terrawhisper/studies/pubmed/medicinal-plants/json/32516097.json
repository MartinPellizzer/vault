It has been used in both traditional herbal medicines and pharmacological applications. Original research articles and publications on the overview of alkaloids related to this genus are available, but a supportive systematic review account which highlighted phytochemical aspects of other types of secondary metabolites is currently insufficient.", "With the utilization of data and information from SCI-Finder, Google Scholar, the Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Chemical Abstracts, ACS journals, Springer, Taylor Francis, Bentham Science and IOP Science, the reliable material sources of this systematic review paper were obtained from the literature published from the 1980s to now.", "A vast amount of data showed that the non-alkaloidal secondary metabolites were obtained from genus Erythrina with various classes of chemical structures. Herein, approximately five hundred constituents were isolated, comprising flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, phytosterols, phenols, arylbenzofurans, coumarins, alcohols, ceramides, mono-sugars and fatty acid derivatives. In agreement with the previous phytochemical reports on the plants of the family Fabaceae, flavonoids reached a high amount in the plants of genus Erythrina. Numerous biological activity investigations such as anti-bacteria, anti-cancer, anti-virus using isolated compounds from Erythrina species suggested that secondary metabolites of Erythrina plants are now becoming the promising agents for drug developments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioactive Products, Institute of Natural Products Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Cau giay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Ninh T", "Initials": "NT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Compounds Chemistry, National Research Centre, 33 El-Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, 12622, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Elshamy", "ForeName": "Abdelsamed I", "Initials": "AI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytosterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytosterols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32516097", "10.2174/1386207323666200609141517", "CCHTS-EPUB-107215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
