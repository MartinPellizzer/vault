In the present study, six major chemical compounds i.e. rutin, quercetin, lupeol, \u03b2-sitosterol, rotenone, deguelin of therapeutically important plant Tephrosia purpurea were tested for their significance to be used as chemical markers in analytical methods. Plants were collected from different locations. Extraction procedures as well as HPTLC analytical methods have been optimized for each compound. All these methods have been validated in terms of linearity, intraday-interday precision, LOD, LOQ, accuracy and repeatability. Metabolites have been quantified and quantitative data has been subjected to chemometric analysis. Results revealed that Rf values of all the compounds are between 0.3 and 0.4. Rutin, lupeol and \u03b2-sitosterol gave desirable response and other three compounds were found undetectable in HPTLC. Content of rutin, beta-sitosterol and lupeol ranged from 0.095 to 0.84, 0.043 to 0.125, 0.023 to 0.045 w/w % respectively. Among them, rutin content was highest in all samples. Quantitative measurements combined with chemometric analysis displayed chemodiversity in the samples. In addition, principal component analysis ranked the marker as in order of their significance rutin\u202f>\u202f\u03b2-sitosterol\u202f>\u202flupeol. Results indicate rutin to be most preferable chemical marker for the Tephrosia. Furthermore, application of all the three compounds combined as the multimarker system should be preferred for standardization of T. purpurea."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
