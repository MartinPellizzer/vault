Diabetes was induced by injecting streptozotocin (55 mg/kg BW, i.p.) in a citrate buffer. The extract was supplemented in 2.4 g of a DWE/kg diet.", "The DWE supplement significantly decreased the serum glucose concentration in the diabetic rats. The hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase activities significantly increased and the GSH-Px activity decreased in the diabetic rats, compared with the control group. When the DWE supplement was given to the diabetic rats, the antioxidant enzyme activity reverted to near-control values. However, there was no difference in the mRNA expression concentrations of these enzymes between the groups. With regard to the hepatic lipid peroxidation product, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group. However, the DWE supplement lowered the hepatic MDA concentration in the diabetic-induced rats. The DWE supplement also lowered the total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in the serum and hepatic tissue, while increasing the serum HDL-cholesterol in the diabetic rats.", "A DWE supplement can improve the lipid metabolism and is beneficial in preventing diabetic complications from lipid peroxidation and free radicals in diabetic rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Nutrition, Yeungnam University, Kyongsan 712-749, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Soo Yeul", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Ji Yeun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Eun Mi", "Initials": "EM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Myung Sook", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Mi Kyung", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Seon Min", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Moon Kyoo", "Initials": "MK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Myung Joo", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Yong Bok", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "1302422", "ISSNLinking": "0009-8981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11814465", "10.1016/s0009-8981(01)00762-8", "S0009898101007628"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
