Data were collected on 200 patients who, as part of their routine evaluation, provided information regarding their use of herbs. Fifteen percent of patients were currently taking herbs, the majority for treatment of psychiatric symptoms. There were no significant differences in use patterns across gender or between age groups. None of the current users charts, including the \"high risk\" patients, indicated that treating physicians were aware of potentially dangerous drug-herb combinations. Use of herbal medication was common among this sample of psychiatric outpatients. These data are consistent with reports from other patient populations. It is important for psychiatrists to ask all patients about their use of herbs and provide education about potentially dangerous drug-herb interactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA. scmattews@ucsd.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matthews", "ForeName": "Scott C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Camacho", "ForeName": "Alvaro", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lawson", "ForeName": "Kathy", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimsdale", "ForeName": "Joel E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Gen Hosp Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "7905527", "ISSNLinking": "0163-8343"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ambulatory Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12583924", "10.1016/s0163-8343(02)00237-2", "S0163834302002372"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
