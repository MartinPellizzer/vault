The total soluble sugar content corresponded to about 9% of the mature seed weight, about 65% of which was alpha-galactosides. Germination brought about a large decrease in alpha-galactosides: 18% to 40% losses after 3 days and 100% after 6 days. However, glucose, which was not detected in ungerminated seeds, as well as fructose and sucrose gradually increased during germination. The content of alpha-galactosides decreased more rapidly when germinating seeds were given 6 h light per day, but under these conditions there was also a major reduction in the levels of fructose, glucose and sucrose. Seeds rinsed daily showed a greater reduction of alpha-galactosides and an increase in the levels of fructose, glucose and sucrose. When seeds were germinated for 10 days in the dark with daily rinsing, the content of alpha-galactosides decreased gradually during the first 4 days and they were not detected after 6 days. Under these conditions, fructose, glucose and sucrose, which represented about 3% of the mature seed weight, started increasing after day 2 and represented more than 13% of the germinated seed dry weight after 10 days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK."}], "LastName": "Frias", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diaz-Pollan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hedley", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vidal-Valverde", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Lebensm Unters Forsch", "NlmUniqueID": "7509812", "ISSNLinking": "0044-3026"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30237-26-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Disaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sucrase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8717093", "10.1007/BF01229681"]}}]}
