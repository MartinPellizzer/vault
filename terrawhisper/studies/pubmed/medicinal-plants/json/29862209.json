Historically, <i>Allium</i> species have been used as medicinal plants, especially for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases and considered as valuable sources of phytonutrients. Phytochemical investigation of <i>Allium tripedale</i>, locally called \"Anashq,\" which is an edible plant of the \"Zagros\" region (west of Iran) was conducted in the present study.", "Air-dried bulbs of the plant were extracted in a four-step extraction method with increasing polarity using hexane, chloroform, chloroform-methanol (9:1), and methanol. Chloroform-methanol (9:1) extract was fractionated by medium-pressure liquid chromatography on a RP-18 column using a linear gradient solvent system of H<sub>2</sub>O to MeOH. Phenolic-rich fractions were subjected to the final isolation and purification of the constituents by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method. Structure elucidation of the compounds was performed through comprehensive methods including 1D-and 2D-NMR and mass spectroscopy.", "Two cinnamic acid derivatives were isolated from the bulbs of <i>A. tripedale</i>; using spectroscopic methods, their chemical structures were determined as 6,7-dimethoxy N-trans-caffeoyltyramine (1) and N-trans-feruloyltyramine (2).", "Cinnamic acid derivatives are pharmacologically active phenolic compounds, which have been isolated from different <i>Allium</i> species. Isolation of these compounds from <i>A. tripedale</i> is reported for the first time in this study and could be used as a chemical basis for explanation of the plant biological and pharmacological activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Chehri", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zolfaghari", "ForeName": "Behzad", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi Dinani", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Adv Biomed Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101586897", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9175"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Fattorusso E, Iorizzi M, Lanzotti V, Taglialatela-Scafati O.
