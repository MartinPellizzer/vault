The three diets, based on a modified AIN76 rodent diet with fat present at 10 g/100 g dry matter (DM), were as follows: casein with wheat starch (Cas/S) as control, casein with wheat (Cas/W) and chickpeas with wheat (CP/W). All diets were fed from 5 wk of age throughout the 28-wk study. At 28 wk, there was a significantly lower incidence of large intestinal tumors in rats fed Cas/W relative to those fed CP/W ( 11 vs. 56%, chi-square test, P = 0.018). The colonic tumor burden (tumors/tumor-bearing animal) was not different in Cas/W-fed and CP/W-fed rats (1 vs. 1.7), but the tumor mass index was significantly lower in the former group (0.22 vs. 1.21, P = 0.026). Rats fed the CP/W diet had significantly lower plasma cholesterol concentration (P < 0.01) than rats fed the other two diets. The cecal contents of rats fed the CP/W diet had significantly greater relative weights (46%, P < 0.05) than those of the Cas/W-fed rats; this was associated with higher concentrations of all short-chain fatty acids. Fecal analyses showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher concentrations of total fat (54%), total steroids (83%) and secondary bile acids (179%) in the CP/W-fed rats relative those fed Cas/W. There were higher concentrations of nitrogen in the feces of CP/W rats relative to the Cas/W-fed rats (84%, P < 0.05), associated with greater fecal weights (67%, P < 0.05). Although wheat and its fibers have been shown to be protective against DMH-induced cancers in rats, this was not the case in this study in which chickpeas (45 g/100 g diet) provided the protein and were an important source of soluble fiber. Elevated fat, secondary bile acid concentrations and/or nitrogenous compounds could be responsible for the increased colon tumorigenesis seen and may reflect a legume effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Division of Human Nutrition, Adelaide, South Australia 5000."}], "LastName": "McIntosh", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Royle", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caseins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Caseins"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "prevention & control", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9566985", "10.1093/jn/128.5.804"]}}]}
