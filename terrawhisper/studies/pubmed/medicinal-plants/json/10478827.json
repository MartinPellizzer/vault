It reduced about 60-90% of the mutagenicity induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and other heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline(MelQ),2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline(MelQx),3-amino-1,4-dimet hyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-1), 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2),2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1),2-aminodipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-2), at a concentration of 12.5 mg/plate in the Salmonella mutation assay. The extract showed no mutagenicity and no antibacterial activity below this dose. Mutagenicity of methylazoxymethanol (MAM) acetate, which, like PhIP, is a colon carcinogen,was also efficiently inhibited by the roselle extract. To investigate chemoprevention by roselle in a colon carcinogenesis model, we examined the inhibitory effects of the roselle extract in F344 rats in which aberrant crypt focus (ACF) formation was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) and PhIP. In the initiation stage, the number of AOM-induced ACF in the colon was significantly decreased by roselle (17-25%) compared with that in rats treated with AOM alone. The amount of O6-methylguanine in the colonic mucosa tended to be decreased in the roselle-treated rats. The number of PhIP-induced ACF was also significantly decreased by roselle treatment (22%) at a concentration of 1.0 g/kg body weight in the initiation stage. However, in the post-initiation stage of AOM-induced ACF formation, roselle increased the number of ACF, especially the number of foci which had more than three crypts/focus. These results indicate that roselle has antimutagenic activity against MAM acetate and heterocyclic amines and that it decreases the number of AOM- and PhIP-induced ACF in the initiation stage, although it rather increased the number of ACF in the post-initiation stage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bacteriology, School of Medicine, The University of Tokushima, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chewonarin", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kinouchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kataoka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arimochi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuwahara", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vinitketkumnuen", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "909C6UN66T", "NameOfSubstance": "2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MO0N1J0SEN", "NameOfSubstance": "Azoxymethane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azoxymethane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemoprevention"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Malvaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Staging"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10478827", "10.1016/s0278-6915(99)00041-1", "S0278691599000411"]}}]}
