Compounds 1, 9, and 10 contained the unique substituents in Valerianaceae family, such as isovalery and 3-methylcrotonyl. Compound 2 was a 24-nor-ursane triterpenoid. Their structures were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis (UV, IR, MS, 1D and 2D NMR). The inhibitory activities against nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of all triterpenoids were tested. The results showed that compound 4 had moderate inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.1\u03bcM. Furthermore, it also showed strongest inhibitory activities on AChE with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
