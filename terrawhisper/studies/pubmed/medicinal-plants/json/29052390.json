An important approach to increase herbal production is to breed high-yield cultivated variety, which characterized ideal plant morphology. In the present study, we collected 99 wild germplasm resources of P. polyphylla and then measured their 12 main agronomic traits and contents of polyphyllin \u2166,\u2165,\u2161,\u2160. Followed analyses were used to characterize those traits and explore the potential connection with herbal yield or quality. The results showed that: \u2460There was ample morphological diversity in wild P. polyphylla, whose variation of agronomic traits reduced according to followed order: content of polyphyllin, weight of dry rhizome, petiole length, stem length, petal length, pedicel length, sepal length, leaf width, leaf length, sepal width, leaf number, stamen number, petal number. \u2461 Most of those traits were significantly correlated to each other and generally represented the characterization of photosynthetic organs or reproductive organ. \u2462The total content of polyphyllin \u2166,\u2165,\u2161,\u2160varied between 0.02% and 0.87% and averagedat 0.13%, which showed no significant correlation with any agronomic trait. \u2463Plant breeders should play more attention on those germplasm resources with large leaves, large sepals and high stem."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Tong", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Mei-Jie", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maize Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhao-Ling", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Ming-Liang", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for New Rural Development, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Meng-Liang", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29052390", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0057"]}}]}
