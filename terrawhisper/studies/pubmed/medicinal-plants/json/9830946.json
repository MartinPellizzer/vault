There were also the 'ward clowns' who tried to make everyone laugh with their good humour and little pranks, yet felt no less anxious, worried or depressed than anyone else. Patients seem to fit into categories: the nervous ones, the depressives, the jovial types, the moaners, those who demand attention and those who shun it. I feel sure that every nurse has noticed the different 'types' of people who fill hospital beds-ordinary people who seem to take on a new persona as soon as they get into their pyjamas and become a 'patient'. Somehow, their identity gets folded up and put away in their locker along with their outdoor clothes and other reminders of the outside world."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bach Centre, Oxon, UK."}], "LastName": "Howard", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery", "NlmUniqueID": "9506953", "ISSNLinking": "1353-6117"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Homeopathy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Personality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sick Role"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperament"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Bach", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9830946", "10.1016/s1353-6117(98)80090-5"]}}]}
