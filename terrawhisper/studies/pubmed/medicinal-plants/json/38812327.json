The rapid characterization of <i>E. ulmoides</i> gene function has been severely hampered by the limitations of genetic transformation methods and breeding cycles. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-mediated protoplast transformation system is a multifunctional and rapid tool for the analysis of functional genes <i>in vivo</i>, but it has not been established in <i>E. ulmoides</i>.", "In this study, a large number of highly active protoplasts were isolated from the stems of <i>E. ulmoides</i> seedlings by enzymatic digestion, and green fluorescent protein expression was facilitated using a PEG-mediated method.", "Optimal enzymatic digestion occurred when the enzyme was digested for 10 h in an enzymatic solution containing 2.5% Cellulase R-10 (w/v), 0.6% Macerozyme R-10 (w/v), 2.5% pectinase (w/v), 0.5% hemicellulase (w/v), and 0.6 mol/L mannitol. The active protoplast yield under this condition was 1.13 \u00d7 106 protoplasts/g fresh weight, and the protoplast activity was as high as 94.84%.", "This study established the first protoplasm isolation and transient transformation system in hard rubber wood, which lays the foundation for subsequent functional studies of <i>E. ulmoides</i> genes to achieve high-throughput analysis, and provides a reference for future gene function studies of medicinal and woody plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
