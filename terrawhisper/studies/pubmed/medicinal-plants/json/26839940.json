Objective This study investigates the chemopreventive effect of yellow tea aqueous extract against N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced liver carcinogenesis in rats by employing histological and biochemical methods. Materials and methods Wistar rats were divided randomly into four groups: control (I), yellow tea (II), NDEA (III), and yellow tea\u2009+\u2009NDEA (IV). Groups II and IV were exposed via a diet to yellow tea extract in a concentration of 10\u2009g/kg feed; groups III and IV received 0.01% NDEA in drinking water. The experiment lasted for 13 weeks. Results Daily intake of yellow tea in an average dose of 800\u2009mg/kg b.w. alleviated the carcinogenic effect of NDEA as evidenced by reversed histopathological changes towards normal hepatocellular architecture and decreased lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl formation, and DNA degradation by 64%, 37% and 15%, respectively, as compared with values obtained in NDEA alone-treated rats. Treatment with yellow tea extract caused protection of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT); their activity was recovered by 47% and 12%, respectively, as compared with the NDEA-treated rats. Moreover, the extract normalized the NDEA-induced activity of paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), while a further increase in the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was noticed. Conclusions On the basis of these findings, it can be concluded that treatment with yellow tea partially protected the livers of rats from NDEA-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and that its antioxidant activity contributed to this effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Toxicology , Poznan University of Medical Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland ;"}], "LastName": "Kujawska", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Toxicology , Poznan University of Medical Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland ;"}], "LastName": "Ewertowska", "ForeName": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Toxicology , Poznan University of Medical Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland ;"}], "LastName": "Adamska", "ForeName": "Teresa", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry , Poznan University of Medical Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland ;"}], "LastName": "Ignatowicz", "ForeName": "Ewa", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Faculty of Food Science and Nutrition , Pozna\u0144 University of Life Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland."}], "LastName": "Gramza-Micha\u0142owska", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Toxicology , Poznan University of Medical Sciences , Pozna\u0144 , Poland ;"}], "LastName": "Jodynis-Liebert", "ForeName": "Jadwiga", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IQ78TTX1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Diethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Carbonylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26839940", "10.3109/13880209.2015.1137600"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
