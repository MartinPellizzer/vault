Admitted to the study were patients in phases I and II who had been referred to the clinic in order to evaluate up the indication for operation. Concerning subjective complaints there was an improvement in dysuric symptoms in both patient groups. The evaluation of the objective parameters showed significant differencies. There was a statistically highly significant (p = 0.0005) decrease of the sex hormone binding globulin in the group of patients treated with ERU as well as a significant improvement of the micturition volume and maximum urinary flow. The improvement of the average flow in the ERU group was not significant. The increase of residual urine volume in both groups seems not to be significant according to the Covariance-analysis and is difficult to interpret. It is assumed, that, up to a certain grade, for a selected group of patients, mainly in the phase of beginning decompensation, length and dosage of therapy were possibly not sufficiently adjusted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vontobel", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Herzog", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rutishauser", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kres", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Ergebnisse einer Doppelblindstudie \u00fcber die Wirksamkeit von ERU-Kapseln in der konservativen Behandlung der benignen Prostatahyperplasie."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Urologe A", "NlmUniqueID": "1304110", "ISSNLinking": "0340-2592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatic Hyperplasia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Urodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2580383"]}}]}
