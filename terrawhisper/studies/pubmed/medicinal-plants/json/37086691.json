Recent studies have proposed that GABA alleviates plant nitrogen (N) deficient stress; however, the mechanism by which GABA mediates plant N deficiency adaptation remains not yet well understood. Herein we found in a medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata that 5\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> exogenous GABA promoted plant growth under N deficient (1\u00a0mmol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) condition, with remarkably increments in total N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> concentrations in plants. GABA increased N assimilation and protein synthesis by up-regulating the activities and expression of N metabolic enzymes. GABA also increased the accumulation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate and malate, which could facilitate the assimilation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. Inhibition of NR by Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> counteracted the promoting effects of GABA on plant growth, and the effects of GABA were not affected by L-DABA and 3-MP, the inhibitors of GABA transaminase (GABA-T) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), respectively. These results suggested that the nutritional role of GABA was excluded in promoting plant growth under low N condition. The results of <sup>15</sup>N isotopic tracing and NRTs transcription indicated that exogenous GABA could up-regulate NRT2.4 and NRT3.2 to increase plant NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake under N deficient condition. Interestingly, primidone, an inhibitor of GABA receptor, impeded the effects of GABA on plant growth and N accumulation. Thus, our results revealed that exogenous GABA acted as a signal to up-regulate NRTs via its receptor to increase NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, and subsequently promoted NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> assimilation to alleviate N deficiency in A. paniculata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
