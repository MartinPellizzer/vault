The agricultural soil was defined as long-term contaminated as As (1540mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), Cd (55mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) and Pb (1283mgkg<sup>-1</sup>) concentrations exceeded the Korean guideline values for As (25mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), Cd (4mgkg<sup>-1</sup>), and Pb (200mgkg<sup>-1</sup>). Gypsum was incorporated into the contaminated soil at 3% (w/w). In comparison two commonly using immobilizing agents (lime and compost), together with a mixture (lime+gypsum) were also included in the pot trial for the cultivation of two medical plants (A. gigas and A. macrocephala) and to evaluate the effectiveness of gypsum on As, Cd and Pb immobilization. The results showed that even though pH change-induced immobilizing agents such as lime were more effective than gypsum at immobilizing Cd and Pb, addition of gypsum also effectively reduced heavy metal phytoavailability as indicated by decreases in the concentration of Cd and Pb in medicinal plants. Furthermore, gypsum and gypsum+ lime were also most effective in reducing As concentrations in both plants studied. This was mainly attributed to significant decreases in soil DOC (48-64%) when gypsum and gypsum+lime were applied to the soil. Consequently, it was concluded that enhanced DOC coagulation with gypsum, could be considered as a promising technique for the immobilization of both metals (Cd and Pb) and metalloids (As) in agricultural soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
