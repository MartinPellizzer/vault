The extract was fractionated by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column as MDE1-5 fractions. The fractions of MDE3 and MDE4 composed of mainly D-galacturonic acid and a small amount of neutral sugar (L-arabinose as the major one and L-rhamnose and D-galactose as the minor ones) were studied for immunopharmacological activities by phagocytic test to intracellular bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis) and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and superoxide generation tests. The results showed that the number of S. enteritidis in cultured monocyte with extract of pericarb of mangosteen (MDE3) was killed. Activating score (mean +/- SD) of NBT test of 100 polymorphonuclear phagocytic cells were 145 +/- 78, 338 +/- 58, 222 +/- 73, 209 +/- 77, 211 +/- 63, 372 +/- 19, 369 +/- 20, 355 +/- 34 in normal saline control, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), MDE3, MDE4, indomethacin (I), PMA + MDE3, PMA + MDE4 and PMA + I, respectively. Superoxide generation test was also done by color reduction of cytochrome c. Both MDE3 and MDE4 stimulate superoxide production. The number of S. enteritidis in cultured monocyte with extract of pericarb of mangosteen was killed. This paper suggests that polysaccharides in the extract can stimulate phagocytic cells and kill intracellular bacteria (S. enteritidis)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Microscopy, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Chanarat", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chanarat", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujihara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagumo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "J Med Assoc Thai", "NlmUniqueID": "7507216", "ISSNLinking": "0125-2208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella enteritidis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9347663"]}}]}
