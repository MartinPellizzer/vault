Prevention of relapse and reduction of withdrawal symptoms are still the major limitations in the current pharmacological treatments of drug addiction. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of essential oils extracted from Elsholtzia ciliata, Shinchim, Angelicae gigantis Radix, and Eugenia caryophyllata, well-known traditional Korean medicines for addiction, on the modulation of dopamine system in amphetamine-treated cells and to explore the possible mechanism underlying its therapeutic effect. The potential cytotoxic effect of essential oils was evaluated in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells using cell viability assays. Quantification of DAT, p-CREB, p-MAPK, and p-Akt was done by immunoblotting. DAT was significantly reduced in cells treated with 50\u2009\u03bcM of amphetamine in a time-dependent manner. No significant toxicity of essential oils from Elsholtzia ciliata and Shinchim was observed at doses of 10, 25, and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL. However, essential oils from A. gigantis Radix at a dose of 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL and E. caryophyllata at doses of 50 and 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL showed cytotoxicity. Treatment with GBR 12909, a highly selective DAT inhibitor, significantly increased DAT expression compared with that of amphetamine only by enhancing phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and Akt. In addition, essential oils effectively induced hyperphosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), MAPK, and Akt, which resulted in DAT upregulation. Our study implies that the essential oils may rehabilitate brain dopamine function through increased DAT availability in abstinent former drug users."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Traditional Korean Medicine, Dongguk University , Gyeongju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Min Sun", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Traditional Korean Medicine, Dongguk University , Gyeongju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Bang-sub", "Initials": "BS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Traditional Korean Medicine, Dongguk University , Gyeongju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sang Heon", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 School of Biomedical Sciences, Charles Sturt University , Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia ."}], "LastName": "Pak", "ForeName": "Sok Cheon", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Otoalaryngology, Chonnam National University Medical School , Gwangju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Chul Ho", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University-Seoul , Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Chin", "ForeName": "Young-Won", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Department of Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, Dongguk University-Seoul , Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young-Mi", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, College of Traditional Korean Medicine, Dongguk University , Gyeongju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Dong-il", "Initials": "DI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Dongguk University Research Institute of Biotechnology , Seoul, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Songhee", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Traditional Korean Medicine, Dongguk University , Gyeongju, Republic of Korea ."}], "LastName": "Koo", "ForeName": "Byung-Soo", "Initials": "BS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Gland Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pheochromocytoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26295793", "10.1089/jmf.2015.3475"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
