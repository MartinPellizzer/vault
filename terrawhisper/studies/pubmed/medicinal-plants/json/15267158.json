Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with benzyladenine (BA; 8.87 microM) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA; 2.46 microM) was optimal for axillary bud proliferation, which developed a mean of 8.3 shoots/node. Excision and culture of node segments from in vitro shoots on medium supplemented with the same concentration of growth regulators developed more than 30 shoots within 40 days. Excision and culture of nodes in succession enhanced the number of shoots. Shoot multiplication did not exhibit decrease in the number of shoots even at 10th subculture. Nevertheless, the shoots exhibited a tendency towards stunted nature. But reduction of BA to 4.44 or 2.22 microM resumed normal growth of shoots. Half strength MS medium fortified with IBA (2.46 microM) induced the highest number of roots. All in vitro rooted shoots survived in field. Dipping of the basal end of shoots collected from multiplication medium in IBA (2.46 microM) solution for 7 days induced roots and its transfer to small pots facilitated the survival of all rooted shoots (100%). Rooting ex vitro by direct transfer of shoots from multiplication medium exhibited 89.2 per cent survival. Use of commercial sugar and tap water and also the omission of in vitro rooting reduce the propagation cost 50-70 per cent. The protocol enables to harvest more than 50,000 plantlets within 150 days starting from a single node explant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Calicut, Calicut 673 635, India. marttin@sify.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "K P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Beena", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "Dominic", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Wedelia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15267158"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
