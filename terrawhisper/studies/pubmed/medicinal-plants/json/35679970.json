Frank (Didymellaceae). Their structures were determined mainly by NMR, HR-ESI-MS spectral and X-ray diffraction experiments. Betaethrins D-I possessed different fatty acid chains connected with the B-ring, which was the first report in all DPEs. The shielding effect of the B-ring on H-6 (A-ring) in methyl barceloneate, betaethrin A and betaethrins D-F (asterric acid analogs) was first observed and analyzed, which could differentiate the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR chemical shift values of H-4/H-6 without the assistance of 3-OH. An empirical rule was then suggested: the steric hindrance between the A- and B-rings in asterric acid analogs might prevent these two aromatic rings from rotating freely, which led to the <sup>1</sup>H-NMR chemical shift value of H-6 being in the high field zone due to the shielding effect of the B-ring on H-6. Based on the empirical rule, the chemical shift values of the A-ring in methyl barceloneate were revised. The possible biosynthesis of these isolates was postulated. Betaethrin H showed moderate cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cell lines. Betaethrins A-F, H and I displayed strong antioxidant activities. These results further implied that endophytic fungi from unique environments, such as desert plants, with few chemical studies are an important resource of undescribed and bioactive metabolites."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
