The aims of this study were to collect information concerning the traditional use of medicinal plants in the region of Tafila; identify the most important medicinal plants; determine the relative importance of the species surveyed; and calculate the informant consensus factor (<i>F</i><sub>ic</sub>) in relation to medicinal plant use.", "Data on the traditional medicinal uses of local plants were collected using qualitative tools.

Problems of the digestive system had the highest <i>F</i><sub>ic</sub> values, while <i>Allium cepa</i> L. and <i>Matricaria aurea</i> (Loefl.) Sch. Bip. scored the highest UV.", "The medicinal plants used by local people of the Tafila area of Jordan their traditional uses were investigated. forty one plant species are still in use in Tafila for the traditional treatment of various diseases. The preservation of this knowledge is important not only for maintaining cultural and traditional resources but also as a resource for the future identification of leads for drug development. The use of Fic and the UV to identify plant species that are consistently used in the treatment of specific ailments assists in narrowing down the search for new effective plant-derived medicines and in validating the use of traditional medicines. Data on the traditional medicinal uses of local plants was collected using qualitative tools. The informant consensus factor (Fic) for category of aliments and the use value (UV) of the plant species were calculated. in the Tafila region, the Fic values are relatively low, indicating a low level of shared knowledge and that a number of different species are used to treat similar disorders. This may be a result of the great diversity of vegetation types found across the Tafila region, with the specific plant chosen being dependent on the species most readily available in the different vegetation zones. Interestingly, however, the UVs calculated for a number of species in the Tafila region are relatively high, compared with those recorded in other areas of Jordan. These high UVs indicate that despite the diversity of vegetation types across the Tafila region, a number of plants are highly valued for medicinal use throughout the whole region. This study contributes to the body of knowledge about the use of plants in traditional medicine, helping to document and maintain the knowledge that has been traditionally passed directly from person to person. The preservation of this knowledge is important not only for maintaining cultural and traditional resources but also as a resource for the future identification of leads for drug development. Problems of the digestive system had the highest Fic values, while <i>Allium cepa</i> L. and <i>Matricaria aurea</i> (Loefl.) Sch. Bip. scored the highest UV. Comparison with other ethnopharmacological studies in the region found consensus about many of the uses reported, and also identified localized uses of some species. Experimental evidence from the literature offered support for many of the reported uses. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> F<sub>ic</sub>: Informants consensus factor, n<sub>ur</sub>: number of use reports per each category, n<sub>t</sub>: number of taxa used, UV: use value of a species, U: number of uses per species, n: number of informants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science, Taibah University, Almadinah Almunawarrah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdelhalim", "ForeName": "Abeer", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Aburjai", "ForeName": "Talal", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia."}], "LastName": "Hanrahan", "ForeName": "Jane", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of Petra, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Halim", "ForeName": "Heba", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Saad B, Azaizeh H, Said O.
