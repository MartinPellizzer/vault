After a relaxation of drug control laws in Thailand, its use re-emerged. This study examines the Suk-Saiyasna remedy's impact on rodent behavior and its receptor effects. This study was conducted to assess the sedative-like effects of the remedy on mice. The mice were divided into groups receiving 0.6, 3, 30, and 60 mg/kg extracts, with negative controls for comparison. We also investigated the impact on receptors, utilizing negative controls and pretreatment with receptor blockers, followed by either a negative control or a 60 mg/kg extract. Furthermore, this study investigated the behavioral aspects of mice, including anxiolytic effects, antidepressant-like effects, and motor coordination, utilizing the elevated plus-maze, open-field, and rotarod performance tests. The Suk-Saiyasna remedy (<i>P</i> < 0.05) decreased significantly in the latent period and increased sleeping time in the treated groups. Moreover, the Suk-Saiyasna remedy also showed efficacy in reaction to GABAA receptors and cannabinoid CB1 receptors (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In addition, positive effects were observed regarding the animal behavior in the arena, as the animal activity, behavior, and muscle coordination were reduced (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The Suk-Saiyasna remedy may be involved in a sedative-hypnotic-like effect in rodents under normal conditions through the modulation of GABAergic neurons and induction of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Integrative Medicine, Faculty of Integrative Medicine, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Damjuti", "ForeName": "Watchara", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence in DNA Barcoding of Thai Medicinal Plants, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Thitikornpong", "ForeName": "Worathat", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production Technology and Animal Health Science, Faculty of Agricultural Technology, Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Saengow", "ForeName": "Sinsamut", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chulalongkorn University Drugs and Health Product Innovation Promotion Centre, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Thanusuwannasak", "ForeName": "Thanundorn", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Rangsit University, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Fuangfoo", "ForeName": "Thanes", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Thai Traditional Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Boonruab", "ForeName": "Jurairat", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Li HL.
