Seventy-two male Wistar Furth rats were equally divided into four groups as follow: controls (CON), untreated burn-wound rats (BURN), normal saline-treated burn-wound rats (BURN-NSS) and Aloe vera-treated burn-wound rats (BURN-ALOE). The animals in each group were equally subdivided into three subgroups for the study on day 3, 7 and 14 post-burn. Dorsal skinfold chamber preparation and intravital fluorescence microscopic technique were performed to examine leukocyte adhesion on postcapillary venules. ELISA techniques were performed to examine serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. It was found that the amount of leukocyte adhesion was significantly reduced in the BURN-ALOE group compared to rats in the BURN group on day 14. Levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were also decreased significantly compared to BURN at all three monitored time points. Aloe vera could inhibit the inflammatory process following burn injury, as characterized by the reduction of leukocyte adhesion, as well as those pro-inflammatory cytokines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inter-Department of Physiology, Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duansak", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Somboonwong", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Patumraj", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Hemorheol Microcirc", "NlmUniqueID": "9709206", "ISSNLinking": "1386-0291"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred WF"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14724347"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
