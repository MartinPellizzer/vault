Growing of drugs resistance in parasites is one of the most threats to malaria control. The aim of study was to investigate the anti-malarial activity of nano-emodin isolated from <i>Rhamnus cathartica</i> on <i>Plasmodium berghei</i> in mice to evaluate parasites inhibition rate using <i>in-vivo</i> test.", "The study was conducted in the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, during 2020. Nano-emodin particles were prepared from <i>Rhamnus cathartica,</i> and confirmed by Zeta Potential Analyzer, DLS and electron microscopy techniques. Mice were infected with <i>P. berghei</i> and treated by emodin nano-particles. Parasitemia was evaluated in each group in comparison with control group. Toxicity test was done using twice the highest concentration of emodin extract on a separate group of mice and ED50 was calculated.", "Emodin extract was significantly effective in all concentrations on D4 <i>(P</i><0.05). The most effective on parasitemia was observed in 400 mg/kg of Liquid Nano-emodin and solid (non-Nano) emodin. ED50 for emodin extract was determined 220 mg/kg. Toxicity test showed no toxic effect on the subjects.", "The emodin extract is safe, lack of side effects. So, it can be used for more and longer period of time and in higher doses. Emodin extract, either in form of liquid and nanoparticle or in a solid form, has the same therapeutic effect on <i>P. berghei</i> in infected Balb/c mice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Bayat et al.
