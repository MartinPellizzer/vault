Further pharmacological studies on its extracts revealed that they possess cytotoxic activity against certain cancer cells, however, there were no studies conducted on the anticancer potential of Artemisia sieberi essential oil (ASEO).", "To evaluate the anticancer potential of ASEO, elucidate the oil's mode of action for the first time and investigate its chemical composition.", "Artemisia sieberi was collected from Hail, Saudi Arabia, and its essential oil was obtained via hydrodistillation. The oil's activity against HCT116, HepG2, A549 and MCF-7\u00a0cells was assessed using SRB assay, while its anti-metastatic potential was assessed via a migration assay. Cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assay were conducted via flow cytometry, while protein expression levels were investigated using Western blotting. The oil's chemical constituents were identified using GCMS.", "ASEO exerted its highest cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 38.7\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Further studies showed that the oil inhibited MCF-7\u00a0cells' migration, induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed no change in the expression level of caspase-3 after treatment, indicating the induction of caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death in MCF-7. Treatment of MCF-7 with the oil resulted in downregulation of the protein expression levels of total ERK and its downstream target, LC3, indicating that any potential activation of the ERK signalling pathway during the cancer cells' growth would be inhibited. Finally, GCMS analysis identified the oil's major components as cis-crysanthenyl acetate (48.56%), davanone (10.28%), 1,8-cineole (6.81%) and caryophyllene diepoxide (5.34%), whereby it is suggested that these compounds might be responsible for the oil's bioactivity.", "ASEO possessed in vitro anticancer activity and modulated the ERK signalling pathway. This is the first study to explore the anticancer potential of ASEO in detail and reflects the significance of investigating essential oils from medicinal plants that have been traditionally used against cancer. This work might pave the way for further in vivo studies that could result in developing the oil into a natural effective anticancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
