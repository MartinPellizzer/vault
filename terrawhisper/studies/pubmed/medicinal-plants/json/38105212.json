Despite being tropical natives, they are now widespread. Due to its medicinal and commercial importance, this family of plants attracted a lot of attention in the scientific community. The distinctive characteristic of the family is production of milky latex, which is a rich source of several lectins, the proteins that bind carbohydrates. Although their function is unclear, they are believed to defend plants against damaging phytopathogenic microorganisms, insects, and predatory animals. Additionally, they serve as crucial metabolic regulators under a variety of stressors. Detection, separation, purification, and characterization of lectins from the Euphorbiaceae family - mostly from the latex of plants - began over 40 years ago. This effort produced over 35 original research papers that were published. However, no systematic review that compiles these published data has been presented yet. This review summarizes and describes several procedures and protocols employed for extraction and purification of lectins belonging to this family. Physicochemical properties and biological activities of the lectins, along with their medicinal and pharmacological properties, have also been analyzed. Additionally, using examples of ricin and ricin agglutinin, we have structurally analyzed characteristics of the lectin known as Ribosome Inactivating Protein Type II (RIP-Type II) that belongs to this family. We anticipate that this review article will offer a useful compendium of information on this important family of lectins, show the scientists involved in lectin research the gaps in our knowledge, and offer insights for future research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Africa City of Technology (ACT), Khartoum, Sudan. ehkonozy@yahoo.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research and Development Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Karary University, Omdurman, Khartoum State, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Konozy", "ForeName": "Emadeldin Hassan E", "Initials": "EHE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Africa City of Technology (ACT), Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Osman", "ForeName": "Makarim Elfadil M", "Initials": "MEM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal, Aromatic Plants, and Traditional Medicine Research Institute (MAPTRI), National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Dirar", "ForeName": "Amina I", "Initials": "AI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry (Mosc)", "NlmUniqueID": "0376536", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2979"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9009-86-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ricin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ricin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38105212", "10.1134/S0006297923110238", "BCM88119999"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
