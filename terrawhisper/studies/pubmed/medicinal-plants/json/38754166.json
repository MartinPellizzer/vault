Ensuring the authenticity of tuna species is crucial for protecting both consumers and tuna stocks. In this study, GC-Q-TOF and UPLC-Q/Orbitrap mass spectrometry-based metabolomics were used to investigate the metabolite profiles of three commercial tuna species (skipjack tuna, bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna). A total of 22 and 77 metabolites were identified with high confidence using GC-Q-TOF and UPLC-Q/Orbitrap mass spectrometry, respectively. Further screening via chemometrics revealed that 38 metabolites could potentially serve as potential biomarkers. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the screened metabolite biomarkers successfully distinguished the three tested tuna species. Furthermore, a total of 27 metabolic pathways were identified through enrichment analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
