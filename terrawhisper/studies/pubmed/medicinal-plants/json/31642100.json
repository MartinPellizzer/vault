In this study, we aimed to examine protective properties of AKBA against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. To investigate the effects of AKBA (2.5-10\u2009\u00b5M) on glutamate injury in neuron-like cells PC12 and N2a, two treatment regimens (incubation for 2 or 0\u2009hours before glutamate exposure) were used. Then, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method was used to determine viability of the cells. Cellular redox status was evaluated using fluorimetry and comet assays. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and Western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins were conducted. Based on the results, 24\u2009hours incubation with glutamate (8\u2009mM) increased the cell mortality of PC12 and N2a (P\u2009<\u2009.001). However, AKBA (2.5-10\u2009\u00b5M) enhanced the cell viability in both treatment regimens (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Also co- and pretreatment with AKBA significantly attenuated lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species production, and DNA injury (P\u2009<\u2009.05 and P\u2009<\u2009.001). AKBA also restored the activity of cellular superoxide dismutase under glutamate toxicity; this effect was seen to be more significant during the pretreatment regimen (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Moreover, Western blot analysis indicated that AKBA inhibited glutamate-induced programmed cell death through depressing the elevation of the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved-caspase-3 proteins, concentration-dependently. Overall, the present findings suggest the neuroprotective activities of AKBA against glutamate-induced cell injury probably by inhibiting oxidative damage and reducing apoptotic cell death."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5956-3471"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Retracted Publication"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "acetyl-11-ketoboswellic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Cell Biochem. 2024 Jul 16:e30625. doi: 10.1002/jcb.30625", "PMID": "39011774"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Gland Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Pheochromocytoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kritis AA, Stamoula EG, Paniskaki KA, Vavilis TD.
