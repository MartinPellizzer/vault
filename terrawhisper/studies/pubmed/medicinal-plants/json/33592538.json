W. cocos in Yunnan is collected from the wild and is cultivated in field conditions and the wood substrate used is derived from the local pine (Pinus yunnanensis Franch.) logs from neighborhood forests. The outer part of sclerotia was found to be richer than the inner one in both <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>K with median values of 7.3 and 3.2 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (dw) for <sup>137</sup>Cs, 220 and 140 Bq kg<sup>-1</sup> dw for <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>K. The median K concentrations were 6800\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> dw in the outer and 3700\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> dw in the inter parts. No statistically significant correlation was found for activity concentrations between the inner and outer parts, both for <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>4</sup><sup>0</sup>K (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Using the median activities of <sup>137</sup>Cs, the nominal values of effective dose (mSv) for exposed adults annually consuming 50\u00a0g of sclerotia, were estimated at 0.0035\u00a0mSv and 0.084\u00a0mSv (outer part), and 0.0020\u00a0mSv and 0.040\u00a0mSv (inner part) per capita, respectively.
