The stability of the extract in water and alcoholic solutions was also investigated. There were five major components in allicin extract which were all identified as thiosulfinates. The extract was stable for at least 3 months when stored at -20 degrees C as water solution, but obvious decomposition was observed with the increase of alcoholic concentration. The decomposition products were also identified by HPLC-MS/MS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hang", "ForeName": "Tai-jun", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zheng-xing", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiosulfates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiosulfates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19350826"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
