Human maxillary anterior teeth were prepared with protaper rotary files, followed by incubation with standard broth of <i>E. faecalis</i>. A total of 140 teeth were included in the study. These teeth are randomized and equally divided into seven groups and were treated with low (1.25 \u03bcl) and high doses (2.5 \u03bcl) of essential oils of vetiver and chamomile and calcium hydroxide (0.1/1.0 mL), 2% chlorhexidine (2.5 \u03bcl).
