The tested microbial species included B. subtilis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and C. albicans. The crude methanolic extract was applied in two different concentrations of 1 and 2mg disc1. Analysis of the data revealed that crude methanolic extracted samples showed different ranges of antimicrobial activities against all the tested microbes at both concentrations. Maximum growth inhibition was measured against gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by the fungal specie Candida albicans. In case of Petroleum extracted fractions maximum growth reduction was measured in Candida albicans at higher concentration. Similarly, growth inhibition was more in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at higher concentration of aqueous extracted samples. Different solvent extracted samples showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, proteins, fats, oils, tannins, carbohydrates, sterols and saponins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bakht", "ForeName": "Jehan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Islamia College Peshawar, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Arshad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Litsea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081760"]}}]}
