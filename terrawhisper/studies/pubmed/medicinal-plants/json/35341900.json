Herein, we propose a regulatory hydrogel depot toward metastatic cancer by establishing mathematical models between tumor characteristics and administration regimens. Specifically, a thermo-sensitive PLGA-PEG-PLGA polymer is introduced as injectable hydrogel matrix, of which the administration volume and frequency are manipulated elaborately according to tumor size and gel-degradation kinetics. Structurally, doxorubicin (Dox) and arginine-terminated nanoparticles containing KIAA1199 specific shRNA (<sup>shKIAA</sup>RPDNs) are incorporated into hydrogels, thereby formulating a topical and sustained drug depot to achieve synergy treatment. For dual-targeting therapy, Dox interdicts DNA replication/transcription, and shKIAA persistently silences KIAA1199 protein to modulate aggressive phenotypes. After individual peritumoral injection, Gel/<sup>shKIAA</sup>RPDNs/Dox demonstrates desirable distribution patterns and gel degradation kinetics with enhanced tumor penetration. Moreover, a preferable inhibition of tumor proliferation and metastasis is confirmed after twice treatment in 12\u00a0days, indicating better therapeutic efficacy with less dosage and frequency. Consequently, the controllable administration regimen inspired mathematical models of thermosensitive hydrogel provides an intelligent platform for personalized treatment to metastatic cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
