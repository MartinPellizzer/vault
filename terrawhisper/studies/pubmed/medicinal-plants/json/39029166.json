Enzymatic treatment for degradation of antibiotics from environmental matrices is a green and sustainable approach. Focusing on this, this study aimed to degrade two frequently found fluroquinolone emergent pollutants, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin from wastewater. The trinuclear cluster of copper ions present in laccase has the ability to effectively remove organic micropollutants (OMPs). The uniqueness of this study is that it utilizes laccase enzyme extracted from spent mushroom waste (SMW) of P. florida for degradation of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin and to achieve highest degradation efficiency various parameters were tweaked such as pH (3-6), temperature (30\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b0C), and ABTS (0.05, 0.6, and 1\u00a0mM) concentration. The results showed that the most effective degradation of ciprofloxacin (86.12-75.94%) and norfloxacin (83.27-65.94%) was achieved in 3\u00a0h at pH 4.5, temperature 30\u00a0\u00b0C, and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 0.05\u00a0mM concentration. Nevertheless, achieving degradation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C for both antibiotics, indicates thermostability nature of laccase (P. florida). Further, the fate of transformed products obtained from laccase mediated degradation was confirmed by liquid chromatography (LC-MS). Both the antibiotics undergo decarboxylation, depiperylyzation, dealkylation and defluorination as a result of laccase-mediated bond breakage. Anti-microbial activity of the biodegraded products was monitored by residual anti-bacterial toxicity test (E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The biodegraded products were found to be non-toxic and resulted in the growth of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as determined by the agar-diffusion method. Moreover, the storage stability of laccase was determined for 28-day duration at varying pH (3-10) and temperature (4-50\u00a0\u00b0C). The maximum storage stability was obtained at pH 4.5 and temperature 30\u00a0\u00b0C. Therefore, utilizing SMW for the degradation of OMPs from wastewater not only benefits in degradation but also reuses SMW agro waste, shedding light on agro waste management. Thus, SMW is a one-pot solution for both OMPs biodegradation and circularity in the economy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
