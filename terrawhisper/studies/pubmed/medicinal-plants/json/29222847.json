Norsufentanil was reacted with succinic anhydride to produce the corresponding carboxylic acid. The resulting carboxylic acid has undergone a multicomponent reaction with different aldehydes, amines, and isocyanides to produce a library of the desired compounds. In all cases, amide bond rotation was observed in the NMR spectra. In vivo analgesic activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated by a tail flick test. Very encouraging results were obtained for a number of the synthesized products. Some of the synthesized compounds such as 5a, 5b, 5h, 5j, and 5r were found to be more potent than sufentanil, sufentanil citrate, and norsufentanil. Binding modes between the compounds and mu and delta-opioid receptors were studied by molecular docking method. The relationship between the molecular structural features and the analgesic activity was investigated by a quantitative structure-activity relationship model. The results of the molecular modeling studies and the in vivo analgesic activity suggested that the majority of the synthesized compounds were more potent than sufentanil and norsufentanil."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nami", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5774-3372"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chemistry, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dabiri", "ForeName": "Minoo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bararjanian", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Drug Design (LBD), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gharaghani", "ForeName": "Sajjad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khoramjouy", "ForeName": "Mona", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "UoN Chair of Oman`S Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural, University of Nizwa, Nizwa, Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faizi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101262549", "ISSNLinking": "1747-0277"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Opioid, delta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Opioid, mu"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "norsufentanil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36B82AMQ7N", "NameOfSubstance": "Naloxone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AFE2YW0IIZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Sufentanil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Naloxone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Tertiary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Opioid, delta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Opioid, mu"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sufentanil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29222847", "10.1111/cbdd.13157"]}}]}
