(DBL) is one of traditional Chinese medicines and has been used for the treatment of goiter, tumor and carbuncles. However, clinic application of the herbal medicine has been limited, due to reported severe hepatotoxicity. 8-Epidiosbulbin E acetate (EEA), one of the major components of DBL, can cause severe liver damage. The furan ring of EEA is metabolized by CYP3A4 to a cis-enedial reactive intermediate prone to react amino and/or thiol groups of amino acid residues. In this study, we investigated the interaction of the reactive intermediate with biologic amines. EEA-derived biologic amine adducts, including spermidine, spermine, putrescine, ornithine, lysine and glutamine were detected in cultured mouse primary hepatocytes treated with EEA. Only spermidine adduct was observed in bile of mice given EEA. The detection of the adducts was established by labeling with bromobenzyl mercaptan and LC-MS/MS analysis. Exposure of EEA resulted in concentration dependent cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. Pretreatment with spermidine attenuated the susceptibility of cells to the cytotoxicity of EEA, because of the compensation of the depleted spermidine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
