A particular focus lies on metal oxide nanoparticles, which boast distinctive physicochemical attributes on the nanoscale. Of note, green synthesis has emerged as a promising avenue, leveraging plant extracts as both reduction and capping agents. This approach offers environmentally friendly and cost-effective avenues for generating monodispersed nanoparticles with precise morphologies.", "In this investigation, we embarked on the synthesis of Bismuth oxide nanoparticles, both in their pure form and doped with silver (Ag) and copper (Cu). This synthesis harnessed the potential of Biebersteinia multifida extract as a versatile reducing agent. To comprehensively characterize the synthesized nanoparticles, a suite of analytical techniques was employed, including energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.", "The synthesized nanoparticles underwent a rigorous assessment. Their antibacterial attributes were probed, revealing a pronounced enhancement in antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria upon metal nanoparticle doping. Furthermore, their potential for combating cancer was scrutinized, with the nanoparticles exhibiting selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, U87, compared to normal 3T3 cells. Notably, among the doped nanoparticles, Cu-doped variants demonstrated the highest potency, further underscoring their promising potential.", "In conclusion, the present study underscores the efficacy of green synthesized Bismuth oxide nanoparticles, particularly those doped with Ag and Cu, in augmenting antibacterial efficacy, bolstering biofilm inhibition, and manifesting selective cytotoxicity against cancer cells. These findings portend a promising trajectory for these nanoparticles in the spheres of biomedicine and therapeutics. As we look ahead, a deeper elucidation of their mechanistic underpinnings and in vivo investigations are essential to fully unlock their potential for forthcoming biomedical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier GmbH.
