High volume trade of this potential medicinal plant species led to unscrupulous adulteration of both crude drugs as well as formulations. Morphology-based authentication is difficult in cases of incomplete or damaged samples and in dried herbal materials. In such cases, PCR-based molecular methods may aid in accurate identification. The present study aimed at developing species-specific DNA marker(s) for the authentication of <i>O. tenuiflorum</i>. A species-specific amplicon (279 bp) generated through an inter-simple sequence repeat marker (UBC 835) in all individuals of <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> was cloned, sequenced, and a primer pair was developed (designated as CIM-OT-835F/CIM-OT-835R). The newly developed sequence characterized amplified region marker was validated through PCR amplification in all available seven species of <i>Ocimum</i>, and its specificity for <i>O. tenuiflorum</i> was confirmed with the consistent generation of an amplicon of 177 bp. The developed marker can be used for accurate and rapid identification of the species for certification purposes and will be useful in quality control of medicinal preparations containing this important medicinal species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Systematics, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Systematics, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Rodrigues", "ForeName": "Vereena", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Systematics, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Systematics, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Baskaran", "ForeName": "Kuppusamy", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Ashutosh K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Shasany", "ForeName": "Ajit K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Systematics, CSIR - Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Research Centre, Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Sundaresan", "ForeName": "Velusamy", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Typing"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum sanctum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28738440", "10.1055/s-0043-116853"]}}]}
