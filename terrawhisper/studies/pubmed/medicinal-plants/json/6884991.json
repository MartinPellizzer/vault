Affinity chromatography on desialylated human IgM coupled to AH-Sepharose was also performed, but the amount bound was very low. The lectin has a molecular mass of about 44000 Da, as determined by ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. Dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis showed one band corresponding to a molecular mass of 26000 Da. N-Terminal amino acid sequence analyses indicate only one type of chain, suggesting that the lectin is probably dimeric. The amino acid composition is given. Papainized human erythrocytes of the different ABO groups were agglutinated equally well by the Cicer lectin, whereas untreated cells reacted weakly and only in the presence of bovine serum albumin. Simple sugars did not inhibit the agglutination, but some glycoproteins did inhibit. The lectin is probably nonmitogenic against human lymphocytes. Antigenic analyses in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed only a weak cross-reaction between Cicer and the lectins in the Vicieae tribe. Thus, our physicochemical and antigenic studies of the Cicer lectin support the botanical reasons recently given for removing the genus Cicer from the Vicieae tribe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kolberg", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michaelsen", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sletten", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985060R", "ISSNLinking": "0018-4888"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultracentrifugation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6884991", "10.1515/bchm2.1983.364.1.655"]}}]}
