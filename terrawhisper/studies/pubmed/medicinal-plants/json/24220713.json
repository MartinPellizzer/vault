Cross sections of the shoot initiation area were observed microscopically and adventitious shoots were studied under the scanning electron microscope. Shoots were directly formed on the epidermis of internodal segments in vitro without callusing, but not on that of nodal segments with axillary buds. The use of media containing 0.01 - 0.1 mg/l 6-benzyladenine or 0.1 mg /l kinetin and culture under 16 h light increased the number of shoots per segment. The shoots thus obtained were rooted on phytohormone-free Woody Plant or Gamborg B5 solid medium, and were then transferred to soil. When potted, these grew well in a greenhouse. The emetic alkaloid content of adventitious shoots and regenerated plants was determined by HPLC. In vitro shoots cultured in Woody Plant liquid medium supplemented with 0.01 - 0.1 mg/l 6-benzyladenine contained 0.04 - 0.07 % dry wt. emetine and 0.4 - 0.5 % dry wt. cephaeline. One-year old regenerated plants cultivated in a greenhouse demonstrated the same alkaloid content (roots contained 0.82 % dry wt. emetine and 2.16 % dry wt. cephaeline) as the parental plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsukuba Medicinal Plant Research Station, National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, 1 Hachimandai, Tsukuba, 305, Ibaraki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshimatsu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shimomura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Planta Med. 1987 Aug;53(4):359-63", "ArticleIdList": ["17269043"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1988 Jun;7(4):288-91", "ArticleIdList": ["24241769"]}, {"Citation": "Exp Cell Res. 1968 Apr;50(1):151-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5650857"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "9", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24220713", "10.1007/BF00232333"]}}]}
