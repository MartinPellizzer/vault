(C. halicacabum) is one of the well-known leafy green vegetables in India. It is an herbaceous climber from the Sapindaceae family which is found in almost every Continent and Oceania. In the traditional Indian medicine systems, this plant is used for the treatment of rheumatism, abdominal pain, orchitis, dropsy, lumbago, skin diseases, cough, nervous disorders, and hyperthermia.", "This review presents the current information about ethnomedical uses and progress on geographical distribution, pharmacological activities, phytochemistry, micropropagation, and toxicity of C. halicacabum. Also, critically summarizes the relationship between the reported pharmacological activities and the traditional usages along with the future perspectives for research on this medicinal plant.", "The data on C. halicacabum were collected using multiple internet sources such as Google Scholar, Science Direct, Taylor & Francis, PubMed, Web of Science, Springer Link, Wiley online, and plant databases.", "Chemical characterization using LC-MS/MS, HPLC, and NMR exposed the presence of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, luteolin-7-o-glucuronide, apigenin-7-o-glucuronide, and chrysoeriol in different parts of C. halicacabum. Based on the outcomes of this review, the main bioactive compounds found in C. halicacabum include phenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, flavonoid glycosides, and flavonoid glucuronides. Besides the above-mentioned constituents, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, linolenic acid, eicosenoic acid, and arachidic acid are the compounds that constitute the fatty acid profile of C. halicacabum seeds. Specifically, Cardiospermin, a bioactive compound isolated from the root extract of C. halicacabum has been recognized for its anxiolytic activity. Moreover, C. halicacabum showed a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic, anti-diabetic, anxiolytic activity, antiulcer, apoptotic activity, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-diarrheal, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective properties. However, the bioactive compounds responsible for most of the above therapeutic properties have not been elucidated till now.", "Phytochemicals from C. halicacabum showed noticeable pharmacological effects against plethora of health disorders. Some of the traditional applications were supported by modern scientific studies, however, more pharmacological evaluations should be conducted to validate other traditional uses of C. halicacabum. Despite C. halicacabum's vast pharmacological activity, additional human clinical trials are needed to determine the potent and safe dosages for the treatment of various health abnormalities. Besides, bioassay-guided isolation of active constituents, pharmacokinetic evaluations and identification of their mode of action are recommended for future investigations on C. halicacabum to unveil its therapeutic drug leads. Overall, this review suggests that C. halicacabum could be a new source of functional foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
