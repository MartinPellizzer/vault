Flowers, leaves, and berries of the plant were extracted in different solvents and tested for their antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method on selected organisms like methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (E. coli).", "The ether extract of flower was found to be highly effective against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). The alcohol extract of these leaves also demonstrated strong activity against gram positive and negative bacteria. The aqueous extract from the berry strongly inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus whereas, it exhibited a very small zone of inhibition against B. subtilis. Multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa was found completely resistant to aqueous extract. The acetone extract of the berry showed good activity against P. aeruginosa.", "The present study reports the antibacterial activity of Elaeagnus umbellata. Most of the extracts displayed broad-spectrum activity, since gram positive bacteria including S. aureus, B. subtilis and gram-negative bacteria including E. coli and P. aeruginosa were inhibited. These preliminary findings may provide the basis for traditional use of this plant in the treatment of infectious diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Breeding and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Azad Jammuand Kashmir, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan.mubashersabir@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sabir", "ForeName": "Mubasher S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Dilnawaz S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Imtiaz M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tahir", "ForeName": "Kaleem M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Saudi Arabia", "MedlineTA": "Saudi Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "7909441", "ISSNLinking": "0379-5284"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Elaeagnaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17268691", "20051230'"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
