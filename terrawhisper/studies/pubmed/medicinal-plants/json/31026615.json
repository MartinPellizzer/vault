Root canals of teeth were prepared with the crown-down technique and contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis after sterilization, and incubated for one week. To investigate the effect of disinfection, 60 specimens were randomly selected for three disinfection groups: He and He/O<sub>2</sub> plasma (n\u2009=\u200920) in 5-s groups (control, 2, 4, 6 and 8\u2009min treatments) and PDT (n\u2009=\u200920) in 2-s groups (control and PDT treatment). Next, for comparison, 40 remaining teeth were divided into four groups: control, 8\u2009min He plasma, 8\u2009min He/O<sub>2,</sub> and PDT. Results of antibacterial action were reported by CFU/mL analysis and the structural changes of biofilm were evaluated by SEM.", "All groups showed a significant reduction of bacteria after treatment, and He/O<sub>2</sub> plasma was more effective against E. faecalis, followed by PDT and He plasma respectively, further confirmed by SEM.", "He/O<sub>2</sub> plasma is a strong sterilization method against E. faecalis biofilm and can, therefore, be an effective therapy in endodontics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
