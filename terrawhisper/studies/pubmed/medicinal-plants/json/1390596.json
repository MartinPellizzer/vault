The faecal true protein digestibility of both pea varieties was about 97. The ileal true protein digestibility was between 93 and 95, indicating that the pea protein is almost completely enzymically digested in the small intestine. The faecal apparent protein digestibility was 85 for both varieties while at the ileal level it was 79 and 74 respectively. The lower ileal apparent protein digestibility of peas can be attributed completely to the excretion of endogenous protein. The ileal apparent protein digestibility of toasted common beans was about zero (-4); the ileal true protein digestibility was about 66. This indicates that the protein of the common bean, although toasted, was highly resistant to enzymic digestion. It was calculated that per kg ingested bean protein, 340 g undigested bean protein and 700 g endogenous protein passed the terminal ileum. The results of the present study explain why in previous experiments a strongly reduced weight gain and even weight loss was observed in piglets fed on raw and toasted common beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TNO-Institute of Animal Nutrition and Physiology (TNO-Dept ILOB), Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Huisman", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heinz", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van der Poel", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Leeuwen", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Souffrant", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Verstegen", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1390596", "10.1079/bjn19920070", "S0007114592000710"]}}]}
