Yukmijihwang-tang (YJT) is a multi-herbal medicinal formula that has been used in traditional Asian medicine to treat male reproductive problems. In this study, we investigated the effects of YJT on CP-induced reproductive toxicities in rat testes. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: vehicle-treated (control), CP-treated and CP+YJT-treated groups. CP was administered for the first 7 days (20 mg/kg/day, p.o.), and YJT was administered for 56 days consecutively (1.0 g/kg/day, p.o.). The CP-treated group showed significant decreases in the weight of the testes, epididymal sperm count and sperm motility compared to the control group, while the CP+YJT-treated group had significant increases for these variables compared to the CP-treated group. The enhancement of lipid peroxidation by CP in the rat testes was reduced by YJT treatment. CP diminished the expression of cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM), a transcription factor that is highly expressed in male germ cells and is crucial to post-meiotic germ cell differentiation. YJT restored CREM at both the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that YJT has a protective effect against CP-induced reproductive toxicities by inhibiting the increases in lipid peroxidation and enhancing CREM expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Prescriptionology, College of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegi-Dong, Dongdaemun-Gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Myung Sook", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Mun Seog", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Wansu", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Do Rim", "Initials": "DR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Hyunsu", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huh", "ForeName": "Youngbuhm", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Seong Kyu", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8803591", "ISSNLinking": "0890-6238"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Crem protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "135844-64-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclic AMP Response Element Modulator"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17624719", "10.1016/j.reprotox.2007.05.007", "S0890-6238(07)00185-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
