Although foliar interception and uptake of N deposition can provide an important alternative N supply to forest ecosystems, the mechanisms regulating foliar N uptake from wet deposition are not fully understood. Here, we selected 19 woody species with a wide range of plant traits from different functional groups and conducted a <sup>15</sup>N isotope labelling experiment through brushing <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> solution on canopy leaves. Our findings demonstrate that leaves can directly absorb N from wet deposition within a few hours. The average leaf <sup>15</sup>N recoveries were 10% and 28% under <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub> <sup>+</sup> and <sup>15</sup>NO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> treatments across species, respectively, while twig N recoveries were only 1%-7% of leaf N recoveries. Differences in foliar N uptake efficiency among species were closely associated with leaf traits but were little influenced by meteorological conditions or soil nutrient status. Specifically, plants with higher leaf N concentration, larger specific leaf area and lower wax concentration exhibited higher leaf N recovery. Our results indicated that tree canopies could directly absorb N from atmospheric deposition. We highlight the critical role of leaf traits in determining canopy foliar N uptake, which may consequently influence plant competition under elevated N deposition."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9
