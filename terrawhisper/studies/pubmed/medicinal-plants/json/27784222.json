The world human population is increasingly facing different types of health issues. For instance, emerging wide array of the drug-resistant pathogens is a health concern. Research on bioactive agents and other natural products of microbes is essential to combat antimicrobial resistance. It is necessary to find new potential antibiotics to address this problem. The use of therapeutic plants in traditional medicine is well known. The medicinal plants contain endophytes which are repositories of bioactive compounds. The natural therapeutic agents produced by endophytes do have several potential applications in the field of pharmaceutical industry. Ecomycins, Pseudomycins, Munumbicins and Xiamycins are the antibacterial, antimycotic and antiplasmodial endophytic derived bioactive agents. Among these, some are having significant antiviral properties and inhibitory activity against plant and human bacterial pathogens. Therefore, to deal with emerging drug-resistant pathogens endophytic peptides could serve as a potential source of novel antibiotics. This review focuses on the peptides derived from plant endophytes, their biological and pharmaceutical applications, and their mechanisms of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Narayana", "ForeName": "Keerthi Kumari Chikkode", "Initials": "KKC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aswathanarayan", "ForeName": "Jamuna Bai", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Studies in Microbiology, University of Mysore, Mysore - 570006, India."}], "LastName": "Vittal", "ForeName": "Ravishankar Rai", "Initials": "RR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Protein Pept Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100960529", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2037"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27784222", "10.2174/1389203717666161025112121", "CPPS-EPUB-79223"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
