The purpose of present manuscript is to provide recent advancement and enhance knowledge of the disease.", "The literature search on etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment was carried out using the online database of Scifinder, Medline, Pubmed and GoogleScholar, Scopus etc. Result: Although the cause of ADEM remains unclear, it is believed to be caused by the inflammation in those with genetic sensitivity to an environmental stimulation. When people have altered levels of awareness or multifocal neurological abnormalities, ADEM is a possibility as a diagnosis. The diagnosis of ADEM is dependent on a combination of clinical, radiologic symptoms and the exclusion of illnesses that mimic ADEM; there is no one test that can establish the diagnosis. The inflammation in a child's brain and spinal cord is treated with medication. Prednisone will occasionally be given to youngsters for a brief amount of time.", "Most children with ADEM improve with high doses of methylprednisolone.
