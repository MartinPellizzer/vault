Chemical and biological methods were used for nutritional determinations in growing rats. The digestive utilization of calcium from raw chickpea was adequate for growing rats; however, processing resulted in a slight decrease. The metabolic utilization of chickpea calcium was low because of the low rates of net absorption. This was reflected in the decreased calcium levels in longissimus dorsi muscle in the absence of mobilization of calcium from the femur. Soaking in acid solution followed by cooking decreased phytic acid content, suggesting that processing made part of the phytic acid phosphorus available. The absorbed phosphorus was greater than the nonphytic phosphorus supplied by the diet. The digestive utilization of phosphorus was similar in processed and raw chickpeas, despite the loss of soluble anion as a result of processing. These results may indicate the contribution of phosphorus in the form of inositol hexaphosphate-phosphorus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Pharmacy, and Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology, University of Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.
