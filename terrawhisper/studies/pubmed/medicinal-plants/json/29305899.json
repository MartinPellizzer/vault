A variety of medicinal plants, particularly those belonging to the genus Ficus (Moraceae), and their active compounds have been used to treat diabetes and related chronic disorders since ancient times.", "The aim of this review is to provide information regarding traditional and scientific knowledge of Ficus species with antidiabetic activity to researchers.", "A literature search was conducted to obtain information about the antidiabetic properties of Ficus from the electronic databases. Common and scientific names of various Ficus species were used as keywords for the search, along with the terms antidiabetic, hypoglycemic and diabetes.", "Among the assorted species of Ficus that were included in our search, F. benghalensis, F. carica, F. glomerata, F. glumosa, F. racemosa, and F. religiosa exhibited remarkable antidiabetic properties with various mechanisms of action. Moreover, Ficus species are versatile sources of bioactive metabolites such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, tannins, alkaloids, glycosides, coumarins, triterpenoids, sterols and vitamin E. These extracts and isolated compounds significantly have enhanced insulin secretion and subsequently reduced blood glucose level in various in vivo studies.", "This review summarizes the antidiabetic potentials of the genus Ficus, including pharmacological studies with mechanisms of action as well as ethnobotanical uses. This review can help inform future scientific research towards the development of novel antidiabetic drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
