Moreover, these cultures can be applied for the production of relevant metabolites with medicinal potential, thus contributing to nutrition and healthcare. Importantly, plant micropropagation has enabled agricultural expansion and tissue culture has emerged as a promising production alternative for several plants and their metabolites in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Plant tissue cultures present several advantages over conventional propagation techniques as they are season independent, enabling a continuous supply of the plants/compounds of interest, with the guarantee of high phytosanitary quality. In addition, genetic uniformity is generally maintained, thus reducing chemical variability that can compromise safety and efficacy. Nevertheless, despite their undeniable potential, with many researchers focusing on new strategies to improve production yield in cell cultures, such as with the use of elicitors or resorting to metabolomics engineering, an effective and lucrative large-scale production has yet to be obtained. Indeed, only a few compounds with market value are produced in this regard and several limitations such as contaminations, low culture yield and production costs still need to be overcome in order to take advantage of the full potential of these techniques."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024.
