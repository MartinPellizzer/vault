In vivo circulation pass perfusion model combined with ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS/MS) method was used to determine the cumulative absorption of each component in different particle size of Gastrodiae Rhizoma powder, and the effect of different particle size, different concentrations, different intestine segments and bile on the intestine absorption of gastrodin and other compositions in Gastrodiae Rhizoma powder was investigated to illuminate the absorption properties and compare the absorption difference of gastrodin and other compositions in Gastrodiae Rhizoma powder in different particle size. The results showed that the absorption of gastrodin in each intestinal segment has no significant difference, pointing out that gastrodin may be passive absorption and the absorption of barrison glycosides may be active absorption; the absorption of gastrodin in ultrafine powder was better than that of common powder and superfine powder of Gastrodiae Rhizoma; the absorption of these barrison glycosides was good in ultrafine powder of Gastrodiae Rhizoma under the high concentration. However, an appropriate degree of superfine grinding can promote the absorption of active ingredients of Gastrodiae Rhizoma. This test can provide information for the deep development of Gastrodiae Rhizoma."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory
