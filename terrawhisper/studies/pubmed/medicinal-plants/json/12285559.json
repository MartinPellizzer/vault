These plants, which grow in the valley of Mexico and surrounding areas, have long been used as a vaginal postcoital douche. The genera tested were Aeonium, Crassula, Echeveria, Kalanchoe, Pachyphytum, and Sedum. The plants were harvested in the flowering phase, which varied over the season for species. Aqueous crude extracts were prepared by grinding 260 gm fresh leaves, filtering through gauze, centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes, lyophilizing, and dialyzing against 2 changes of deionized water. The final extracts were reconstituted 1 mg/ml in Keyhani and Storey medium. Motility, viability, and agglutination of washed human sperm were estimated. All 17 species exhibited immobilizing, agglutinating, and sperm killing activity. Aqueous extracts and infusions of several other plants from 5 other families were also tested without effect on sperm. Preliminary work suggests that the active agent is a micromolecule rather than a macromolecular protein."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["074547", "00215430"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ADVANCES IN CONTRACEPTIVE DELIVERY SYSTEMS"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Alkaloids", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Methods", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Family Planning", "Family Planning, Traditional Methods", "Genitalia", "Germ Cells", "Health", "Health Services", "In Vitro", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Medicine", "Organic Chemicals", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--pharmacodynamics", "Research Methodology", "Research Report", "Sperm Immobilizing Agents", "Spermatozoa", "Spermicidal Contraceptive Agents", "Urogenital System", "Vaginal Spermicides"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12285559", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1993", "Month": "05", "Day": "05"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2014", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1012-8689", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "1-2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992"}}, "Title": "Advances in contraceptive delivery systems : CDS", "ISOAbbreviation": "Adv Contracept Deliv Syst"}, "ArticleTitle": "Immobilizing / agglutination effects of crude extract of crassulaceae plants on human sperm: screening study.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "139", "EndPage": "143", "MedlinePgn": "139-43"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taboada", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ortega", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reyes", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Delgado", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Contracept Deliv Syst", "NlmUniqueID": "8602181", "ISSNLinking": "1012-8689"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermatocidal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genitalia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germ Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Immobilizing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatocidal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urogenital System"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12285559"]}}]}
