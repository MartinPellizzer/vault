Both SRHW and SRM extracts (400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly suppressed the increase in glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activities in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-treated mice. These extracts also inhibited CCl4-induced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBA-RS) formation, which indicates increased lipid peroxidation in the liver. A good correlation (r=0.945, p<0.01) was observed between the amount of phenolic compounds in the extracts and their inhibitions of TBA-RS formation. The IC50 values of the extracts on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging were less than 10 microg/ml and the antioxidative activities of six phenolic compounds from the roots of S. reticulata were examined. Mangiferin, (-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin, and (-)-epicatechin-(4beta-->8)-(-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin, which a principal phenolic compounds, showed potent scavenging activity on DPPH radicals and their concentrations required for 50% reduction of 40 microM DPPH radicals were 5.9, 10, and 3.2 microM, respectively. On the other hand, against the CCl4-induced serum GOT and GPT elevations and TBA-RS formation in mice, mangiferin and (-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin showed potent activity at a dose of 100 mg/kg, but (-)-epicatechin-(4beta-->8)-(-)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin did not. These results suggest that the antioxidative activity of the principal phenolic compounds is involved in the hepatoprotective activity of S. reticulata."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Japan. shoyaku@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshikawa", "ForeName": "Masayuki", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ninomiya", "ForeName": "Kiyofumi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimoda", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishida", "ForeName": "Norihisa", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Matsuda", "ForeName": "Hisashi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11824561", "10.1248/bpb.25.72"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
