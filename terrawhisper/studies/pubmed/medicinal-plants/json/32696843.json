Therefore, the present study was designed with the aim to extract the chemical constituents and to evaluate its antioxidant potential. Fresh plant parts were subjected to the extraction of volatile chemical constituents by maceration using n-hexane as the menstruum. The resulting n-hexane fractions were purified and then subjected to GC-MS and FTIR analysis. In-vitro antioxidant abilities were evaluated by, DPPH, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) method against the standard solutions of (Gallic acid, Quercetin) as a positive control. The GC-MS analysis of leaves, stem and inflorescence showed a total of 100, 98 and 48 components out of which 47, 16 and 17 peaks were identified representing the 67.64 %, 73.16 % and 61.93 % of the total oily fractions, respectively. The FTIR spectrum indicated the presence of various functional groups. In-vitro antioxidant results exhibited that leaves showed the highest antioxidant potential by DPPH (3.365 \u00b1 0.002), and the highest total phenolic content by FC method (203.00 \u00b1 0.091). Foliar micromorphological features were found significant in the authentication of C. oppositifolia. Further pharmacognostic studies of this plant are recommended to evaluate its therapeutic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ishtiaq", "ForeName": "Saiqa", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hanif", "ForeName": "Uzma", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Lahore College for Women University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shaheen", "ForeName": "Shabnum", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bahadur", "ForeName": "Saraj", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Liaqat", "ForeName": "Iram", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Awan", "ForeName": "Umer Farooq", "Initials": "UF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Sciences, Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shahid", "ForeName": "Memuna Ghafoor", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Yunnan University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Shuaib", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Biological Sciences, Quaid-I-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zaman", "ForeName": "Wajid", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Meo", "ForeName": "Mehwish", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "An Acad Bras Cienc", "NlmUniqueID": "7503280", "ISSNLinking": "0001-3765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32696843", "10.1590/0001-3765202020190387", "S0001-37652020000300718"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
