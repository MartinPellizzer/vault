The quality of 11 batches of diploid L. japonica and 13 batches of tetraploid L. japonica collected from different regions across China were analyzed. The contents of five active compounds, consisting of chlorogenic acid, rutin, galuteolin, isochlorogenic acid A and quercetin, were further detected in L. japonica.", "The chromatographic fingerprint established by the optimized HPLC method was verified for qualitative analysis of L. japonica. Quantitative analysis showed that the contents of chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid A, and quercetin in tetraploid plants were higher than those in diploid plants, whereas rutin and galuteolin contents in tetraploid plants were lower than those in diploid plants.", "The developed HPLC method is suitable for qualitative analysis of L. japonica. Polyploidy was indicated to influence the chemical properties of L. japonica. Tetraploid L. japonica shows potential for utilization as a medicinal plant with different active components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Crop Genetic Resources, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Danzhou 571737, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Crop Genetic Resources, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Danzhou 571737, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Crop Genetic Resources, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Danzhou 571737, China."}], "LastName": "Pang", "ForeName": "Yuxin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhisheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Crop Genetic Resources, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Danzhou 571737, China."}], "LastName": "Huan", "ForeName": "Hengfu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Tropical Crop Genetic Resources, Chinese Academy of Tropical Agriculture Sciences, Danzhou 571737, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhijian", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Tradit Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8211546", "ISSNLinking": "0255-2922"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetraploidy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32227768", "2993"]}}]}
