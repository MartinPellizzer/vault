The chemical structures of clausenanisines A-F (1-6) were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods. Notably, clausenanisine A (1) was a novel carbazole alkaloid with a unique five-membered cyclic ether, while clausenanisine E (5) is an unusual carbazole alkaloid owning an unprecedented naturally occurring carbon skeleton possessing 14 carbon atoms. The known carbazole alkaloids (7-18) were identified by the comparison of their spectral data with those data reported in the literature. All known carbazole alkaloids 7-18 were isolated from C. anisum-olens for the first time. Moreover, all isolated compounds 1-18 were assessed for their protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities in vitro. Compounds 1-18 exhibited remarkable PTP1B inhibitory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 to 38.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32\u00a0\u03bcM, meanwhile, compounds 1-18 displayed significant \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 to 192.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.78\u00a0\u03bcM. These research results imply that the separation and identification of these carbazole alkaloids showing notable PTP1B and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activities from the fruits of C. anisum-olens can be very significant for discovering and developing new PTP1B inhibitors and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes mellitus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
