Kabuli) seed meal, globulin proteins or buffer-insoluble residue [starch + non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) + lignin] were studied in growing rats. Chickpea meal, defatted soybean meal, chickpea globulins and lactalbumin were each incorporated into diets as the sole source of dietary protein (100 g/kg). In addition, chickpea insoluble residue was included in a control diet in the same proportion found in the chickpea meal. Rats were killed while under halothane anesthesia after 10 d of consuming the diets, and ileal contents were washed out and freeze-dried for digestibility measurements. Weight gains and gain:feed ratios of rats fed chickpea diets for 10 d did not differ from those of rats fed defatted soybean but were significantly lower than those of rats given the control (lactalbumin) diet. However, ileal and fecal N digestibilities and N retention by rats fed the chickpea diet were significantly lower than those obtained with the lactalbumin or soybean diet. The inclusion of both chickpea meal or its globulin proteins in the diet significantly increased the amount of N excreted, primarily as urea, through the urine. However, although ileal N digestibility values for chickpea meal were significantly lower, those for its constituent globulins did not differ from control values. Urea levels in plasma in rats fed diets containing chickpea meal, globulins or soybean meal were significantly higher than in those fed lactalbumin. Furthermore, the concentrations of glycine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and ornithine in the plasma of rats fed chickpea meal, its globulins or defatted soybean were significantly higher, whereas those of threonine, leucine, lysine and tryptophan were significantly lower than lactalbumin-fed controls. The chickpea insoluble residue had no adverse effects on performance or N utilization by rats. We conclude that the low nutritional value of chickpea meal is likely to be due mainly to adverse effects of its globulin proteins on growth and N metabolism rather than to the action of any known antinutritional factor present in the diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Rowett Research Institute, Bucksburn, Aberdeen AB2 9SB, UK."}], "LastName": "Rubio", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dewey", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Annand", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bardocz", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pusztai", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9013-90-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactalbumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9614167", "10.1093/jn/128.6.1042"]}}]}
