Since Song and Yuan Dynasties, &quot; Baizhu&quot; has been respected and classified in the literature. In Ming Dynasty, &quot; Baizhu&quot; was cultivated and differentiated into different quality specifications according to its growth pattern and origin. Maoshan is the genuine production area of &quot; Cangzhu&quot;. The quality of wild &quot; Baizhu&quot; produced in Yuqian city is the best. In modern times,the origins of &quot; Cangzhu&quot; and &quot; Baizhu&quot; were defined according to plant taxonomy. &quot; Zhu&quot; before Song Dynasty was close to Atractylodes lancea, &quot; Baishu&quot; had been respected since the Song Dynasty. So when Song people revised the previous literature,they unified &quot; Zhu&quot; into &quot; Baizhu&quot; and used it for later generations. Its safety and effectiveness have been confirmed,and the wild resources of modern atractylodes are scarce. Therefore,it is suggested that when classical famous prescriptions are developed,the prescription recorded as &quot; Baizhu&quot; does not need to be changed in its origin,that is,A. macrocephala at present or can choose the appropriate basis according to the principle of local righteousness.Textual research shows that the origin of &quot; Cangzhu&quot; in the classical prescription should be A. lancea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs breeding base,National Resource Center for Chinese MateriaMedica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jia-Chen", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs breeding base,National Resource Center for Chinese MateriaMedica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China Academician Workstation of Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330004,China."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Qian-Qian", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs breeding base,National Resource Center for Chinese MateriaMedica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Zhenghzou 450046,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012,China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Academic,Research China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Hong-Jun", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Dao-di Herbs breeding base,National Resource Center for Chinese MateriaMedica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700,China."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Zhi-Lai", "Initials": "ZL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Atractylodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237364", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191010.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
