IBD is based on progressive damage to the inflamed gut tissue. As its pathogenesis remains unknown, recent accumulating data have demonstrated that IBD is a complex and multi-factorial disorder correlated with host luminal factors, which lead to an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling. The growing understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for IBD has suggested a wide range of potential therapeutic targets to treat this condition. Some patients do not have a satisfactory response to current therapeutic medications such as antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, or their response decreases over time. As a result, IBD therapeutics have been changed recently, with several new agents being evaluated. The identification of various inflammatory cascades has led to forming the idea to have novel medications developed. Medications targeting Janus kinases (JAK), leukocyte trafficking Interleukin (IL) 12/23, and Sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) are among these newly developed medications and highlight the role of microbial-host interaction in inflammation as a safe promising strategy. This systematic review aims to summarize different molecular targeting therapeutics, the most potent candidates for IBD treatment in recent studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, United States."}], "LastName": "Alimohammadi", "ForeName": "Niloufar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Biology and Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York, United States."}], "LastName": "Koosha", "ForeName": "Farzad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahre-kord University of Medical Sciences, Shahre-kord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafeian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colitis, Ulcerative"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crohn Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32250220", "10.2174/1381612826666200406081920", "CPD-EPUB-105657"]}}]}
