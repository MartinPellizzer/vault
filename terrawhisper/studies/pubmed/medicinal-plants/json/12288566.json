After one of the village leaders in 1987 asked the Institute for Social Studies and Action (ISSA) to help develop the community, the BVV community outreach project was launched. Project components promote health care and mobilize women to take an active role in their health as well as their family's and the community's. Once the project was implemented, the ISSA facilitated the formation of an association of volunteers to help residents design and carry out community projects. Exposure trips and lectures outside BVV led to the establishment of communal gardens of medicinal plants by the first three groups of volunteers. Three years later, the trained workers continue to maintain the concept of herbal gardening through individual plots. On their own and with the help of friends, books, and seminars, the women volunteers at BVV have discovered and shared knowledge about the curative powers of medicinal plants. Their faith in herbs and other plants is reinforced by the knowledge that some of the ingredients of imported drugs are medicinal plants native to the country. Herbal produce from the garden has therefore become a viable alternative to expensive name brand drugs. Consumers are, however, told by a volunteer registered nurse to seek her input should improvement in health status not be forthcoming following administration of the appropriate herbs. At the ISSA weekly outreach clinic, whenever applicable or appropriate, an herbal remedy is suggested instead of a branded or generic drug. The article explains which herbs are used per affliction."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["098083", "00238417"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: MARHIA"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Community Development", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Social Development", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12288566", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "06", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0117-0163", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "5", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1992", "Season": "Jan-Mar"}}, "Title": "MARHIA", "ISOAbbreviation": "MARHIA"}, "ArticleTitle": "Backyard botica.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "EndPage": "7", "MedlinePgn": "6-7"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choudhury", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Philippines", "MedlineTA": "MARHIA", "NlmUniqueID": "101084744", "ISSNLinking": "0117-0163"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Change"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12288566"]}}]}
