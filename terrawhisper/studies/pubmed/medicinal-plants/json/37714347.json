Polystyrene (PS) MPs and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are typical MPs and PAEs in the environment. However, how dandelion plants respond to the combined contamination of MPs and PAEs remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the individual and combined effects of PS NPs (10\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) and DBP (50\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) on dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) seedlings. The results showed that compared to control and individual-treated plants, coexposure to PS NPs and DBP significantly affected plant growth, induced oxidative stress, and altered enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels of dandelion. Similarly, photosynthetic attributes and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters were significantly affected by coexposure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that PS particles had accumulated in the root cortex of the dandelion. Metabolic analysis of dandelion showed that single and combined exposures caused the plant's metabolic pathways to be profoundly reprogrammed. As a consequence, the synthesis and energy metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids were affected because galactose metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism pathways were significantly altered. These results provide a new perspective on the phytotoxicity and environmental risk assessment of MPs and PAEs in individual or coexposures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
