At these doses ouabain had no harmful effects with 29% and 45% increase in developed pressure in aerobic hearts. Intracellular Na+ (Nai), 45Ca2+ uptake and recovery of ventricular function were measured. Nai increased from 15 to 64 mumol/g dw with no increase in 45Ca2+ uptake during ischemia. Upon reperfusion with standard buffer, additional gain in Nai at 2 mins (73 mumol/g dw) was followed by a rapid decline (at 10 mins: 48 mumol/g dw). 45Ca2+ uptake increased from 0.8 to 7.5 mumol/g dw after 30 mins reperfusion with decreased recovery of function (45%) and increased LVEDP (29 mmHg). Reperfusion with ouabain accelerated initial rise in Nai (2 mins: 79 and 83 mumol/g dw) and decline of Nai was retarded (10 mins: 65 and 83 mumol/g dw). Consequently, 45Ca2+ uptake and depression of function were augmented (Ca: 10.0, 11.5 mumol/g dw; function: 27%, 18%; LVEDP: 47, 48 mmHg) even when hearts were switched back to standard buffer. Combination of high K+ (20mM) reversed the effect of ouabain. The results suggested increased susceptibility to ouabain was caused by inhibited outward Na+ transport resulting in enhanced Ca2+ influx through Na+/Ca2+ exchange."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatrics, Keio University School of Medicine."}], "LastName": "Tani", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neely", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kokyu To Junkan", "NlmUniqueID": "0413532", "ISSNLinking": "0452-3458"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1708909"]}}]}
