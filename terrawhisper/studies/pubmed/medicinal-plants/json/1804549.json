As in the case of Rb2 reported previously, Rb1 was hydrolyzed to 20(R,S)-ginsenoside Rg3 in 0.1 N HCl. On the other hand, hydroperoxidation of Rb1 occurred in rat stomach; the major hydroperoxide was separated and identified as the 25-hydroperoxy-23-ene derivative of Rb1 (VIII) by 1H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The decomposition modes of 20(S)-ppd saponins (Rb1 and Rb2) differed from that of 20(S)-protopanaxatriol saponin (Rg1) in rat stomach. In rat large intestine, five decomposition products of Rb1 were observed by thin-layer chromatography, and these were identified as gypenoside XVII (G-XVII), ginsenoside Rd (Rd), ginsenoside F2 (F2), compound K (C-K) and VIII. The decomposition modes of Rb1 and Rb2, both 20(S)-ppd saponins, are considered to be different because of the hydrolysis rate in the terminal sugar moiety at the C-20 hydroxyl group in the rat large intestine. Using crude hesperidinase, Rb1 was decomposed to G-XVII, F2 and C-K, and Rb2 was decomposed to 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-20-O-[alpha-L-arabinopyranosyl(1----6)-b eta-D- glucopyranosyl]-20-(S)-ppd, F2 and C-K. Consequently, it appears that hydrolysis by beta-glucosidase, which is present in the rat large intestine, is distinct from that by crude hesperidinase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Karikura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miyase", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanizawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taniyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takino", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11021-13-9", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rb2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1804549", "10.1248/cpb.39.2357"]}}]}
