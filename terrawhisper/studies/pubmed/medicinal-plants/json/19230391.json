The result showed the sample plant from Liaoning had higher light compensate point, higher light saturation point, higher maximum Pn value and higher apparent quantum yield than the sample from Jilin, so it can adapt to the changes of the sunlight in a day better. The weak plant from Jilin had lower light compenstate point, higher light saturation point and higher net photosynthetic rate, so it had stronger availability on light. The stronger one was more sensitive to the weak light. The Jilin sample had higher CE and lower CO2 compensate point compared to that from Liaoning, but when the density of CO2 rised to 240 micromol/mol, the Pn of Schisandra chinensis in Liaoning became much higher than that of Jilin. Under the natural CO2 density condition, the plant from Liaoning had higher photosynthesis ability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Postgraduate Faculty, Jilin Agricultural University, Clangchun 130118, China. 110639871@sohy.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qing-Wei", "Initials": "QW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Quan", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yu-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Chun-Fen", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chun-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoperiod"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Schisandra"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19230391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
