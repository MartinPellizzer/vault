In this study, a total of 270 crucian carp (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0g) were randomly distributed in 9 aquaria (55\u00a0cm\u00a0l\u00a0\u00d7\u00a040\u00a0cm w\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0cm\u00a0h) and divided into three feeding groups including 0 (Control), 50\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> (Diet A) and 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> (Diet B) of salidroside. The expression of immune-related genes (IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, MYD88, CXCL-8, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-11) in the kidney had a significant increase when the crucian carp fed with Diet B for 4 weeks (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Meanwhile, the expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, and CXCL-8 in the spleen was significantly up-regulated when the fish fed with Diet B (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Higher serum alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and complement C3 content were found in the fish which fed with salidroside-supplemented diet. Our results also proved that fish fed with salidroside-supplemented diet for four weeks, especially at a concentration of 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> diet, improved the protection of crucian carp against A. hydrophila. The amount of A. hydrophila in the kidney and spleen was significantly decreased in salidroside-supplemented diet groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that the addition of salidroside for four weeks can improve the immune response of crucian carp and increase the protection against the pathogen, especially at the concentration of 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> diet. The protective effect of the salidroside to the crucian carp could be used as alternatives to antibiotics for controlling fish diseases in aquaculture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
