Sequence analysis of RNA 1 demonstrated five predominant open reading frames (ORFs). The extreme 5' ORF encodes a 34K product of unknown function. The second ORF encodes an 84K product which overlaps 90% of ORF 1 (in a unique reading frame) and is expressed by internal initiation beginning at the second start codon from the 5' terminus. This protein contains a protease-like motif characteristic of serine- and cysteine-based proteases, suggesting involvement in post-translational processing of viral translation products. The third ORF is characterized by a number of RNA polymerase motifs and a helicase-like motif typical of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. It overlaps (out of frame) the ORF 2 product and is proposed to be expressed by a frameshift fusion of the ORF 2 and ORF 3 products. The fourth ORF encodes the viral coat protein, and is immediately followed in frame by a 33K ORF thought to represent the aphid transmission subunit of the PEMV virion. Northern blot analysis of polysome-associated RNA suggests that both products are expressed from an 1800 nucleotide subgenomic mRNA, with the 33K product expressed as a read-through fusion with the coat protein monomer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706."}], "LastName": "Demler", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Zoeten", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Structural Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aphids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Introns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Structural Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1875194", "10.1099/0022-1317-72-8-1819"]}}]}
