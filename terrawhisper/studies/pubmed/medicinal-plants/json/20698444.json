Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode, is used as a model for evaluating anthelmintic activity of a variety of test substances. Extracts of several medicinal plants are useful in vitro and in vivo against nematode development. Extracts of Curtisia dentata, a South African medicinal plant, and compounds isolated from leaves of this plant were investigated for anthelmintic activity against T. colubriformis, H. contortus and C. elegans. The acetone and dichloromethane extracts were active against all nematodes at concentrations as low as 160 microg/ml. Betulinic acid and lupeol were active against the parasitic nematodes only at the high concentrations of 1000 and 200 microg/ml, respectively. All compounds were effective against C. elegans with active concentrations as low as 8 microg/ml. Betulinic acid was less active than lupeol and ursolic acid against C. elegans. The acetone and dichloromethane extracts were also active against C. elegans with a concentration of 0.31 mg/ml resulting in almost 80% inhibition of larval motility. The use of free-living nematodes may provide information on the activity of potential anthelmintics against parasitic nematodes. Extracts of various medicinal plant species may provide solutions to ill-health of small ruminants caused by parasitic nematodes in poor communities of southern Africa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Paraclinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Private Bag X04, Onderstepoort, 0110 South Africa. ljshai@ul.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shai", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bizimenyera", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bagla", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGaw", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eloff", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "Onderstepoort J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0401107", "ISSNLinking": "0030-2465"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cornaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Nematoda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasite Egg Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20698444", "10.4102/ojvr.v76i2.49"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
