Comprehensive chemical analyses of chia seeds' fatty acids and proteins have been conducted, revealing their functional properties. Recent studies have confirmed the high \u03c9-3 content of chia seed oil and have hinted at additional functional characteristics.", "This review article aims to provide an overview of the botanical, morphological, and biochemical features of chia plants, seeds, and seed mucilage. Additionally, we discuss the recent developments in genetic and molecular research on chia, including the latest transcriptomic and functional studies that examine the genes responsible for chia fatty acid biosynthesis. In recent years, research on chia seeds has shifted its focus from studying the physicochemical characteristics and chemical composition of seeds to understanding the metabolic pathways and molecular mechanisms that contribute to their nutritional benefits. This has led to a growing interest in various pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and agricultural applications of chia. In this context, we discuss the latest research on chia, as well as the questions that remain unanswered, and identify areas that require further exploration.", "Nutraceutical compounds associated with significant health benefits including \u03c9-3 PUFAs, proteins, and phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity have been measured in high quantities in chia seeds. However, comprehensive investigations through both in vitro experiments and in vivo animal and controlled human trials are expected to provide greater clarity on the medicinal, antimicrobial, and antifungal effects of chia seeds. The recently published genome of chia and gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR, facilitate functional studies deciphering molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis and metabolic pathways in this crop. This necessitates development of stable transformation protocols and creation of a publicly available lipid database, mutant collection, and large-scale transcriptomic datasets for chia."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
