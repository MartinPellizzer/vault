In case of larvicidal activity, Thevetia peruviana was the most potent, followed by Pueraria mirifica, and Butea superba was the least effective. In all cases, the late 3rd instar was more susceptible than the early 4th instar larvae, and the 48-hours exposure yielded more potent larvicidal activity than 24-hours exposure. However, at sublethal dosages, both P. mirifica and B. superba showed some dispersed effects interfering with ecdysis. A variety of toxic effects were observed and recorded in eight categories according to the stage of metamorphosis when death occurred. P. mirifica rendered the main deleterious effects in the pupa-adult period in both instar of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, whereas B. superba showed highest effect in black-pupa period of the late 3rd instar larval stage. The results were reversed for the early 4th instar larvae of both species of mosquito as the main effect appeared in the pupa-adult category. The overall results indicated that T. peruviana did not show any IGR properties; whereas, P. mirifica and B. superba seemed to exhibit the juvenile hormone type activity which resulted in abnormal death at various stages of development. B. superba was more promising than P. mirifica, and Ae. aegypti was about 2 times more susceptible than Cx. quinquefasciatus. In addition, L3 was always more susceptible than L4 with both mosquito species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Insecticide Research Unit, Department of Medical Entomology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. neparichart@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lapcharoen", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apiwathnasorn", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Komalamisra", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dekumyoy", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Palakul", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rongsriyam", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health", "NlmUniqueID": "0266303", "ISSNLinking": "0125-1562"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Aedes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Culex"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Molting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mosquito Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pueraria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pupa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16438204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
