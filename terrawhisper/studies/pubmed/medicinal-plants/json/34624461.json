Our goal in this experiment was to see if Auraptene (AUR) could help rats recover from TBI-induced disability by measuring of oxidative stress parameters.", "Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of six groups: sham, TBI, Vehicle (DMSO), TBI+\u00a0AUR (4\u202fmg/kg), TBI +\u00a0AUR (8\u202fmg/kg), TBI +\u00a0AUR (25\u202fmg/kg). The animals were anesthetized. After that, diffuse TBI was done by Marmarou model in male rats. Then, the brain tissues were harvested. Some of oxidative stress parameters, and TNF\u03b1 levels were evaluated.", "TBI-induced brain damage was significantly inhibited by AUR (25\u202fmg/kg), as evidenced by decreased Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Nitric Oxide (NO) levels, oxidative stress inhibition and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) in the brain.", "This study showed that probably the AUR prevents complications of TBI through decreases in brain edema, modulating oxidative stress, and reductions in the levels of inflammatory cytokines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
