The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective role of ethanolic extract of CE, a medicinal plant locally called \"Al-Arm\" in Yemen, against liver injury induced by dimethoate (DM) intoxication in male guinea pigs.", "Animals were divided randomly into 5 groups and kept at 5 animals per group. The first group was served as a control group and administered with vehicle orally; the group II administered with DM (14 mg kg-1; 1/25 LD50) orally. Animals of group III, IV and V were administered with 100 mg kg-1 of CE extract, 200 mg kg-1 of CE extract and 100 mg kg-1 Liv-52 orally half hour before DM administration, respectively. All the previous administrations were repeated daily for 21 days. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA using SPSS.", "The DM caused a statistically significant increase in the serum level of liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) when compared to control animals, whereas CE and Liv-52 pre-treatment to the DM-intoxicated animals resulted in a significant normalization of the activities of enzymes. Similarly, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) level, while induced significant decreases in the activities of liver catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). In contrast, co-administration of CE and Liv-52 to DM-treated animals restored most of these biochemical parameters to nearly normal levels. Histopathological examination of intoxicated animals showed many tissues alterations such as; vasodilation, hemorrhage, cytoplasmic vacuolization, inflammation and nuclear pyknosis indicating liver damage, while the animals received CE or Liv-52 showed less pathological effects when compared to animals treated with DM alone.", "The biochemical and histological results confirmed the hepatoprotective effect of ethanolic extract of CE against DM-induced hepatotoxicity in male guinea pigs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Awthan", "ForeName": "Yahya Saleh", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salem Bahattab", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54847-94-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Liv 52"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W6U08B045O", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethoate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimethoate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31930853", "10.3923/pjbs.2019.299.308"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
