This is because the infrastructural health setup in the country is inadequate in catering for all the medical needs of the population. This particularly holds true in the rural areas where many rural folk rely on products of herbal origin to offset their healthcare needs. More often than not these products are an elaborate cacophony of several different substances of biological origin and thus need personnel adept in their preparation. Sadly, due to loopholes in legislation and regulation, quacks have a field day in the practice. Moreover, the process of planting, harvesting, preparation and storage of herbs and related products dictates that a significant number of people will ultimately be involved in the whole process. This is likely to set the stage for manipulation and compromise of the safety, quality and efficacy of these products. This state of affairs appears unabated especially in the context of the current legal and regulatory framework governing herbal medicine use and practice in Kenya. Not only are these laws inadequate, they are shrouded in ambiguity, open to interpretation and the authorities mandated to implement them often end up performing duplicate roles. The aim of this review is to critique the legal and regulatory provisions governing herbal medicine use and practice in Kenya. In conclusion, laws and regulations meant to control herbal medicine use and practice in Kenya are wanting. Clear and definitive legislation on herbal medicine use and practice coupled with effective implementation by mandated institutions will go a long way in inspiring confidence to all stakeholders of herbal medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O BOX 29053-00625 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Okumu", "ForeName": "Mitchel Otieno", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, Moi University, P.O BOX 3900-30100 Eldoret, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Ochola", "ForeName": "Francis Okumu", "Initials": "FO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Onyango Allan and Company Advocates, 3Floor, Pioneer House, P.O BOX 50485-00100 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Onyango", "ForeName": "Allan Odhiambo", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O BOX 29053-00625 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Mbaria", "ForeName": "James Mucunu", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Studies, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O BOX 29053-00625 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Gakuya", "ForeName": "Daniel Waweru", "Initials": "DW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O BOX 29053-00625 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Kanja", "ForeName": "Laetitia Wakonyu", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Physiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Nairobi, P.O BOX 29053-00625 Nairobi, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Kiama", "ForeName": "Stephen Gitahi", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Maseno University, P.O BOX Private bag, Maseno, Kenya."}], "LastName": "Onyango", "ForeName": "Mary Atieno", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Uganda", "MedlineTA": "Pan Afr Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "101517926"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["legislation & jurisprudence"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kenya"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Legislation, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Munyaradzi M.
