We conducted transcriptome analysis to explore the resistance mechanism of sweet potato against <i>F. oxysporum</i>. Our findings highlighted the role of scopoletin, a hydroxycoumarin, in enhancing resistance. In vitro experiments confirmed that scopoletin and umbelliferone had inhibitory effects on the <i>F. oxysporum</i> growth. We identified hydroxycoumarin synthase genes <i>IbF6'H2</i> and <i>IbCOSY</i> that are responsible for scopoletin production in sweet potatoes. The co-overexpression of <i>IbF6'H2</i> and <i>IbCOSY</i> in tobacco plants produced the highest scopoletin levels and disease resistance. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of sweet potato defense against Fusarium wilt and identifies valuable genes for breeding wilt-resistant cultivars."]}, "AuthorList":
