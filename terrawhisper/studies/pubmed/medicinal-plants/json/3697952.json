The levels of N-nitrosoguvacoline (NG) in the saliva of chewers of fresh green areca nuts were very high (70.8 ng/ml) as compared to those reported for individuals using the more complex Indian betel quids (0.91 ng/ml or 5.6 ng/ml). None of the other areca nut-related nitrosamines (N-nitrosoguvacine (NGC), 3-(methylnitrosamino)propionitrile (MNPN) and 3-(methylnitrosamino)propionaldehyde (MNPA)) were detected in the saliva of Taiwanese betel quid chewers. The addition of slaked lime to the areca nut enhances the formation of NG during a chewing session. The frequency of MEC did not increase in the oral mucosa of areca nut chewers who do not use slaked lime, but showed a small but significant elevation in individuals using lime-containing quids. The elevation of MEC in Taiwanese, who are at low risk for oral cancer, is relatively small as compared to that found in chewers of Indian betel quids (pan), who show a highly elevated oral cancer risk. The results seem to suggest that NG may play only a minor role, if any, in the etiology of oral cancer among betel quid chewers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "H F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosin", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brunnemann", "ForeName": "K D", "Initials": "KD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3697952", "10.1016/0304-3835(86)90162-x", "0304-3835(86)90162-X"]}}]}
