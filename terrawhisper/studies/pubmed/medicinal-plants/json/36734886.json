People believe that herbal medicines are safe and more cost-effective than other synthetic medicines. Herbal medicines are also used as a promising source of new drug discovery molecules in modern medicines. Coumarins are polyphenols class phytochemical that naturally occurs in higher plants and are used in medicine for the treatment of human disorders and associated secondary complications. Columbianetin is a coumarin class phytochemical found in Angelica archangelica L.", "The aim of the present work is to review the medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of columbianetin and to provide a summary of the medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of columbianetin in medicine. Further scientific progress of columbianetin in the fields of Ethnopharmacology, Phytochemistry and Pharmacology has been analyzed and discussed in the present work. However, possible future research on columbianetin has been also discussed in the present work. Scientific information on columbianetin was collected from PubMed, Elsevier, Google, Google Scholar, and Europe PMC using herbal medicine, columbianetin and coumarin as important keywords. Other published books and journal data have also been included in the present work to know the therapeutic potential of columbianetin in medicine.", "Scientific data analysis of columbianetin signified the biological importance of phytochemicals belonging to the coumarins. Biological effectiveness of coumarins for their antioxidative, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory potential has been discussed in the research fields. Columbianetin has analgesic, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-allergic activities in medicine. However, its biological effectiveness on neuroprotection, keratinocyte damage and platelet aggregation has also been discussed in the present work. Further tissue distribution of columbianetin in different biological tissue has been estimated through different analytical methods and scientific data are also presented in the present work.", "The present work summarized the biological importance and pharmacological activities of columbianetin in medicine. Analytical methods developed for the quantitative and qualitative estimation of columbianetin have also been reviewed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Bioanal Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "9918418288306676", "ISSNLinking": "2949-6810"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36734886", "10.2174/1872312815666230124154630", "DMBL-EPUB-129064"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
