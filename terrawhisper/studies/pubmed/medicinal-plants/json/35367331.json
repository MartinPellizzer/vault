The effects of sulfur-fumigation on the efficacy and safety of medicinal herbs were evaluated by meta-analysis approaches.", "A total of sixteen studies were included in this study. Sulfur-fumigation reduced the efficacies of medicinal herbs with immune activity [thymus index (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.81; P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001); spleen index (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.11; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)], anti-oxidative activity [MDA (SMD\u00a0=\u00a02.60; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04); SOD (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-2.21; P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001)], analgesic activity [heat tolerate time (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-2.51; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001); writhing time (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.36; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006)], anti-platelet aggregation activity (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.84; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and anti-inflammatory activity [ear swelling degree (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.47; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006)]. The reductions might be ascribed to sulfur-fumigation significantly reduced the contents of active ingredients in medicinal herbs, leading to dramatic decrease in the absorption of these ingredients and their metabolites in vivo. Furthermore, sulfur-fumigation induced the toxicities of medicinal herbs, mainly on hepatotoxicity, which might due to fumigation-induced residues of sulfur dioxide and heavy metal, and generations of sulfur-containing derivatives and toxic metabolites. Besides, administrated with sulfur-fumigated medicinal herbs with high sulfur ratio and/or higher dosage showed more significant toxicity.", "Sulfur-fumigation reduced the efficacy and safety of medicinal herbs, indicating sulfur-fumigation might not a feasible approach to process medicinal herbs. However, with obvious limitations, much more rigorous designed-trials are still needed to confirm the conclusion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
