To accurately monitor the residual pesticides, this paper investigated the drug use during the process of P. heterophylla disease prevention in 25 P. he-terophylla planting enterprises or individual households in Guizhou province. It was found that there were 8 common diseases in P. he-terophylla planting, including leaf spot, downy mildew, virus disease, root rot, dropping disease, purple feather disease, white silk disease, and damping-off disease. Twenty-three kinds of pesticides were used in disease control, mainly chemical synthetic pesticides, accounting for 78.3%, followed by biological pesticides and mineral pesticides, accounting for 13.0% and 8.7%, respectively. The disease prevention and control drugs were all low-toxic pesticides, and there were no varieties banned in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia(2020 edition). However, the pesticides used have not been registered on P. heterophylla, and the excessive use of drugs was serious. The present monitoring of pesticide residues in P. heterophylla is mainly based on traditional pesticides such as organochlorine, organophosphorus, and carbamate, which does not effectively cover the production of drugs and had certain safety risks. It is suggested to speed up the research and registration of drug use in the production of P. heterophylla, increase the use of biological pesticides, and further improve the monitoring indicators of pesticide residues in combination with the actual production of drugs, so as to promote the high-quality development of P. heterophylla industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Gui", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650031, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, Chinese Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tongjitang (Guizhou) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
