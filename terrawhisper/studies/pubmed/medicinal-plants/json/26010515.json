A study of fresh herbs was carried out to assess their microbiological safety in relation to Salmonella contamination and levels of Escherichia coli.", "Between January and March 2014, 774 samples of ready-to-eat, fresh, whole-leaf herbs were collected from retail premises in the United Kingdom. Overall, Salmonella was detected in nine samples (1\u00b72%). Of these, five were curry leaves. Other herbs contaminated with Salmonella were basil (two samples), walleria (1) and coriander (1). Escherichia coli was detected in 13% of samples, with 11% containing unsatisfactory levels (\u226510(2) g(-1)).", "Whilst 88% of samples in this study were of an acceptable microbiological quality, the presence of Salmonella and/or elevated E. coli levels in 12% is a cause for concern. Curry leaves, in particular, had significantly higher rates of contamination with both Salmonella and E. coli than other herbs.", "This study highlights the potential public health risk associated with the consumption of certain ready-to-eat fresh herbs, and the need for good hygiene practices and effective decontamination procedures during the growth, harvesting and subsequent handling of these products."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory Porton, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK."}], "LastName": "Willis", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory Porton, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK."}], "LastName": "Sadler-Reeves", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory London, Colindale, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Elviss", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory York, FERA, York, UK."}], "LastName": "Aird", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory Preston, Royal Preston Hospital, Preston, UK."}], "LastName": "Fox", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory Birmingham, Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield, UK."}], "LastName": "Kaye", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal Bacteria Reference Unit, Public Health England, Colindale, London, UK."}], "LastName": "de Pinna", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections Department, Public Health England, Colindale, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Lane", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health England, Food Water and Environmental Microbiology Laboratory London, Colindale, London, UK."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Liverpool, Institute of Infection and Global Health, Liverpool, UK."}], "LastName": "McLauchlin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26010515", "10.1111/jam.12855"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
