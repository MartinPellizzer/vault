Therefore, the remission of cognitive symptom has been considered as one of the main objectives in the treatment of MDD. Herbal antidepressants have been used to treat MDD, and there has been great advances in the understanding of the ability of these herbs to improve cognitive deficit linked to brain injury and various diseases including depression, Alzheimer disease, diabetes and age-related disorders. This systematic review summarizes the evidence from preclinical studies and clinical trials of herbal antidepressants with positive effects on cognitive deficit. The potential mechanisms by which herbal antidepressants prevent cognitive deficit are also reviewed. This review will facilitate further research and applications.", "We conducted an open-ended, English restricted search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Web of Science and Scopus for all available articles published or online before 31 December 2019, using terms pertaining to medical herb/phytomedicine/phytochemical/Chinese medicine and depression/major depressive disorder/antidepressant and/or cognitive impairment/cognitive deficit/cognitive dysfunction.", "7 prescriptions, more than 30 individual herbs and 50 phytochemicals from China, Japan, Korea and India with positive effects on the depressive state and cognitive deficit are reviewed herein. The evidence from preclinical studies and clinical trials proves that these herbal antidepressants exhibit positive effects on one or more aspects of cognitive defect including spatial, episodic, aversive, and short- and long-term memory. The action mode of the improvement of cognitive deficit by these herbal antidepressants is mediated mainly through two pathways. One pathway is to promote hippocampal neurogenesis through activating brain derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin-related kinase B signaling. The other pathway is to prevent neuronal apoptosis through the inhibition of neuro-inflammation and neuro-oxidation.", "These herbal antidepressants, having potential therapy for cognitive deficit, may prevent pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, these herbal medicines should provide a treasure trove, which will accelerate the development of new antidepressants that can effectively improve cognitive symptom in MDD. Studies on their molecular mechanisms may provide more potential targets and therapeutic approaches for new drug discovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
