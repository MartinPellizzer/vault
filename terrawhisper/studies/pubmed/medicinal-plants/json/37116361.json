To obtain excellent adsorption performance, creating defective structure in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) can be employed as the method for adjusting its properties. Zirconium(\u2163)-based MOF termed as UiO-66-30% was constructed with 2-aminoterephthalic acid (NH<sub>2</sub>-BDC) and terephthalic acid (H<sub>2</sub>BDC) as building blocks. After calcination and removal of thermal-sensitive ligand (NH<sub>2</sub>-BDC), hierarchically porous UiO-66-30% (HP-UiO-66-30%) with multistage pore structure and good stability was obtained. The unique structure of HP-UiO-66-30% endowed it to achieve instantaneous equilibrium (within 2\u00a0min) when it was used as a dispersed solid phase extraction (d-SPE) adsorbent to extract BUs from environmental samples, greatly reducing the operation time. A wide linear range (0.05-200\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>), good linearity (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.9980), low detection limits (0.01-0.03\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>) and quantification limits (0.05-0.1\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>) were obtained for BUs. In addition, the HP-UiO-66-30% material possessed the good reusability and the adsorption capacity did not change significantly over 16 adsorption-desorption cycles. Finally, the established dispersed solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (d-SPE-HPLC-DAD) method was successfully applied to determination of BUs residues in environmental soil samples. The results demonstrated that HP-UiO-66-30% was an excellent sorbent for extraction BUs from environmental samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
