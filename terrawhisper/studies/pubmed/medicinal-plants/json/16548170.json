The contents of NO, MDA, *OH, and SOD activity were also measured in gastric mucosa.", "TA showed significantly inhibitive effects on gastric damages induced by ig ethanol in a dose dependent manner. The effects of TA (120 mg x kg(-1)) were stronger than that of both cimitidine(70 mg x kg(-1)) and berberine(100 mg x kg(-1)), the quantity of later was equal to TA as calculated with berberine. TA significantly suppressed secretion of gastric acid caused by ethanol without clear influences on gastric juice volume and mucus secretion. TA obviously blunted ethanol-induced elevation of MDA and *OH, as well as decrease of NO level and SOD activity from gastric mucosa.", "It is suggested that the TA is a potent protective agent against ethanol-induced gastric damages. The mechanism of actions may be related with inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid and blunting the increase of MDA and *OH, as well as the decrease of NO level and SOD activity from gastric mucus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Bei", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hua-rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yong-quan", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Qing-song", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Jing-chuan", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Xian-hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Bai-cheng", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jun-qing", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Qi-xin", "Initials": "QX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coptis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16548170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
