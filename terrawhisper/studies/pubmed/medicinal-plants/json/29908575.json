This review focuses on traditional dermatologic herbal remedies, commonly used in Russia, as the rich array of 11 different plant zones has resulted in a great variety of medicinal plants. Herbal remedies warrant deeper investigation and research, especially due to their active substance content, which may interfere with or reinforce the effect of modern medications, something that medical professionals should be aware of when prescribing treatments. Although there are a great number of traditional herbal treatments in Russia, only the most commonly used and known treatments and applications will be described as an introduction to the field, which has had many books of varying quality written about it. The preparation and application of treatments for vitiligo, pyodermas, parasitic and infectious skin diseases, acne, dermatitides, rosacea, hyperpigmentation, rhytides, psoriasis, and hyperhidrosis are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
