In October 2021, a leaf spot disease was observed on I. nil in a field as weed in Jingzhou (N 30\u00b0 21', E 112\u00b0 19'), Hubei Province, China. Symptoms began as small brown blotches, then developed into oval or irregularly shaped brown necrotic lesions. In severe cases, the leaves were completely necrotic and detached. In the surveyed area, the incidence was between 30% - 40%. To isolate the pathogen, twenty-one leaf pieces (5\u00d75 mm) were cut from the lesion edges of seven symptomatic leaves, disinfected with 70% ethanol and 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), rinsed with sterile water five times, then placed on three potato dextrose agar (PDA) modified with 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin, and incubated at 25 \u00b0C in dark for 5 days. The isolates were subcultured by transferring mycelium tips. Sixteen fungal strains were isolated from the tissues, and nine of them showed similar morphological characteristics. After cultured 7 days on PDA at 25 \u00b0C, the nine colonies were initially white, then turned greenish brown to black in the center and had abundant fine villous aerial mycelia up to 61.5 mm in average diameter. To examine its conidial morphology, the fungi were cultured for 7 days on potato carrot agar (PCA) at 22\u00b0C with a light/dark period of 8/16 h. On PCA, conidia were brown or olive-brown, obclavate to obpyriform, with a short beak, one to five transverse and zero to three longitudinal septa. They formed chains of 1 - 8 conidia, with branches. Conidia were 16 - 46 \u00b5m long and 8 - 14 \u00b5m wide (n=50). These morphological features were similar to those described in Alternaria spp. (Simmons 2007). A single isolate \"Q2\" was selected for molecular identification because it was the most aggressive in preliminary leaf pathogenicity assays. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and histone 3 (H3) gene were amplified and sequenced using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and H3-1a/H3-1b (Zheng et al. 2015). BLAST analysis revealed that the sequences (ITS, ON360984; H3, ON375577) were 100% identical to Alternaria alternata (ITS, MK396607; H3, MN840996), respectively. Maximum likelihood analysis based on combined two gene sequences was conducted with an evolutionary model of GTR+I+G under 1000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic tree showed that Q2 and Alternaria alternata 21-5 and BLH-YB-11 located in one clade supported with 99% bootstrap values. The pathogen was identified as A. alternata. To fulfill Koch's postulate, 10 ml conidia (106 spores/ml) of Q2 was sprayed on five healthy seedlings, with sterile distilled water as a control. All leaves were rinsed three times with sterile water before inoculation. All seedlings were placed in sealed plastic bags with air valves, and grown in a greenhouse (25 \u00b1 2 \u02daC, RH 65%). The test was repeated twice. After 10 days, symptoms typical of brown blotches similar to those observed in the field were observed on leaves of inoculated plants, while control remained healthy. A. alternata was re-isolated from the inoculated symptomatic leaves with a frequency of 100% based on morphological and molecular characters, thus Koch's postulate was confirmed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata causing leaf spot on I. nil in China. Our findings extended the host range of the pathogen A. alternata on characteristic plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jingzhou, China; 105381237@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Fan-Song", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jingzhong, China; 996357725@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jingzhou, China; 2624712787@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "JingZhouJingZhou, China, 434020; 2238479220@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Li-Tao", "Initials": "LT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei JingzhouJingzhou, China, 434025; sunzhengxiang9904@126.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhengxiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze UniversityJingzhou, China, 434025."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China; zhouyi@yangtzeu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36256737", "10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1962-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
