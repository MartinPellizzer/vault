In the present study, we identified novel functions of herbal medicines in DCs by screening 99 herbal medicines, most of which are among the 210 Chinese medicines approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, Japan. Ethanol extracts were prepared, and a murine epidermal-derived Langerhans cell line, XS106, was used to screen the 99 extracts by analyzing major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Amomi Semen (amomum seed), Polyporus (polyporus sclerotium), and Plantaginis Semen (plantago seed) potently activated XS106 and were selected for further analysis. The effects of these extracts on bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) generated in vitro were then analyzed using surface phenotype (MHC class II, CD80, and CD86) and interleukin (IL)-12p70 production as indicators. BM-DCs treated with Amomi Semen extract exhibited activated phenotypes and secreted IL-12p70. The activation level was similar to that induced by lipopolysaccharides. Finally, an E.G7-OVA tumor model (E.L4-OVA transfectant) was used to examine the anti-tumor effects of Amomi Semen extract. Vaccination of mice with a subcutaneous injection of BM-DCs treated with Amomi Semen extract and OVA peptide significantly inhibited the growth of tumor cells and prolonged survival time compared to controls. Furthermore, therapeutic effects were observed on established tumors. The inhibition rates for both the prophylactic and therapeutic protocols were comparable to those of lipopolysaccharides. These results indicate that Amomi Semen extract potently activate DCs and is potentially useful for DC vaccination."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatric and Environmental Dermatology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fukui", "ForeName": "Hajime", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mitsui", "ForeName": "Seika", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harima", "ForeName": "Nobue", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nose", "ForeName": "Mitsuhiko", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsujimura", "ForeName": "Kunio", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mizukami", "ForeName": "Hajime", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morita", "ForeName": "Akimichi", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "7703966", "ISSNLinking": "0385-5600"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9006-59-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Ovalbumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amomum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendritic Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovalbumin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18037790", "10.1111/j.1348-0421.2007.tb03998.x", "JST.JSTAGE/mandi/51.1121"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
