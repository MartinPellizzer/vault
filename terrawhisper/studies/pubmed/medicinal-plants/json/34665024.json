Functional heart symptoms, especially chest pain, are prevalent and, according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), are described as \"somatoform autonomous functional disorders of the cardiovascular system.\" The problem lies in the fact that pain does not always have a somatic background, that is, it may be related to crucial underlying heart disease. The population does not know how to differentiate somatic pain from significant ischemic symptoms, and based on the patient's complaints, traditional medicine ends up treating other underlying cardiac diseases. Many unsuccessful unconventional therapies have been proposed in recent years, including herbal medicines that seek to disrupt the disease's pathogenesis. The present review summarizes research carried out in the last 5 years on natural products' heart complaints, including myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, and heart failure. Several herbal medicines may be used as a replacement or complementary treatment strategy. A total of 17 medicinal plants have shown promising results in preclinical studies. However, human clinical trials are scarce; only two have been presented. Generally, the data are bland, and many issues have been raised about herbal therapies' safety, efficacy, and mode of action. Besides, relevant clinical trials, future perspectives, and possible clinical applications are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PPGCF), Chemical-Pharmaceutical Research Nucleus (NIQFAR), University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed (UNIVALI), Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "de Souza", "ForeName": "Priscila", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Biology, Department of Pharmacology, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mariano", "ForeName": "Lu\u00edsa Nath\u00e1lia Bolda", "Initials": "LNB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PPGCF), Chemical-Pharmaceutical Research Nucleus (NIQFAR), University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed (UNIVALI), Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "da Silva", "ForeName": "Rita de C\u00e1ssia M V A F", "Initials": "RCMVAF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cesumar Institute of Science, Technology, and Innovation (ICETI), University Center of Maringa, Maringa, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gasparotto", "ForeName": "Francielli", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pre-Clinical Research of Natural Products, Postgraduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Universidade Paranaense, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Louren\u00e7o", "ForeName": "Emerson Luiz Botelho", "Initials": "ELB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pre-Clinical Research of Natural Products, Postgraduate Program in Animal Science with Emphasis on Bioactive Products, Universidade Paranaense, Umuarama, PR, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Donadel", "ForeName": "Guilherme", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Program in Pharmaceutical Sciences (PPGCF), Chemical-Pharmaceutical Research Nucleus (NIQFAR), University of Vale do Itaja\u00ed (UNIVALI), Itaja\u00ed, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Boeing", "ForeName": "Thaise", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3433-5098"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (LaFaC), Faculty of Health Sciences, Federal University of Grande Dourados, Dourados, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gasparotto Junior", "ForeName": "Arquimedes", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feasibility Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34665024", "10.1089/jmf.2021.0030"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
