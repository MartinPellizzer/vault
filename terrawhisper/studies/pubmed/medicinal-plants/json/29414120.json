People living in the tropical South-Eastern part of Nigeria use the plant in folk medicine for the treatment of malaria, abscesses and as a vermifuge. Although there are a few reports about its in vitro anthelminthic activity against different worm categories, scientific reports regarding its in vivo anthelminthic activity are limited.", "This study was designed with the aim of determining the potential of the plant as an anthelminthic and to verify the claims made by its local users.", "Acute toxicity of the plant extract was determined using Lorke's method. Anthelminthic activity was investigated using adult male albino mice experimentally infected with Heligmosomoides bakeri infective L<sub>3</sub>. Graded ascending doses of the plant extract and Albendazole respectively were orally administered to the mice in the infected groups. Corprological and haematological parameters were recorded within the study period. Twenty-eight (28) days post-infection, all infected mice were humanely sacrificed and the Post-Mortem Adult Worm Burden (WB) was estimated and recorded.", "The results showed that the extract had an LD<sub>50</sub> greater than 5000\u202fmg/kg BW and therefore was not acutely toxic for oral use. It also showed that the plant extract was unable to eliminate the faecal egg output or adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract of infected animals even at the high doses used in the study. This was in contrast to Albendazole which significantly (p < .05) reduced faecal egg counts and worm burdens by 71% and 92% respectively in treated mice. Following infection, there was anaemia in all infected groups seen from results of erythrocytic parameters. Treatment with the plant extract, regardless of the dose, was unable to effectively reverse the effect of parasite infection on erythrocytic parameters. However, treatment with Albendazole positively reversed the anaemia, restoring the mice to pre-infection values by the end of the experiment. The results showed significant (p < .05) increase in WBC counts across all groups following infection with the parasite. Treatment with the plant extract and Albendazole respectively, significantly (p < .05) reduced the WBC counts to near pre-infection values in most treatment groups.", "As a result of the poor anthelminthic effects recorded in the study, it is therefore recommended that Duranta erecta L. fruits be explored for its other useful effects rather than as an anthelminthic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
