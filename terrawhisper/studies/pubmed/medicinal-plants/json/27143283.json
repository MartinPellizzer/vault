The expression of melanogenesis genes, such as tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2 was also assessed.

The melanogenesis inhibitory activity of osthol was achieved not by direct inhibition of tyrosinase activity but by inhibiting melanogenic enzyme expressions, such as tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2. The optimal condition was obtained as a sample/solvent ratio, 1500\u2009mg/10 ml; an extraction time 30.3 min; and a methanol concentration of 97.7%.
