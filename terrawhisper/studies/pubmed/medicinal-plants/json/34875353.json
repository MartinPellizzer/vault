AE showed a wide array of pharmacological activities including anticancer, antifungal, laxative, antiviral, and antibacterial effects. However, increasing number of published studies have shown that AE may have some hepatotoxicity effects but the mechanism is not fully understood. Studies have shown that the liver injury induced by some free hydroxyanthraquinone compounds is associated with the inhibition of some metabolic enzymes. In this study, the CYP3A4 and CYP3A1 were found to be the main metabolic enzymes of AE in human and rat liver microsomes respectively. And AE was metabolized by liver microsomes to produce hydroxyl metabolites and rhein. When CYP3A4 was knocked down in L02 and HepaRG cells, the cytotoxicity of AE was increased significantly. Furthermore, AE increased the rates of apoptosis of L02 and HepaRG cells, accompanied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss and reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction. The mRNA expression of heme oxygenase-1 in L02 and HepaRG cells increased significantly in the high-dose of AE (40\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) group, and the mRNA expression of quinone oxidoreductase-1 was activated by AE in all concentrations. Taken together, the inhibition of CYP3A4 enhances the hepatocyte injury of AE. AE can induce mitochondrial injury and the imbalance of oxidative stress of hepatocytes, which results in hepatocyte apoptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
