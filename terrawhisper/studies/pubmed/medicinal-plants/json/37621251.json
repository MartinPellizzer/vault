Therefore, it is considered an ideal target for tumor intervention. However, the allosteric mechanisms of SHP2 binding PD-1 intracellular ITIM/ITSM phosphopeptides remain unclear, which greatly hinders the development of novel structure-based anticancer allosteric inhibitors. In this work, the open and closed structural models of SHP2 are first constructed based on this knowledge; next their motion modes are investigated <i>via</i> elastic network models such as the Gaussian network model (GNM), anisotropic network model (ANM) and adaptive anisotropic network model (aANM); and finally, a possible allosteric signaling pathway is proposed using a neural relational inference molecular dynamics (NRI-MD) simulation embedded with an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. In GNM and ANM, the N-SH2, C-SH2 and PTP domains all exhibit distinct dynamics partitions, and the N-SH2/C-SH2 regions show a rigid rotation relative to PTP. According to a series of intermediate snapshots given by aANM, N-SH2 is first identified with pY223 specifically, inducing a D'E-loop to change from \u03b2-sheets to random coils, and then, C-SH2 serves as a fulcrum to drive N-SH2 to rotate 110\u00b0 completely away from the original active sites of PTP. Finally, a possible allosteric signaling-transfer path for SHP2, namely R220-R138-T108-R32, is proposed based on NRI-MD sampling. This work provides a possible allosteric mechanism of SHP2, which is helpful for the following design of novel allosteric inhibitors and is expected to be used in clinical synergies with PD-1 monoclonal antibody."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. ouyangww73@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Breast Disease Center, Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610000, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. ouyangww73@163.com."}], "LastName": "Geng", "ForeName": "Yichao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. ouyangww73@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qingsong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. ouyangww73@163.com."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Daxian", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8943-4742"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0008-1754-3040"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Thoracic Oncology, Affiliated Cancer Hospital, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, China. ouyangww73@163.com."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Weiwei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phys Chem Chem Phys", "NlmUniqueID": "100888160", "ISSNLinking": "1463-9076"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.48", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allosteric Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artificial Intelligence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37621251", "10.1039/d3cp02795c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
