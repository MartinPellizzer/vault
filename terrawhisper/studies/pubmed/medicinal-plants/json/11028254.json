This project was conducted to evaluate the hemostatic effects of notoginseng using a hemorrhagic rat model. Rats (n = 40) were divided into four groups, and their tails were transected 5 mm from the tip. Group 1 received no treatment (control), while the other groups received external powder applied to the wound. Group 2 received placebo (flour), group 3 received ground notoginseng, and group 4 received a saponin extract of notoginseng. The total bleeding time was determined and compared between groups. The notoginseng group had lower bleeding times (9.60 +/- 1.50 min) than the control group (19.23 +/- 4.09 min, p < 0.001) or the placebo group (15.18 +/- 2.24 min, p < 0.001). Likewise, the saponin extract group had significantly lower bleeding times (11.70 +/- 2.53 min) than the control and placebo groups (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). No differences were found between the notoginseng and the saponin extract groups (p = 0.35). Notoginseng and a saponin extract from notoginseng provide hemostatic effects when applied externally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hartford Hospital, Department of Pharmacy, Connecticut, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "White", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chow", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0366372", "ISSNLinking": "0091-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemostatics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bleeding Time"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hemostatics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11028254"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
