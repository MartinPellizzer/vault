Tribulus terrestris L. (TT) belongs to the Zygophyllaceae family and it is used in folk medicine to vitalize and also improve both physical performance and sexual function in men in addition to the protective effect of the gross saponins of TT against ischemic stroke and its clinical anti-inflammatory property.", "This study aimed to investigate the effects of methanol extract of T. terrestris on nicotine hydrogen tartrate and lead-induced degeneration of sperm quality in male rats and to identify the volatile bioactive non-polar compounds thought to be responsible for its activity using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).", "The effect of T. terrestris on nicotine hydrogen tartrate and lead-induced infertility was evaluated in male rats. Fifty-four mature male albino rats weighing 220-250\u00a0g body weight were used. The rats were randomly divided into 9 equal groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Infertility was induced by administering nicotine hydrogen tartrate (0.50\u00a0mg/kg) through peritoneal injection (i.p.) or lead acetate (1.5\u00a0g/L) orally with drinking water for sixty days. Two doses (50 and 100\u00a0mg/kg body weight of the animal) of T. terrestris were also used. At the end of the experimental period, the rats were anesthetized and sacrificed. Blood samples were collected. Hormonal analyses were carried out on the serum. The testicle, epididymis, and accessory sex organs (seminal vesical and prostates) were removed for histopathological analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the methanol extract was also carried out to identify major volatile compounds in T. terrestris methanol extract.", "Nicotine and lead toxicity caused a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decrease in the number of sperm, motility, and an increase in the sperm abnormalities such as the reduction in weight and size of sexual organs (testis, epididymis, and accessory sex glands), reduction of diameter and length of seminiferous tubules. The administration of T. terrestris methanol extract, however, improved the semen quantity and quality, sexual organ weights, and fertility of male rats and, thus, ameliorated the adverse effects of nicotine and lead. Ten major compounds were found from the GC-MS analysis of the extract of T. terrestris methanol extract.", "Findings showed that T. terrestris plant methanolic extracts ameliorated nicotine hydrogen tartrate and lead-induced degeneration of sperm quality in male rats. The GC-MS analysis of the T. terrestris plant methanolic extracts revealed the presence of several important bioactive compounds which were thought to be responsible for the ameliorative effect. Further isolation and evaluation of the individual components would provide relevant lead to finding new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
