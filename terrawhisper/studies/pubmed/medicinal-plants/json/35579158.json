Employing combination therapies using novel drug delivery systems and also natural antimicrobial substances is a promising strategy in this field. Nanoparticles (NPs)-based materials have become well appreciated in recent times due to their function as antimicrobial agents or carriers for promoting the bioavailability and effectiveness of antibiotics. Flavonoids belong to the promising groups of bioactive compounds abundantly found in fruits, vegetables, spices, and medicinal plants with strong antimicrobial features. Flavonoids and NPs have the potential to work as alternatives to the conventional antimicrobial agents, when used alone as well as in combination. Different classes of flavonoid NPs may be particularly advantageous in treating microbial infections. The most important antimicrobial mechanisms of flavonoid NPs include oxidative stress induction, non-oxidative mechanisms, and metal ion release. However, the efficacy of flavonoid NPs against pathogens and drug-resistant pathogens changes according to their physicochemical characteristics as well as the particular structure of microbial cell wall and enzymatic composition. In this review, we provide an outlook on the antimicrobial mechanism of flavonoid-based NPs and the crucial factors involved in it."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental and Periodontal Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salatin", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bazmani", "ForeName": "Ahad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental and Periodontal Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahi", "ForeName": "Shahriar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naghili", "ForeName": "Behrooz", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Memar", "ForeName": "Mohammad Yousef", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental and Periodontal Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dizaj", "ForeName": "Solmaz Maleki", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35579158", "10.2174/1381612828666220509151407", "CPD-EPUB-123237"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
