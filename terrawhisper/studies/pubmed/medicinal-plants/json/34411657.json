It is regarded as the seventh most deadly weed in the world: harmful to both humans and livestock. It is widely known as Congress Grass or Feverfew. Despite its pitfalls, P. hysterophorus bestows medicinal effects. Although prolific in nature and difficult to control, many novel applications of this controversial herb have been discovered as an approach to manage the weed.", "The current review aims to compile all the ethnobotanical, phytochemistry, biological activities and utilities, clinical studies and toxicity data available on P. hysterophorus and its major chemical constituent parthenin.", "Extensive literature surveyed Google search, Google scholar, Wiley online library, Elsevier, Springer, Science direct, American Chemical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry and Research Gate.", "According to the study, P. hysterophorus is utilized as a traditional medicine throughout Central America and the Caribbean. It can be used to treat skin infections, dermatitis, amoebic dysentery, and as an analgesic in the treatment of muscular rheumatism. The extracts obtained from P. hysterophorus have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, larvicidal, anti-microbial, insecticidal, hypoglycaemic and anti-cancer activity.", "The earlier investigations confirmed that P. hysterophorus has numerous traditional and biological applications. However, the scientific data are limited in clinical and toxicological studies. Therefore, further research is required on clinical and toxicological aspects to understand the complete potential and effects of P. hysterophorus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
