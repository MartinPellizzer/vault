Schischk essential oil was established based on gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In addition to an automated search of the NIST library, the identification of oxygenated monoterpenes, phenolic esters, and phenolic compounds was achieved by two additional strategies. One strategy involved comparing the relative errors of accurate masses measured for ions in the experimental spectra with those calculated for fragments identified from the NIST database of candidate matches. The second strategy involved combination of the product ion scans and positive chemical ionisation spectra for structural elucidation. Overall, 95.45% of the total essential oil volatile chemical content of Schizonepeta annua (Pall.) Schischk was identified, with phenolic monoterpenes dominating."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xinjiang Normal University, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xinjiang Normal University, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Maitusong", "ForeName": "Jumai", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Mahinur", "ForeName": "Bakri", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, China."}], "LastName": "Maiwulanjiang", "ForeName": "Maitinuer", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Mass Spectrom (Chichester)", "NlmUniqueID": "101124748", "ISSNLinking": "1469-0667"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30071758", "10.1177/1469066718791789"]}}]}
