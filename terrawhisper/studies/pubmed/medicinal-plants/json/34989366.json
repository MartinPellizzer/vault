The tree peony seeds, as emerging woody oil crops, recently have attracted great attention for their metabolites and bioactivities. In this study, the phytochemicals isolated from tree peony seed coats were systematically investigated. Seven polyphenolics were separated and prepared, mainly belonging to resveratrol derivatives. There was a great variation in the seed coat polyphenolic content among eight <i>Paeonia</i> species, and the contents of the resveratrol trimers and dimers were significantly higher in the seed coats of <i>Paeonia ostii</i> than other species. Based on the HPLC fingerprint characteristics and chemometric analysis, a clear discrimination among <i>Paeonia</i> plants was found, including the composition patterns and contents of the constituents. Moreover, the characteristic phytochemicals (vateriferol and <i>trans</i>-\u03b5-viniferin) could significantly reduce the starch-mediated levels of postprandial blood glucose in diabetic/normal mice. In addition, <i>in vitro</i> enzyme tests showed that the two compounds could effectively and competitively inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase, with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.01 and 7.75 \u03bcM, respectively, indicating that vateriferol and <i>trans</i>-\u03b5-viniferin could be therapeutic potential agents for hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4371-1254"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qinghai Provincial Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research and Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, CAS, Xining 810001, China. lzg@nwipb.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Weidong", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0018-6744"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qinghai Provincial Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research and Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, CAS, Xining 810001, China. lzg@nwipb.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zenggen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7774-437X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Beijing Botanical Garden, Institute of Botany, CAS, Beijing 100093, China. shuqy@ibcas.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Forestry Sci-tech Extension Station of Gansu Province, Lanzhou 730046, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lixia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ruilaiyin (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing 100094, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Linghao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Beijing Botanical Garden, Institute of Botany, CAS, Beijing 100093, China. shuqy@ibcas.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Qingyan", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34989366", "10.1039/d1fo03412j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
