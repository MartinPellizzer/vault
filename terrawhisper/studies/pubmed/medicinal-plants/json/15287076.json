The effect of PJBH extracts on H2O2-induced toxicity in the rat pheochromocytoma line PC12 was examined by measurements of cell lesion, level of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities, since free radicals are involved in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). After a 30 min exposure of the cells to H2O2 (150 microM), a marked decrease in cell survival, activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase as well as an increased production of malondialdehyde (MDA) were found. Pretreatment of the cells with PJBH (0.5-10 microg/ml) prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated cell survival, antioxidant enzyme activities and resulted in a decrease in the level of MDA. The effects of the PJBH on hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in PC12 cells were also examined. PJBH had a remarkable elevating effect on catalase and GSH-Px activities as well as cell survival, suggesting that cytoprotective effects of the PJBH are involved in stimulation against intermediate concentrations of H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury. The above-mentioned neuroprotective effects were also compared with the effect of tacrine. The results suggest that PJBH has potential for use as a novel neuronal therapeutic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Laboratory for Glycobiology, Ministry of Science and Technology of Korea, Kyungju, Kyungbuk, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koo", "ForeName": "Byung-Soo", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yeon-Kye", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Kyung-Su", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "Kang-Hyun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Cheorl-Ho", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15287076", "10.1002/ptr.1457"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
