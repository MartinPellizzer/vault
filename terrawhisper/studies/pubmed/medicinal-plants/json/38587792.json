It is distributed or cultivated worldwide, and the seeds of E. lathyris are the main source of ingenol, which is the precursor of Picato, the first medicine approved by USFDA for the treatment of solar keratosis (Abramovits et al. 2013). However, the production of E. lathyris can be severely hampered by the occurrence of plant diseases. Between 2020-2022 (specifically in October-November of each year), anthracnose-like symptoms were observed on E. lathyris in fields (E 118\u00b049'50\u2033, N 32\u00b03'33\u2033) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. The incidence of E. lathyris with disease symptoms was between 25%-30% (n = 100). The lesions on the leaves were evident initially as dark brown spots, which expanded into larger necrotic spots, finally resulting in leaves withering and dropping off. In severe cases, stem wilting was also observed. To determine the causal agent, we collected diseased leaf samples (n = 20) from different E. lathyris plants in the field (~ 1800 m2). After cleaning, the junctions of the diseased and healthy parts were excised and sterilized in 75% ethanol for 20-25 seconds, and rinsed with sterile water. After that, they were transferred onto potato sucrose agar (PSA) plates and placed at 25\u2103 for 3-4 days, until fungal growth was evident. The fungus was purified by recovering single conidia and growing them on PSA (Hu et al. 2015). A consistent fungal colony, based on morphological characteristics, was recovered from 17 samples. The colony color was initially white, green in the middle, and gradually changed into gray green as the colony matured. Conidia were transparent and cylindrical (22-28 \u00b5m \u00d7 7-9 \u00b5m, n = 50). Five loci informative (ITS, TUB, ACT, GAPDH, and CHS-1) (Weir et al. 2012) for Colletotrichum spp. identification were sequenced from two isolates ELC-1 and ELC-2 obtained from different plant individuals. Compared with a reference isolate (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides ZH3), the GAPDH, CHS-1, and TUB2 sequences of ELC-1 and ELC-2 showed 95% (263 bp out of 275 bp), 98% (295 bp out of 299 bp), and 99% (711 bp out of 712 bp and 717 bp out of 719 bp) similarity, respectively. The ITS sequence identities were 100% (577 bp out of 577 bp) and 99% (594 bp out of 597 bp), while the ACT sequence identities were 100% (281 bp out of 281 bp) and 98% (279 bp out of 284 bp). All sequences have been deposited in Genbank database (OR865865-OR865866 and OR873625-OR873632). After performing phylogenetic analysis with Mega 11, the pathogen was confirmed as C. gloeosporioides. To fulfil Koch's postulates, we sprayed six-week-old healthy plants with a conidia suspension of C. gloeosporioides (106 spores/mL) or sterile water (serve as control). The inoculated plants were placed at 25\u2103, 100% relative humidity, and 12-h photoperiod (Zhang et al. 2021). Six plants were inoculated for each treatment, and the experiment was repeated three times. After 6-8 days, the plants inoculated with C. gloeosporioides showed similar symptoms to those observed on diseased plants in the field, while the control plants remained healthy and free of disease. The pathogens were then re-isolated and identified as C. gloeosporioides. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. gloeosporioides causing anthracnose on E. lathyris. Anthracnose may cause significant yield losses in E. lathyris production, and our results will provide experimental and theoretical basis for the management of the disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, China; lcy55698@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chenyang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, China; 20231933@njucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, China; qiaosiwei1@163.com."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Siwei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, China; 15366627699@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ruyuan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, Chinananjing, China, 210014; wangbi@cnbg.net."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "nanjing, China; fengxucnbg@cnbg.net."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, China; ychen@jib.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NO.1 Qianhuhoucunnanjing, China, 210014; dawnxushu@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38587792", "10.1094/PDIS-12-23-2749-PDN"]}}]}
