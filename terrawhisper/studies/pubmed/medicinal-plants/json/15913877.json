Evodiae fructus extracts (2.5, 5, and 10 mL/kg-bw), a commercial hangover removal drug (2.5, 5, and 10 mL/kg-bw), and saline solution, referred to as treatment, positive control, and negative control group, respectively, were orally given at the same time as alcohol administered to mice (20% and 40% concentration). Alcohol concentrations were the lowest in all of the Evodiae fructus treatment groups, as well as one (10 mL/kg-bw) of the positive control groups, 4h after ethanol exposure (0-5mg/dL and 60-110 mg/dL for 20% and 40% ethanol-loaded mice, respectively). Overall, the relative expression of ADH and Zn-Cu SOD were higher in treatment groups than in positive controls; whereas, the relative expression of GPX5 was higher in positive control groups than in treatment groups. The relative expression of ALDH and CAT was unchanged between treatments and positive controls. This study suggests that Evodiae fructus extracts can be used as a possible therapy for alcohol-induced hangover symptoms by stimulating the expression of hepatic alcohol metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, College of Veterinary Medicine and School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Myung-Haing", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shim", "ForeName": "Soon-Mi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "So-Ra", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mar", "ForeName": "Woongcheon", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Gun-Hee", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15913877", "10.1016/j.fct.2005.03.010", "S0278-6915(05)00116-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
