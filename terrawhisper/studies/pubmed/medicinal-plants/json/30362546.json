Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression has been identified in postmortem human PD brain samples, in vitro and in vivo PD models. However, the role of miR-342-3p in PD has been understudied. The study explores the effects of miR-342-3p on expression of glutamate (Glu) transporter, and dopaminergic neuron apoptosis and proliferation by targeting p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) through the Wnt signaling pathway in PD mice. After establishment of PD mouse models, gain-\u00a0or loss-of-function assay was performed to explore the functional role of miR-342-3p in PD. Number of apoptotic neurons and Glu concentration was then determined. Subsequently, PC12 cells were treated with miR-342-3p mimic, miR-342-3p inhibitor, dickkopf-1 (DKK1), and miR-342-3p inhibitor\u2009+\u2009DKK1. The expression of miR-342-3p, PAK1, the Wnt signaling pathway-related and apoptosis-related genes, Glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT-1), l-glutamate/ l-aspartate transporter (GLAST), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was measured. Also, cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. PD mice exhibited increased miR-342-3p, while decreased expression of PAK1, GLT-1, GLAST, TH, and the Wnt signaling pathway-related and antiapoptosis genes. miR-342-3p downregulation could promote expression of PAK1, the Wnt signaling pathway-related and antiapoptosis genes. GLT-1, GLAST, and TH as well as cell viability, but reduce cell apoptosis rate. The results indicated that suppression of miR-342-3p improves expression of Glu transporter and promotes dopaminergic neuron proliferation while suppressing apoptosis through the Wnt signaling pathway by targeting PAK1 in mice with PD."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key
