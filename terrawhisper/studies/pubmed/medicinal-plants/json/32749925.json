In this study, the potential of dried powder of the arid-land medicinal shrub <i>Rhazya stricta</i> to control BW of tomato was explored. Both, in vitro and in planta studies were conducted, using different concentrations of dried powder of plant parts, and applied (surface mulched or mixed) to infested soil at 0, 10, and 20 days before transplanting (DBT). Aqueous extract of leaves (16% w/v) was found to be as effective as streptomycin (100 ppm) in inhibiting the in vitro growth of <i>R. solanacearum.</i> As evident from the scanning electron micrograph, 16% aqueous extract of leaves produced severe morphological changes, such as rupture of the bacterial cell walls. Results from the greenhouse experiments demonstrated that the higher powder dose (succulent shoot), namely, 30 g/kg of soil mixed with infested soil 20 DBT, was found to be the most effective in controlling BW. It increased root length (cm), shoot length (cm), and plant fresh biomass (g) by 55, 42, and 40%, respectively, over control plants. Mixing of plant powder with the artificially infested (35 ml of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml per kilogram of soil) pot soil was better than surface mulching. The 30 g/kg of soil dose mixed with soil increased root length (cm), shoot length (cm), and plant fresh biomass (g) of treated plants by 67, 36, and 46%, respectively, over control plants. A 37% decrease in disease severity over the control was observed with drench application of 30 g of powder per kilogram of soil applied once at 20 DBT. Our results indicated that the dried powder (30 g/kg of soil) of leaves or succulent shoots of <i>R. stricta</i>, thoroughly mixed with soil, 20 DBT, could act as an effective control method against BW."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5767-3466"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Raja Asad Ali", "Initials": "RAA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Syed Sartaj", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hayat", "ForeName": "Sania", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Musharaf", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Asad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naz", "ForeName": "Ishrat", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4841-9543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ralstonia solanacearum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32749925", "10.1094/PDIS-01-20-0032-RE"]}}]}
