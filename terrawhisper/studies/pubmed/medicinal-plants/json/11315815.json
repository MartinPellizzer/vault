The range of cadmium chloride (CdCl2 x 2.5H2O) concentrations was 10(-6) - 10(-2) M. Cadmium stimulated root length at lower concentrations (10(-6) - 10(-5) M) significantly (P < 0.005) during the entire treatment period. The seedlings exposed to 10(-3) - 10(-2) M Cd exhibited substantial growth reduction (P < 0.005), but did not develop chlorosis. Garlic has considerable ability to remove Cd from solutions and accumulate it. The Cd content in roots of garlic increased with increasing solution concentration of Cd2+. The roots in plants exposed to 10(-2) M Cd accumulated a large amount of Cd. approximately 1,826 times the control. The Cd contents in roots of plants treated with 10(-3), 10(-4), 10(-5) and 10(-6) M Cd were approximately 114, 59, 24 and 4 times the control, respectively. However, the plants transported only a small amount of Cd to their bulbs and shoots and concentrations in these tissues were low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Tianjin Normal University, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J6K4F9V3BA", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11315815", "10.1016/s0960-8524(00)00086-9", "S0960-8524(00)00086-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
