In this perspective, universities already engaged in research on medicinal mushrooms and on their potential applications in the industrial sector set the frame for collaboration with large, well-reputed private companies. In Italy, one of the major problems of mycotherapy is related to lack of certification and the dubious origin/identity of mushroom extracts used by the industry. Hence, products deriving from medicinal mushrooms that are in trade do not often meet the required quality criteria. In this paper, a multipartner collaboration is presented, which aims at the bottom to top development of nutraceutical products from Pleurotus mushrooms in agreement to science-to-business (S2B) marketing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of Bari \"Aldo Moro\", Via Amendola, 165/A, I-70126 Bari, Italy; Italian Society of Medicinal Mushrooms, Pisa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gargano", "ForeName": "Maria Letizia", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Italian Society of Medicinal Mushrooms, Pisa, Italy; Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Venturella", "ForeName": "Giuseppe", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of General and Agricultural Microbiology, Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Athens Iera Odos 75 11855 Athens, Greece."}], "LastName": "Zervakis", "ForeName": "Georgios I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Italian Society of Medicinal Mushrooms, Pisa, Italy; Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Calvo", "ForeName": "Roberta", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Italian Society of Medicinal Mushrooms, Pisa, Italy; Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ferraro", "ForeName": "Valeria", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Med Mushrooms", "NlmUniqueID": "100886202", "ISSNLinking": "1940-4344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "economics"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "economics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Science"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33463940", "10.1615/IntJMedMushrooms.2020036947", "7767f80a158163c5,5fc100210469187c"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
