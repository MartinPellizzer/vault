Some evidence suggests that LEV may impact adult neurogenesis, but the results are controversial. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of LEV on the proliferation and differentiation of rat embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) and to explore the role of GABA<sub>B</sub> or NMDA receptors.", "NSCs were isolated from rat fetal ganglionic eminence at embryonic day 14.5. The effects of LEV on viability, proliferation, neurosphere formation, and neuronal or astroglial differentiation of NSCs were assessed using resazurin, BrdU incorporation, immunocytochemistry, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blotting. Additionally, we addressed the relationship between treatment with NMDA and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists (MK801 and saclofen, respectively) in combination with LEV on these parameters.", "The data showed that LEV (50\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly increased the number (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and diameter of neurospheres (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), enhanced proliferation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and promoted neuronal differentiation, as revealed by significantly increased expressions of DCX and NeuN. The expressions of astroglial markers, GFAP and Olig2, were markedly reduced. The addition of MK801 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly diminished neurospheres growth (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), decreased the number of proliferating cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and reduced the number of new neurons (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but increased the astroglial cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) induced by LEV. Co-treatment with saclofen (25\u00a0\u03bcM) did not significantly affect LEV-induced NSCs proliferation and differentiation.", "Our findings suggest that LEV may enhance rat embryonic neurogenesis mainly through an NMDA receptor-mediated mechanism."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
