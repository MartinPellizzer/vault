As plants provide stable habitats for herbivores, herbivorous mites are rarely dependent on other animals for phoretic dispersal. However, a phoretic gall mite, Aceria pallida, which is found on plants, seasonally attaches to a herbivorous insect, Bactericera gobica, for overwintering survival. After detachment, the gall mite shares a habitat with its vector and is likely to compete with this vector for plant resources. However, excessive competition works against the sustainability of the seasonal phoretic association. How the gall mite, as an obligate phoretic mite, balances this relationship with its vector during the growing season to achieve phoresy is unknown. Here, the plant-mediated interspecific interaction between the gall mite and the psyllid after detachment was studied in the laboratory and field. The laboratory results showed that infestation by the gall mite had detrimental effects on the survival and development of psyllid nymphs. Meanwhile, the mite population and the gall size were also adversely affected. The results from the field showed that the mean densities of the mite galls and psyllids were lower in the mixed-species infestation treatment than in the single-species infestation treatment across the investigation period. However, the interspecific interaction between the gall mite and the psyllid decreased rather than accelerated leaf abscission caused by the psyllid, which promoted the persistence of the psyllid population and then indirectly contributed to phoretic association. Our results suggest that the plant-mediated competition between the phoretic gall mite and its vector after detachment facilitates the maintenance of the phoretic association."]}, "AuthorList":
