Resistance to current anthelmintics has prompted the search for new drugs. Anthelmintic metabolites from medicinal plants could be good anthelmintic drug candidates. However, the compounds active against nematodes have not been identified in most medicinal plants with anthelmintic activity. In this study, we aimed to identify the active compounds against helminths in Warburgia ugandensis Sprague subspecies ugandensis (Canellaceae) and study the underlying mechanism of action. A bioassay-guided isolation of anthelmintic compounds from the plant was performed using a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) test model with a WMicrotracker instrument to monitor motility. Three active compounds were purified and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and high resolution MS: warburganal (IC<sub>50</sub>: 28.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.6\u202f\u03bcM), polygodial (IC<sub>50</sub>: 13.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.3\u202f\u03bcM) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, IC<sub>50</sub>: 70.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f17.5\u202f\u03bcM). A checkerboard assay for warburganal and ALA as well as polygodial and ALA showed a fractional inhibitory concentration index of 0.41 and 0.37, respectively, suggesting that polygodial and ALA, as well as warburganal and ALA, have a synergistic effect against nematodes. A preliminary structure-activity relationship study for polygodial showed that the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated 1,4-dialdehyde structural motif is essential for the potent activity. None of a panel of C. elegans mutant strains, resistant against major anthelmintic drug classes, showed significant resistance to polygodial, implying that polygodial may block C. elegans motility through a mechanism which differs from that of currently marketed drugs. Further measurements showed that polygodial inhibits mitochondrial ATP synthesis of C. elegans in a dose-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0\u202f\u03bcM). Therefore, we believe that the underlying mechanism of action of polygodial is probably inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. In conclusion, polygodial could be a promising anthelmintic drug candidate worth considering for further development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Australian Society for Parasitology.
