O. decumbens has numerous pharmacological, food and feed, and cosmetic applications. This species is endemic to Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. Published literature, available until 30 November 2022 on the morphology, phytochemistry, and bioactivity of O. decumbens, has been reviewed, and appraised for the potential therapeutic potential of this species, utilizing the databases, Web of Science, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Dictionary of Natural Products. The search term used was O. decumbens. Some manuscripts were issued on the chemical components of O. decumbens essential oil (EO) and various extracts. The EO of O. decumbens was evaluated for its chemical composition and medicinal potential against various diseases. Thymol and carvacrol constituted the primary oxygenated monoterpenes detected in substantial amounts within the EO. Additionally, diverse metabolites of O. decumbens were examined for their bactericidal, antioxidant, larvicidal, and immunomodulatory effects. This review article discusses morphology, phenology, and geographical distribution of O. decumbens and presents a critical appraisal of its phytochemistry and therapeutic potential as documented in the published literature."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
