Withania somnifera is a highly valued medicinal plant. Recent demonstration of novel indolyl metabolites called withanamides in its fruits (berries) prompted us to investigate its tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), as tryptophan is invariably a precursor for indole moiety. TDC catalyzes conversion of tryptophan into tryptamine, and the catalytic reaction constitutes a committed metabolic step for synthesis of an array of indolyl metabolites. The TDC gene (WsTDC) was cloned from berries of the plant and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized for its catalytic attributes. Catalytic and structural aspects of the enzyme indicated its regulatory/rate-limiting significance in generation of the indolyl metabolites. Novel tissue-wise and developmentally differential abundance of WsTDC transcripts reflected its preeminent role in withanamide biogenesis in the fruits. Transgenic lines overexpressing WsTDC gene showed accumulation of tryptamine at significantly higher levels, while lines silenced for WsTDC exhibited considerably depleted levels of tryptamine. Cloning and sequence analysis of promoter of WsTDC revealed the presence of W-box in it. Follow-up studies on isolation of WsWRKY1 transcription factor and its overexpression in W. somnifera revealed that WsTDC expression was substantially induced by WsWRKY1 resulting in overproduction of tryptamine. The study invokes a key role of TDC in regulating the indolyl secondary metabolites through enabling elevated flux/supply of tryptamine at multiple levels from gene expression to catalytic attributes overall coordinated by WsWRKY1. This is the first biochemical, molecular, structural, physiological and regulatory description of a fruit-functional TDC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Jadaun", "ForeName": "Jyoti Singh", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Kushwaha", "ForeName": "Amit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7766-5428"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India. drneelamsangwan@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Haryana, Mahendergarh, Haryana, 123031, India. drneelamsangwan@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Neelam S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Narnoliya", "ForeName": "Lokesh Kumar", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Smrati", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Metabolic and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, India. dr.sangwan@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-HRDC Campus, Sector 19, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, 201002, India. dr.sangwan@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sangwan", "ForeName": "Rajender Singh", "Initials": "RS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "withanamide A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "422ZU9N5TV", "NameOfSubstance": "tryptamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.28", "NameOfSubstance": "Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Disaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tryptamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32789542", "10.1007/s00299-020-02574-4", "10.1007/s00299-020-02574-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
