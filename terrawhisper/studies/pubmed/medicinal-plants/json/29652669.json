There is a critical need for conducting research to discover, characterize and evaluate the efficacy of new strains of such bacteria in controlling highly aggressive plant pathogens. In this study, we isolated endophytic bacteria from medicinal plants of Bangladesh and evaluated their antagonistic capacity against an important phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Growth-promoting effects of those isolates on cucumber and rice seedlings were also assessed. Among 16 morphologically distinct isolates, BDR-2, BRtL-2 and BCL-1 significantly inhibited the growth of S. sclerotiorum through induction of characteristic morphological alterations in hyphae and reduction of mycelial dry weight. When cucumber and rice seeds were treated with these endophytic bacteria, seven isolates (BCL-1, BDL-1, BRtL-2, BRtL-3, BDR-1, BDR-2 and BBoS-1) enhanced seed germination, seedling vigor, seedling growth and number of roots per plant at a varying level compared to untreated controls. All isolates produced high levels of indole-3-acetic acid (6 to 63 \u03bcg/mL) in vitro. Two most potential isolates, BDR-2 and BRtL-2, were identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and B. subtilis, respectively, based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These results suggest that endophytic Bacillus species from native medicinal plants have great potential for being used as natural plant growth promoter and biopesticides in sustainable crop production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Ansary", "ForeName": "Waheda Rahman", "Initials": "WR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Prince", "ForeName": "Ferdous Rezwan Khan", "Initials": "FRK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Effi", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Farzana", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Sutton Bonington Campus, Loughborough LE12 5RD, UK."}], "LastName": "West", "ForeName": "Helen M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Mahbubur", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Bangladesh Open University, Board Bazar, Gazipur 1705, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Mondol", "ForeName": "Abdul Mojid", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Akanda", "ForeName": "Abdul Mannan", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Extension Service, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26505, USA."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Mahfuz", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Geography, University of Nottingham, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK."}], "LastName": "Clarke", "ForeName": "Michele L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Tofazzal", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis sativus"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, RNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29652669", "10.1515/znc-2018-0002", "/j/znc.ahead-of-print/znc-2018-0002/znc-2018-0002.xml"]}}]}
