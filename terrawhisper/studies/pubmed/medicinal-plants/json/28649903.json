While clinical trials have found some herbs to be as useful as standard psychiatric drugs, most clinicians are unaware of their pharmacological mechanisms.<b>Methods:</b> We searched English language and other language literature with English abstracts listed in PubMed website, supplemented by additional through Google Scholar's free academic paper abstract website for publications on herbs, focussing on their clinical use in mental disorders, their neurobiology and their pharmacology.<b>Results:</b> A major reason for herbs remaining outside of mainstream psychiatry is that the terminology and concepts in herbal medicine are not familiar to psychiatrists in general. Many publications regarding the use of herbal medicine for psychiatric disorders are deficient in details regarding diagnosis, criteria for response and the neurobiology details compared with publications on standard psychotropic drugs. Nomenclature for herbal medicine is usually confusing and is not conducive to an easy understanding of their mode of action in psychiatric disorders.<b>Conclusions:</b> The recent neuroscience-based nomenclature (NbN) for psychotropics methodology would be a logical application to herbal medicine in facilitating a better understanding of the use of herbal medicine in psychiatry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Brain Medicine, Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Siu W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Brain Medicine, Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Wayne H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Brain Medicine, Hong Kong, Hong Kong."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Leonard", "ForeName": "Brian E", "Initials": "BE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "World J Biol Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "101120023", "ISSNLinking": "1562-2975"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurosciences"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychiatry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28649903", "10.1080/15622975.2017.1346279"]}}]}
