Studies on the process of adipogenesis have been extensively performed in vivo and in vitro models to describe the molecular and cellular bases of adipose tissue development and the effect of natural products in this process. The a\u00e7ai seed extract (ASE) has been evidenced as a potential regulator of body mass. In our work high-fat diet-fed mice treated with ASE (300\u202fmg/Kg/d) (HFD-ASE) showed a lower adipose index (-32.63%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) than the high-fat diet-fed mice group (HFD) and the adipocytes from the HFD group were considerably enlarged (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared to those in the control group (CG) and HFD-ASE group (+175% and +123%, respectively). We also evaluated the effects of ASE on the modulation of adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. ASE exposure (25 and 100\u202f\u03bcg/mL) led to a decrease of 26.6 (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in proliferation and also inhibited pre-adipocyte differentiation through the decreasing expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) of transcription factors and adipogenic proteins such as PPAR\u0263, SREBP-1, and FAS. These results show that the ASE reduce adipogenesis and suppress lipid accumulation in the in vivo model and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and reinforce ASE as a potential strategy to modulate adipogenesis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
