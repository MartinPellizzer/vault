This work refers to the development of spray-dried powders (SDPs) from the 40% ethanolic extractive solution of P. edulis aerial parts. The SDPs were prepared with a B\u00fcchi 190 Mini-spray dryer using as drying adjuvants Aerosil 200 alone (SDP1), an Aerosil 200: Gelita-Sol-P (1:1) mixture (SDP2) and an Aerosil 200:Gelita-Sol-P (1:3) mixture (SDP3). All the powders were obtained using 40 parts adjuvant and 60 parts extract dried residue. The comparison criteria applied were particle size distribution, hygroscopicity at 95%, 60%, and 35% relative humidity (RH), as well as the flavonoid process recovery. The particle size distributions were analyzed by way of (a) normal distribution parameters, (b) the RRSB grid and (c) considering diameter values in terms of an equivalent sphere. All the powders presented nonnormal distribution, and the RRSB analysis appeared to be, therefore, the analysis method of choice. The total flavonoid recovery was around 80%, and it was practically not affected by the SDP1, SDP2, and SDP3 compositions. At the 60% and 90% RH atmospheres, the SDP3 and SDP2 moisture uptakes were higher than that of the SDP1. All the formulations were, on the contrary, stable at 35% RH, showing a slight moisture loss tendency. The results showed in sum that the SDP prepared using Aerosil 200 as the drying adjuvant alone presented the best technological characteristics of all."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Desenvolvimento Gal\u00eanico, Faculdade de Farm\u00e1cia/UFRGS, Porto Alegre RS, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Souza", "ForeName": "K C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Petrovick", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bassani", "ForeName": "V L", "Initials": "VL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ortega", "ForeName": "G G", "Initials": "GG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aerosols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aerosols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10738650", "10.1081/ddc-100100361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
