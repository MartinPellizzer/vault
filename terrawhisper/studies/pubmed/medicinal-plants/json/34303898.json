The newly prepared compounds were screened for glucose consumption activity in HepG2 cell lines. Aza-tetrahydrocarbazole compound 12b showed the most potent hypoglycemic activity with a 45% increase in glucose consumption when compared to the solvent control, which had approximately 1.2-fold higher activity than the positive control compounds (metformin and ZG02). An investigation of the potential mechanism indicated that 12b may exhibit hypoglycemic activity via activation of the AMPK pathway. Metabolic stability assays revealed that 12b showed good stability profiles in both artificial gastrointestinal fluids and blood plasma from SD rats. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and the results further confirmed that 12b was a potent hypoglycemic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
