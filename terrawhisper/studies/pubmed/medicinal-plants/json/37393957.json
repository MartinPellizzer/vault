The SVMPs from elapid venoms are not well elucidated, as compared with those from viperid and crotalid venoms. Atrase A is a nonhemorrhagic P-III SVMP purified from Naja atra venom that possesses only weak fibrinogenolytic activity. In our prior study, we found that atrase A detached adherent cells from the substrate. In this work, we investigated further the effect and mechanism of atrase A on endothelial cells. Oxidative damage, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and activation of the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways were measured after HMEC-1\u00a0cells were exposed to atrase A. The results showed that HMEC-1\u00a0cells released inflammatory mediators, exihibited oxidative damage and apoptosis after exposure to atrase A. The Western blot analysis results revealed that atrase A increased Bax/Bcl-2 and caspase-3 levels and activated the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways in endothelial cells. The effects on endothelial cells were nearly completely abolished after atrase A was treated with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. These results showed that atrase A led to an inflammatory response, cellular injury and apoptosis in endothelial cells, and this effect was due to its metalloproteinase domain. The study contributes to a better understanding of the structures and functions of cobra venom P-III class metalloproteinases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
