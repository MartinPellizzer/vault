It has the advantages of simple sample preparation, high sensitivity and no need for labeling. In recent years, MSI technology has been widely used in medicine, pharmacy, botany and other fields. Among them, the application of MSI technology in the research of medicinal plants provides a new technical idea for clarifying the pharmacological mechanism, improving the curative effect, tracking the distribution of toxic components, and makes an important contribution to the further development and utilization of medicinal plants. This review summarizes the research results of MSI technology in recent years for identification of medicinal plants, distribution of metabolites, pathway of active ingredient synthesis, medicinal safety and plant defense, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different research methods. Finally, the advantages and practical obstacles of MSI technology in medicinal plant research are briefly pointed out, and the prospects for the future development of MSI technology and medicinal plant research are also prospected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Information System of Mountainous Areas and Protection of Ecological Environment, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Guizhou Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control & Evaluation Technology of Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Research Center for Quality Control of Natural Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Information System of Mountainous Areas and Protection of Ecological Environment, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Guizhou Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control & Evaluation Technology of Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Research Center for Quality Control of Natural Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hua-Guo", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Information System of Mountainous Areas and Protection of Ecological Environment, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Guizhou Engineering Laboratory for Quality Control & Evaluation Technology of Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China Research Center for Quality Control of Natural Medicine, Guizhou Normal University Guiyang 550001, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237441", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191230.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
