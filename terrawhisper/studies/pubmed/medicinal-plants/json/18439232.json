Genetic relations and hybrids identification among different sections of Paeonia were studied using sequence related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. A total of 29 cultivars including 2 intersectional hybrids, 13 sect. Moutan and 14 from sect. Paeonia were used. A total of 197 bands were produced using 24 primer combinations, among which 187 bands showed polymorphism. From the bands amplified, we can identify the peony cultivars using unique SRAP markers and specific primer combinations. Fourteen peony cultivars were distinguished among each other by using totally 35 SRAP markers, which were generated by 16 primer pairs. Two specific primer pairs of Me8/Em8 and Me8/Em1 can be used to identify cultivars from different sections. The mean genetic similarity coefficient (GS), the gene diversity (GD), and the Shannon's information index of peony cultivars were 0.45, 0.19 and 0.32, respectively. Both UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method of arithmetic average) dendrogram and PCA (principle component analysis) analysis showed clear genetic relationships among the 29 peony cultivars, and within section and its intersectional hybrids. The above results are valuable for estimating and analyzing genetic background of Paeonia, parent selection in crossing breeding programs, molecular marker assisted selection (MAS) breeding for further germplasm innovation programs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Botanical Garden, Institute of Botany, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiangshan, Haidian District, Beijing, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zheng-An", "Initials": "ZA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Qing-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rui'e", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "De Rick", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Liang-Sheng", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hereditas", "NlmUniqueID": "0374654", "ISSNLinking": "0018-0661"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chimera"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18439232", "10.1111/j.0018-0661.2008.2013.x", "HRD2013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
