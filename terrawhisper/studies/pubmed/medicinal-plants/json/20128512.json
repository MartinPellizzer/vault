Two independent experiments were performed to establish callus and plant regeneration. In the first experiment, leaf segments were cultured on MS basal medium fortified with 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4-D, 2-4 mg L(-1)) with combination of 6-benzyladenine (BA, 0.5-1 mg L(-1)) or kinetin (Kin, 0.5-1 mg L(-1)). Callus initiation was observed best in all media after 14-16 days (100%). Highest callus growth in terms of dry weight (76 +/- 5.34 mg) was observed in MS medium fortified with 2 mg L(-1) 2, 4-D and 0.5 mg L(-1) Kin. In the second experiment, callusing also obtained from internode segments cultured on MS medium with the presence of 2, 4-D (2-4 mg L(-1)) in association with BA (0.25-0.5 mg L(-1)). Best callusing rates (42%) and dry weight (86 +/- 3.68 mg) occurred in the presence of 4 mg L(-1) 2, 4-D with combination of 0.25 mg L(-1) BA. Shoot induction was obtained just from callus induced from internode explants on MS medium containing BA (2 mg L(-1)) with IBA (0.5 mg L(-1)), but the yield of shoot regeneration was unsatisfactory (18-33%). Regenerated shoots were rooted best (100%) on half strength MS medium containing IBA (2 mg L(-1)) and produced 23 roots with an average root length of 6.5 +/- 0.41 cm. Rooted plantlets transferred to soil and sand mixture (2:1) showed 75% survival when transferred to outdoor.
