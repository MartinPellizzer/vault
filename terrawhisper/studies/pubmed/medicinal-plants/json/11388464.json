In Sophora flavescens and Glycyrrhiza glabra cultured cells, cork tissues increased the amounts of both lipophilic and hydrophilic flavonoids without affecting the cell growth, although elicitors such as copper ion and yeast extracts showed a clear inhibition of cell growth with the increasing amount of these lipophilic ones. The validity of this effect of cork tissues covered a wide range of aromatic compounds produced by suspension cell cultures derived from diverse plant species. Woody tissues of Japanese cypress had a very similar effect to that of cork. Partial purification of cork tissues suggested that the production-stimulating factor was present in the hemicellulose B fraction that was not included in the dedifferentiated cultured tissues."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Garden, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yato", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazaki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayashi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taguchi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8024-50-8", "NameOfSubstance": "hemicellulose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coculture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Prenylation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11388464", "10.1271/bbb.65.853"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
