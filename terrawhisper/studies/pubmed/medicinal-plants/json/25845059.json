Securinine (1), the most abundant and studied alkaloid of this series was isolated by Russian researchers in 1956. In the following years, French and Japanese scientists reported other Securinega compounds and extensive work was done to elucidate their intriguing structures. The homogeneity of this family relies mainly on its tetracyclic chemical backbone, which features a butenolide moiety (cycle D) and an azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane ring system (rings B and C). Interestingly, after a period of latency of 20 years, the Securinega topic reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures and to date more than 50 compounds have been identified and characterized. The oligomeric subgroup gathering dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric units is of particular interest. The unprecedented structure of the Securinega alkaloids was the subject of extensive synthetic efforts culminating in several efficient and elegant total syntheses. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids seems limited to the Securinega, Flueggea, Margaritaria, and Breynia genera (Phyllanthaceae). However, only a limited number of plant species have been considered for their alkaloid contents, and additional phytochemical as well as genetic studies are needed. Concerning the biosynthesis, experiments carried out with radiolabelled aminoacids allowed to identify lysine and tyrosine as the precursors of the piperidine ring A and the CD rings of securinine (1), respectively. Besides, plausible biosynthetic pathways were proposed for virosaine A (38) and B (39), flueggine A (46), and also the different oligomers flueggenine A-D (48-51), fluevirosinine A (56), and flueggedine (20). The case of nirurine (45) and secu'amamine (37) remains elusive and additional studies seem necessary to understand their mode of production. The scope of biological of activities of the Securinega alkaloids was mainly centered on the CNS activity of securinine (1), although the exact mechanism of action remained in part unknown. Nevertheless, for its stimulant and antispasmodic effects securinine nitrate was marketed as a drug in the USSR until the early 1990s. Moreover, securinine (1) and several other Securinega alkaloids recently demonstrated promising anticancer properties. In particular securinine (1) demonstrated markedly benefits in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chirkin", "ForeName": "Eqor", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Atkatlian", "ForeName": "William", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Por\u00e9e", "ForeName": "Fran\u00e7ois-Hugues", "Initials": "FH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Alkaloids Chem Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812842", "ISSNLinking": "1099-4831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indolizines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tropanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "flueggine A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "virosaine A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "96253-68-8", "NameOfSubstance": "nirurin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G4VS580P5E", "NameOfSubstance": "securinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azepines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indolizines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tropanes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25845059", "10.1016/bs.alkal.2014.11.001"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
