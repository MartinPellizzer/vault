Many triterpene derivatives have been shown to possess medicinally relevant biological activity. However, thus far this potential has not translated into a plethora of triterpene-derived drugs in the clinic. This is arguably (at least partially) a consequence of limited practical synthetic access to this class of compound, a problem that can stifle the exploration of structure-activity relationships and development of lead candidates by traditional medicinal chemistry workflows. Despite their immense diversity, triterpenes are all derived from a single linear precursor, 2,3-oxidosqualene. Transient heterologous expression of biosynthetic enzymes in N. benthamiana can divert endogenous supplies of 2,3-oxidosqualene towards the production of new high-value triterpene products that are not naturally produced by this host. Agro-infiltration is an efficient and simple means of achieving transient expression in N. benthamiana. The process involves infiltration of plant leaves with a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens carrying the expression construct(s) of interest. Co-infiltration of an additional A. tumefaciens strain carrying an expression construct encoding an enzyme that boosts precursor supply significantly increases yields. After a period of five days, the infiltrated leaf material can be harvested and processed to extract and isolate the resulting triterpene product(s). This is a process that is linearly and reliably scalable, simply by increasing the number of plants used in the experiment. Herein is described a protocol for rapid preparative-scale production of triterpenes utilizing this plant-based platform. The protocol utilizes an easily replicable vacuum infiltration apparatus, which allows the simultaneous infiltration of up to four plants, enabling batch-wise infiltration of hundreds of plants in a short period of time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre."}], "LastName": "Stephenson", "ForeName": "Michael J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre."}], "LastName": "Reed", "ForeName": "James", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre."}], "LastName": "Brouwer", "ForeName": "Bastiaan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "John Innes Centre; anne.osbourn@jic.ac.uk."}], "LastName": "Osbourn", "ForeName": "Anne", "Initials": "A"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BBS/E/J/00000614", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BB/KEC1740/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BBS/E/J/000PR9790", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BB/P012523/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BB/L014130/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Thimmappa R, et al.
