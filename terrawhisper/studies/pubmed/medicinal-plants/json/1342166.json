Walp), a batch of 180 cans was stocked at room temperature (22 degrees C to 32 degrees C) for a period of six months. At intervals of 0, 30, 90 and 180 days, 26 samples collected randomly were submitted to physicochemical, sensory and biological analyses. Significant statistical reductions (p < or = 0.01 to p < or = 0.05) were observed due to storage time, having this significance increased for proteins after 90 days and for lipids after 30 days, as well as a decrease on the amino acid values, thus indicating the occurrence of chemical reactions, although acceptance of the product was found to be satisfactory throughout the whole experiment. No evidence was discovered of the presence of gas producer microorganisms. According to physicochemical analyses, quantitative losses in protein, lipids, available methionine and lysine did not seem to affect protein quality, in spite of a significant reduction (p < or = 0.01) in weight gain and Coefficient of Food Efficiency of samples stored for 180 days when compared to those freshly canned on day 0, though values for Net Protein Ratio (NPR) showed no discernible decrease; these data lead to the conclusion that canned cowpeas stored can be consumed without, restrictions, in spite of the slight decrease in biological value caused by the time of storage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o, Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Brasil."}], "LastName": "Lira", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guerra", "ForeName": "N B", "Initials": "NB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pessoa", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Propriedades nutricionais e sensoriais do feij\u00e3o mac\u00e1\u00e7ar verde (Vigna unguiculata (L.)
