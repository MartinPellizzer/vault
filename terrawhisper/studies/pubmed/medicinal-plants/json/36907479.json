P. japonicum has been used in traditional medicine to soothe coughs and colds, and to treat many other inflammatory diseases. However, there are no studies on the anti-inflammatory effects of the leaves.", "Inflammation plays an important role in our body as a defense response of biological tissues to certain stimuli. However, the excessive inflammatory response can lead to various diseases. This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of P. japonicum leaves extract (PJLE) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7\u00a0cells.", "Nitric Oxide (NO) production assay measured by NO assay. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS), COX-2, MAPKs, AKT, NF-\u03baB, HO-1, Nrf-2 were examined by western blotting. PGE<sub>2</sub>, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 were analyzed by ELSIA. Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB was detected by immunofluorescence staining.", "PJLE suppressed inducible nitric oxygen synthase (iNOS) and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2) expression, increased heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression, and decreased nitric oxide production. And PJLE inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB. Taken together, PJLE down-regulated inflammatory factors such as iNOS and COX-2 by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT, MAPK, and NF-\u03baB.", "These results suggest that PJLE can be used as a therapeutic material to modulate inflammatory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
