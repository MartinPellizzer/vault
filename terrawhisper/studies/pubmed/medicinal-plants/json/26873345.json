Due to increased resistance against conventional antibiotics, researchers and pharmaceutical industries are more concerned about novel therapeutic agents for the prevention of bacterial infections. Enormous wealth of traditional system of medicine gains importance in health therapies over again. With ancient credentials of potent medicinal plants, various herbal remedies came forward for the management of bacterial infections. The Ayurvedic approach facilitates the development of new therapeutic agents due to structural and functional diversity among phytochemicals. The abundance and diversity is responsible for the characterization of new lead structures from medicinal plants. Industrial interest has increased due to recent research advancements viz. synergistic and high-throughput screening approach for the evaluation of vast variety of phytochemicals. The review certainly emphasizes on the traditional medicines as alternatives to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. The review briefly describes mode of action of various antibiotics and resistance mechanisms. This review focuses on the chemical diversity and various mechanisms of action of phytochemicals against bacterial pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khatri", "ForeName": "Savita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Manish", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phougat", "ForeName": "Neetu", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chaudhary", "ForeName": "Renu", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Biotechnology, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India. aachhillar@rediffmail.com."}], "LastName": "Chhillar", "ForeName": "Anil Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26873345", "10.2174/138955751604160201150438", "MRMC-EPUB-73394"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
