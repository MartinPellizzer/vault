Arginyl-fructose and arginyl-fructosyl-glucose from Korean red ginseng were found to inhibit protein methylase I activity in vitro. This inhibitory activity was shown to be due to arginyl moiety in the molecules, rather than that of carbohydrates. Several basic amino acids as well as polyamines were also found to inhibit protein methylase I activity. Interestingly, the intensity of the inhibitory activity was correlated with the number of amino-group in polyamines, thus, in the order of spermine > spermidine > putrescine > agmatine-sulfate, with IC50 at approximately 15 mM, 25 mM, 35 mM, and 50 mM, respectively. On the other hand, neutral amino acids or NaCl did not inhibit the enzyme activity. Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis of the protein methylase I activity in the presence of arginine and spermidine indicated that the inhibition was competitive in nature in respect to protein substrate, with the Ki values of 24.8 mM and 11.5 mM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Medical School, Korea University, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takaku", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "W I", "Initials": "WI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Amino Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "9200312", "ISSNLinking": "0939-4451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.319", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U87FK77H25", "NameOfSubstance": "Spermidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10707768", "10.1007/BF01361664"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
