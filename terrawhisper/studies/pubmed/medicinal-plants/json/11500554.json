On a whole-plant basis, the diverted reductant utilization rate (DRUR which is: 4 x [CER + OER]) of shoot tissue was consistently higher than that of roots, and values obtained in the light were greater than those in the dark. An analysis of the biomass being synthesized over a 24-h period provided an estimate of whole-plant DRUR (3.5 mmol e(-) plant(-1) d(-1)), which was similar to that measured by gas exchange (3.2 mmol e(-) plant(-1) d(-1)). Given that nitrate reduction to ammonia makes up about 74% of whole-plant DRUR, root nitrate reduction in white lupin was estimated to account for less than 43% of whole-plant nitrate reduction. The approach developed here should offer a powerful tool for the noninvasive study of metabolic regulation in intact plants or plant organs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cen", "ForeName": "Y P", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Turpin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Layzell", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Allen S, Raven JA.
