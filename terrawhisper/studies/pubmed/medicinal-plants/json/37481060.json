In traditional medicine, Mentha arvensis, commonly known as mint, has many applications, and in the present study, the mint leaf extract has been used to synthesis nanoparticles using the mint leaf extract as a biosource for the extraction of nanoparticles. In addition to having a wide range of applications in various fields, calcium oxide (CaO) nanoparticles are also considered to be safe for human use. In order to assess the characteristics of the abstracted CaO nanoparticles, UV-visible absorption spectrophotometers, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometers (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEMs), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), and X-ray Diffraction Spectrophotometers (XRDs) were used. By conducting a protein denaturation assay and nitric oxide scavenging assay, mint leaf mediated CaO nanoparticles were evaluated for their therapeutic applications. MTT assays were used to prove that the CaO nanoparticles mediated by mint leaf had anti-cancer properties. By examining the ability of mint leaf mediated CaO nanoparticles to degrade various dyes such as methyl red, methyl orange, and methylene blue, which are the most used azo dyes in textile industries resulting in water contamination, the ability of these nanoparticles to act as a photocatalytic agent was examined."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
