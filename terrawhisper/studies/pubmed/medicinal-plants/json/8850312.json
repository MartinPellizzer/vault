This substance was determined to be des(alpha-carboxy-3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl)lithospermic acid on the basis of spectrometric and chemical evidence, and was identified with an authentic sample of 8-epiblechnic acid. However, comp. III seemed to be formed from lithospermic acid (LSA) and LSA-B during a chemical procedure to separate active ingredients. It caused a sustained, slowly developing relaxation of rat aortic strips precontracted with norepinephrine (NE) in preparations with or without endothelium. The NE-induced concentration-dependent contraction of aortic strips was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with comp. III. Concentration-response curves for Ca(2+)-induced contracture of depolarized aortic strips with isotonic high K+ (60 nM) were not affected by comp. III. Ca(2+)-induced contraction of aortic strips, preincubated with 10(-6) M NE in the presence of 10(-6) M nicardipine and 0.01 mM EGTA in Ca(2+)-free solution, was slightly inhibited by comp. III. Pretreatment of aortic strips with comp. III slightly inhibited the phorbol ester (PMA)-induced contraction. These results suggest that comp. III inhibits NE-induced contraction of the aortic strips through reduction in Ca2+ mobilization. Since comp. III inhibits NE-induced sustained contraction, this agent may be useful in the treatment of hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Hoshi University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nagai", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noguchi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iizuka", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otani", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamata", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "100IP83JAC", "NameOfSubstance": "lithospermic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4W3ENH1CV", "NameOfSubstance": "Norepinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Norepinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8850312", "10.1248/bpb.19.228"]}}]}
