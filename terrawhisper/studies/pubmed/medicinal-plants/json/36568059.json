This research aimed to identify the phytoconstituents in the extracts of <i>P. emblica</i> stem barks and hypothesize their antidiabetic potentials based on <i>in silico</i> drug-likeliness. Simplicia of <i>P. emblica</i> powder was sequentially macerated at room temperature (24 h) using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol solvents. Phytochemical profiles of the extract were investigated qualitatively using reagents, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. All phytocompounds were then analyzed for their pharmacological properties and predicted bioactivities on molinspiration. Cytotoxicity of each extract was evaluated using the brine shrimp lethality test. As many as 18 compounds (from GC-MS), were identified in all extract samples from <i>P. emblica</i> stem barks. Based on <i>in silico</i> drug-likeliness, methanol extract contained the most potentially bioactive compounds (16\u03b1-hydroxycleroda-3,13 (14) Z-dien-15,16-olide; 14-. beta.-H-pregna; and isochiapin B). Isochiapin B was revealed as the only compound that had no violation of the rule of five. All three compounds could hypothetically contribute to the antidiabetic activity of the methanol extract from <i>P. emblica</i> stem barks by inhibiting diabetes-related enzymes and interacting with nuclear receptors. Moderate cytotoxicity of ethyl acetate and methanol extract, respectively, further suggests their bioactivities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Journal of Advanced Pharmaceutical Technology & Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Mathematics and Applied Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Quranayati", "ForeName": "Quranayati", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Mathematics and Applied Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Iqhrammullah", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Saidi", "ForeName": "Nurdin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Veterinary Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Nurliana", "ForeName": "Nurliana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Idroes", "ForeName": "Rinaldi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Nasution", "ForeName": "Rosnani", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Adv Pharm Technol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101537797", "ISSNLinking": "0976-2094"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kasole R, Martin HD, Kimiywe J.
