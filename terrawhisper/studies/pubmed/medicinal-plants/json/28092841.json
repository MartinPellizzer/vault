The aim of this work was to study the antioxidant effects of previous supplementation with fenugreek seeds (FS) against carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>) toxicity in the liver and kidney. CCl<sub>4</sub> toxicity was induced by one dose (i.g. 5ml CCl<sub>4</sub>/kg of body weight, 50% CCl<sub>4</sub> in olive oil) after 7 weeks of normal diet or diet rich in 10% of grinded fenugreek seeds (20g of pellet rat food/rat/day). 24h after the treatment with CCl<sub>4</sub>, all animals were scarified and biological analyses were performed. A phytochemical study of fenugreek seed extract (FSE) was also carried out. The phytochemical analysis of FS and FSE revealed the presence of polyphenols (5.92\u00b10.02mg EGA/g DM), flavonoids (0.44\u00b10.19mg ER/g DM), polysaccharides and trace elements. DPPH radical-scavenging activity of FSE showed an EC50 of 285.59\u00b12.01\u03bcg/ml. In vivo, CCl<sub>4</sub> administration significantly (p<0.05) induced an increase liver and kidney biomarkers. A significant (p<0.05) alteration of the antioxidant enzyme activities was also observed. In animals pretreated with FS, the studied parameters were much less shifted. These results indicate that the supplementation with fenugreek seeds is significantly effective in protecting the liver and kidneys from CCl<sub>4</sub> toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
