These plants have been traditionally used in various parts of the world for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. Major depression is a common, long-lasting, and recurrent psychiatric disorder with a high suicide rate. Naturally occurring flavonoids treat depression via poorly understood mechanisms.", "The present study aimed to determine whether ononin conferred an antidepressant-like effect in PC12\u00a0cell models and chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced depressive rat models and to explore its possible mechanisms.", "Depression-related behaviors were measured using sucrose preference, tail suspension and open-field tests. Furthermore, to explore these mechanisms, we employed in vitro and in vivo assay methods, including neurite outgrowth, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, and staining methods.", "Treatment with ononin or BDNF significantly increased PC12\u00a0cells' neuronal growth and differentiation. Furthermore, ononin promotes the activation of TrkB and growth factors and upregulates the PI3K/Akt and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathways. The in vitro results were consistent with CMS-induced depressive rat models, in which ononin treatment significantly decreased depression-like behaviors and activated TrkB, growth factors, and BDNF/TrkB/CREB signaling pathways in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Depression-induced microscopic alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats with CMS-induced depression were also mitigated following ononin treatment.", "Based on these findings, we suggest that ononin is a promising antidepressant candidate for treating depression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
