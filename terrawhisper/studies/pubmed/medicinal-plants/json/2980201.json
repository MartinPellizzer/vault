Contrary to previous data (Bassam et al. 1986), mutagenesis of the 17-kb XhoI fragment with a mini-Mu lac transposon (Mu dII1734) showed that a functional nodD 1 gene was essential for extended host range. Gene expression studies using both Mu dII1734 fusions and a promoter-cloning vector indicated that several loci, including the nodD 1 gene, are constitutively expressed. No evidence was found for regulation of the strain NGR234 nodD 1 gene by its product. Another locus nod-81, was induced only in the presence of exudates from various plant species, including soybean (Glycine max). Whereas the expression of nod-81 was dependent on the presence of a functional nodD 1 gene product, a regulatory nod-box DNA sequence was not detected 5' to this gene by using available oligonucleotide hybridization probes. The nod-81 locus was induced by genistein, daidzein, naringenin, and coumestrol from both cotyledon and root tissue of freshly germinated soybean seedlings. A broad spectrum of commercially available phenolic compounds stimulated induction of the nod-81 locus, including some that antagonize nod gene induction in other Rhizobium species. The nodD 1 gene product from strain NGR234 was shown to determine the spectrum of compounds that induce nod-81 expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research School of Biological Sciences, Australian National University, Canberra."}], "LastName": "Bassam", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Djordjevic", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Redmond", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Batley", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rolfe", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Insertional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2980201", "10.1094/mpmi-1-161"]}}]}
