Convolvulaceae is a family comprising approximately 1,600-1,700 species grouped in 55-60 genera, and many species are reported to have an effect on CNS functions. A systematic review of the literature studies was carried out to summarize available evidences on Convolvulaceae plants with CNS efficacies. This review is based on various data sources such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Wanfang Data. A total of 200 related articles were included in this review. According to the research result, 54 Convolvulaceae species are suggested to display CNS efficacies historically, and 46 species have been evaluated for their CNS efficacies. In addition, 67 compounds from 16 Convolvulaceae species are recognized to possess CNS efficacies. Despite great progress made through pharmacology and phytochemistry studies on CNS active Convolvulaceae species, more exploratory research is needed to gain a better understanding of the CNS efficacies of this plant family."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, 19 Qixiu Road, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, 226001, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang-Tong", "Initials": "GT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, 19 Qixiu Road, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, 226001, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, 19 Qixiu Road, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, 226001, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, 19 Qixiu Road, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, 226001, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1581-8422"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nantong University, 19 Qixiu Road, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, 226001, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Bo-Yi", "Initials": "BY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Convolvulaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29356185", "10.1002/ptr.6031"]}}]}
