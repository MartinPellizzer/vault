The MS medium with KT 2 mg x L(-1) and NAA 0.2 mg x L(-1) was much better than others when callus were induced. The MS medium with KT 2 mg x L(-1) + NAA 0.2 mg x L(-1) and AgNO3 5 mg x L(-1) was the preferable medium for the bud sprouting. The frequency of plantlets regeneration which was induced by flower bud was higher than that by opening petal.
