Using plants from 10 sites in 4 provinces, including pristine and industrial regions, and employing the metal-free, ultraclean SWAMP laboratory facilities and procedures, we provide an estimate of the natural abundance of trace elements in the leaves, and the extent of their release during hot water extraction. Elements decrease in abundance in the order Mn\u00a0>\u00a0Al\u00a0>\u00a0Fe\u00a0>\u00a0Zn\u00a0>\u00a0Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Ni\u00a0>\u00a0V\u00a0>\u00a0Pb\u00a0>\u00a0La\u00a0>\u00a0Mo\u00a0>\u00a0Y\u00a0>\u00a0La\u00a0>\u00a0Tl\u00a0>\u00a0Cd\u00a0>\u00a0Th\u00a0>\u00a0Ag. The greatest concentrations of conservative, lithophile elements such as Al, La, Th and Y, are found in samples collected on lands reclaimed from open pit bitumen mines in northern Alberta, reflecting elevated inputs of atmospheric dusts. In contrast, micronutrients such as Cu and Zn are remarkably uniform which suggests that these are supplied almost exclusively by plant uptake via roots. Deionized, reverse osmosis water is more effective in removing some elements (e.g. Al, La, Y, Fe, Zn, Cd) whereas others are more readily extracted using groundwater (e.g. Cu, Ni, Pb); V behaves independently of water composition. In both types of water, the elements most readily extracted are plant micronutrients (Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn) whereas those supplied primarily by dust exhibit much lower yields; Al shows behaviour intermediate between these two extremes. While element concentrations in the infusions increase with increasing concentrations in the leaves, the abundance of potentially toxic chalcophile elements such as Cd, Pb, Sb and Tl in the infusions are extremely low (ng/l). Plants from British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec provide evidence of atmospheric Pb contamination, yielding greater ratios of Pb/La compared to the samples from Alberta where crustal values are found. Given that this plant is common and found across the northern half of the continent, it shows great promise as a tool for biomonitoring of air quality. For consumers, Labrador Tea may represent an important dietary source of Mn."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
