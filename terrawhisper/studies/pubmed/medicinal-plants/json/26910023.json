The high level of acquired and intrinsic resistance mechanisms of these bacteria makes it an urgent requirement to find a suitable alternative to carbapenem, a commonly prescribed drug for Acinetobacter infection. In this study, methanolic extracts of six medicinal plants were subjected to phytochemical screening and their antimicrobial activity was tested against two strains of A. baumannii (ATCC 19606, carbapenem-sensitive strain, and RS 307, carbapenem-resistant strain). Synergistic effect of the plant extracts and antibiotics was also tested. Bael or Aegle marmelos contains tannin, phenol, terpenoids, glycoside, alkaloids, coumarine, steroid, and quinones. Flowers of madar or Calotropis procera possess tannin, phenol, terpenoids, glycoside, quinone, anthraquinone, anthocyanin, coumarin, and steroid. An inhibitory growth curve was seen for both the bacterial strains when treated with A. marmelos, Curcuma longa, and leaves and flowers of C. procera. Antibiotics alone showed a small zone of inhibition, but when used with herbal extracts they exhibited larger zone of inhibition. Synergistic effect of A. marmelos and imipenem was the best against both the strains of A. baumannii. From this study, it can be concluded that extracts from A. marmelos and leaves and flowers of C. procera exhibited the most effective antibacterial activity. These herbal extracts may be used to screen the bioactive compound against the carbapenem-resistant strain of A. baumannii."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Rajasthan , Ajmer, India ."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Monalisa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Rajasthan , Ajmer, India ."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Ranita", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Central University of Rajasthan , Ajmer, India ."}], "LastName": "Tiwari", "ForeName": "Vishvanath", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microb Drug Resist", "NlmUniqueID": "9508567", "ISSNLinking": "1076-6294"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "71OTZ9ZE0A", "NameOfSubstance": "Imipenem"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Acinetobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Acinetobacter baumannii"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aegle"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imipenem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Lactam Resistance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26910023", "10.1089/mdr.2015.0270"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
