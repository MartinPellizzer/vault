Calculation of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and <i>E</i><sub>gap</sub> revealed that aloe-emodin has the lowest <i>E</i><sub>gap</sub> value, indicating good antioxidant activity. Also in terms of electron affinity, softness, electrophilicity, and chemical potential, aloe-emodin is a potent structure with potential high radical scavenging activity. Calculation of the ionisation potential revealed that isoeleutherol likely also possesses a high degree of antiradical scavenging. To study the conjugating system of the radicals, density plots of HOMO, natural bond orbital analyses, and spin density plots were used. According to calculations, the isoeleutherol radical is more delocalised and the most stable radical. Calculated proton affinity values revealed that the most probable antioxidant mechanism is sequential proton loss-electron transfer. Our results were compared with available experimental data. Published experimental data were found to correlate well with our theoretical predictions. These results support the usefulness of theoretical calculations not only for identifying potentially useful structures of studied compounds but also for predicting their relative activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Reza Nazifi", "ForeName": "S Mohamad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgharshamsi", "ForeName": "Mohammad H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Dehkordi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of General Chemistry, Jagiellonian University , Krak\u00f3w , Poland."}], "LastName": "Zborowski", "ForeName": "Krzysztof K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9423872", "ISSNLinking": "1029-2470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "aloesone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C8IYT9CR7C", "NameOfSubstance": "aloe emodin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31357895", "10.1080/10715762.2019.1648798"]}}]}
