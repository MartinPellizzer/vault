In addition, 2-undecanone contents in aerial parts of H. cordata (14.9 microg g(-1)) fertilized with manure of human were also higher than that with chemical fertilizer, pig and duck manures, but no significant difference were found among the other treatments in aerial or underground parts of the plants, respectively. The results also demonstrated that fertilized with organic fertilizer might be beneficial to enhance the quality of sugar in H. cordata, mainly including the contents of total sugar, solutable sugar, fructose and reduced sugar in the plants, especially with manure of human and pig.", "As the result of this study and the related previous research on yield of H. cordata were considered, the fertilizing ways for increasing quality of H. cordata should take the manure of human as a main fertilizer and mix with the other organic fertilizers, complex fertilizers and chemical ones may be needed to balance the plant nutrient. In the field practice, the amount of organic fertilizer including 108,000 kg hm(-2) human mature, together with some high-efficient complex fertilizer and a small amount of quick-acting chemical fertilizer is recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture & Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Rui-yu", "Initials": "RY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hao-sen", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Xiao-xia", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-yi", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Chun-hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-fang", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wen-xiong", "Initials": "WX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30237-26-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YV5DSO8CY9", "NameOfSubstance": "undecan-2-one"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ducks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Houttuynia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ketones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18257256"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
