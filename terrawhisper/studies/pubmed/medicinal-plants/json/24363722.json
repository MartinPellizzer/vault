Water withdrawing for 15 days in male Wister strain albino rats resulted in a significant elevation in the level of blood nitrogenous products (i.e. urea and creatinine). On the other hand, it increased the levels of free radicals, melondialdehyde (MDA) and conjugated dienes (CD) along with a significant diminution in the activities of superoxide dismutse (SOD) and catalase in blood. All these water markers were significantly prevented after administration of aqueous extract of Terminalia arjuna bark. These results suggest that dehydration induced oxidative stress and uremia in male rats may be protected by using the above mentioned medicinal plants extract. This herbal extract showed no toxic effect on blood and kidney, based on the measurements of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and glutamic pyruvic transaminase activities (data not shown)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Physiology and Department of Nutrition, Raja N L Khans Women's College, Midnapore, West Bengal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Koushik", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Post Graduate Department of Zoology, West Bengal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pratim Chakraborty", "ForeName": "Partha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Laboratory Science and Management, Vidyasagar University, West Bengal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Debidas", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Physiology and Department of Nutrition, Raja N L Khans Women's College, Midnapore, West Bengal, India. ; Dialysis Unit,Vidyasagar Institute of Health, West Bengal, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar Nandi", "ForeName": "Dilip", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101208407", "ISSNLinking": "1726-6882"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Moeller S, Gioberge S, Brown G.
