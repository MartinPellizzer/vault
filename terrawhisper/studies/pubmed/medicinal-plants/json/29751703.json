The characteristics of mineral elements in the plants and the soil of main distribution area of Ch. smyrnioides was analyzed and the mechanism of the quality formation of Ch. smyrnioides was explored to provide the basis for the quality evaluation and cultivation regulation of Ch. smyrnioides.The results showed that the quality of soil environment was better in the main distribution area of Ch. smyrnioides, the content of trace elements was higher, the contents of P and K were lower and the contents of mineral elements in the soil of each distribution area was significantly different. The three elements of Se, P and K are significantly accumulated in the root of Ch. smyrnioides. There were significant differences in the total contents of mineral elements in the roots of Ch. smyrnioides in different producing areas. The contents of mineral elements in different parts of Ch. smyrnioides were significantly different. Ch.smyrnioides of the main distribution area of Ch. smyrnioides belonged to the safety level, the distribution of mineral elements in the plants can be used as an indicator of the quality of medicinal herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials\uff0c Nanjing Agricultural University\uff0c Nanjing 210095\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-Lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials\uff0c Nanjing Agricultural University\uff0c Nanjing 210095\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials\uff0c Nanjing Agricultural University\uff0c Nanjing 210095\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Bo-Xing", "Initials": "BX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29751703", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180201.011"]}}]}
