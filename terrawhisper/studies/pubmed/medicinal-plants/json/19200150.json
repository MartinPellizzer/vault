The results showed that the primary and secondary structures of roots, and the structures of stems and leaves of A. bidentata, were similar to those of ordinary dicotyledonous plants. The enlargement of its roots, however, was primarily associated with growth and differentiation of tertiary structures. There were collateral medullary vascular bundles in addition to the normal vascular bundles in the stem. The tertiary structure was not only main parts in the roots of A. bidentata, but also important storage region of triterpenoid saponin in its growth and development. The stem may be the essential transport organ of triterpenoid saponin, while palisade parenchyma may be the primary synthesis location. In November, the total quantity of triterpenoid saponin and overall biomass in the roots reach a maximum level. This was the best time, therefore, to harvest the roots and corresponded to the traditional harvest period. Despite the withered appearance of leaves, stems also contained substantial amounts of triterpenoid saponin, and it was recommended that the stems of A. bidentata should be used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Resource Biology and Biotechnology in Western China, Ministry of Education, Northwest University, Xi'an 710069, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jinting", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Zhenghai", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "J Integr Plant Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101250502", "ISSNLinking": "1672-9072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Achyranthes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19200150", "10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00764.x", "JIPB764"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
