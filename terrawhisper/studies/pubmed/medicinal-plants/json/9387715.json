Results showed that: (1) Serum E2 and the E2/T ratio were lower (P < 0.01) in the group of Kidney-Yin Deficiency type and higher (P < 0.01) in the group of Kidney-Yang Deficiency type as compared with normal control. (2) After treatment with Lishen injection the levels of serum E2 and the E2/T ratio were elevated in the former (P < 0.01) and lowered in the later (P < 0.01). Both were approaching to normal level (P > 0.05). (3) The levels of T in both groups were unaffected (P > 0.05) before and after treatment. These results suggested the imbalance of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang is related to the disturbance of sex hormones and Lishen injection could not only regulate the Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang, improve the symptoms of Kidney Deficiency, but also could convert the abnormal change of sex hormone, it has a good diphasic regulatory effect on E2, and is beneficial on balance of sex hormones of both sex in the inner environment of human body."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "R X", "Initials": "RX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4TI98Z838E", "NameOfSubstance": "Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postmenopause"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Yang Deficiency"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Yin Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9387715"]}}]}
