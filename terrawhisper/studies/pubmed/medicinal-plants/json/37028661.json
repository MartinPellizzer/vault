Nanoparticles have tremendous applications in various sectors, including the areas of food and pharmaceutics. They are being prepared from multiple natural sources widely. Lignin is one such source that deserves special mention due to its ecological compatibility, accessibility, abundance, and low cost. This amorphous heterogeneous phenolic polymer is the second most abundant molecule in nature after cellulose. Apart from being used as a biofuel source, lignin is less explored for its potential at a nano-level. In plants, lignin exhibits cross-linking structures with cellulose and hemicellulose. Numerous advancements have taken place in synthesizing nanolignins for manufacturing lignin-based materials to benefit from the untapped potential of lignin in high-value-added applications. Lignin and lignin-based nanoparticles have numerous applications, but in this review, we are mainly focusing on the applications in the food and pharmaceutical sectors. The exercise we undertake has great relevance as it helps scientists and industries gain valuable insights into lignin's capabilities and exploit its physical and chemical properties to facilitate the development of future lignin-based materials. We have summarized the available lignin resources and their potential in the food and pharmaceutical industries at various levels. This review attempts to understand various methods adopted for the preparation of nanolignin. Furthermore, the unique properties of nano-lignin-based materials and their applications in fields including the packaging industry, emulsions, nutrient delivery, drug delivery hydrogels, tissue engineering, and biomedical applications were well-discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
