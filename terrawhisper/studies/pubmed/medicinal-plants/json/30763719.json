Compounds 7, 15, 16 were isolated from this genus for the first time. The planar structures of the new compounds were determined by extensive analysis of their NMR and HR-ESI-MS spectra, and the absolute configurations were established on the basis of specific rotation in association with calculated ECD spectra. Compounds 2, 6 and 18 showed significant antiproliferative effects against five human cancer cell lines (A549, MDA-MB-231, SK-Hep-1, SNU638, HCT116) with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.99\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.41\u202f\u03bcM to 15.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.17\u202f\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
