This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory effect of Portulaca oleracea leaf ethanolic extract (POE) on acetic acid (AA)-induced UC in mice. Experimental animals received oral doses of POE (200\u00a0mg/kg for 7 days) after an induction of colitis by intrarectal AA administration. In mice with AA-induced UC treated with POE, the results revealed a significant modulation in body weight and colon length. Moreover, treatment with POE downregulated the interleukin 1, 6, and 17, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, gamma interferon, and nuclear factor-kappa B levels compared with the colitis group. Furthermore, POE markedly inhibited histological damage, decreased myeloperoxidase activity and reduced fecal calprotectin level compared with the colitis group. These data are consistent with the reduction in total bacterial content in the colon. Taken together, treatment with POE may reduce colonic inflammation by alleviating the immune response and inhibiting the severity of colitis. The HPLC analysis of POE resulted in the identification of seven medicinal compounds comprising two phenolic acids (ferulic and caffeic acids) and five flavonoids (kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, narenginin and hesperidin). Subsequent analysis of POE by GC-MS revealed ten phytocomponents; the major percentages were hexadecenoic acid, methyl ester (29.8119%), \u03b1-linolenic acid (25.8431%), 16-octadecenoic acid, methyl ester (15.1578%) and \u03b1-tocopherol (10.7848%). Delta-lactams and alkanes were the minor components. Such natural plant-derived substances and their probable synergistic action appear to contribute to a promising therapeutic protocol for colitis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
