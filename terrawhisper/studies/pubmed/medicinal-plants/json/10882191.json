In the present study, we studied the effect of Lichtwer garlic powder (containing 1.3% alliin equivalent to 0.6% allicin) on the serum cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, protein, and systolic blood pressure in rats fed with a high cholesterol diet. Experimental rats were fed a 2% high cholesterol diet with and without garlic powder for 6 weeks. Control rats were fed a normal diet. The aqueous garlic powder extract was given orally to rats on a daily basis. It was observed that cholesterol-fed animals had a significant increase in serum cholesterol compared to the control group of rats fed on a normal diet. However, when the rats were fed with a high cholesterol diet mixed with garlic powder, there was a significant reduction in their serum cholesterol levels compared with the group which were on a diet containing high cholesterol without garlic powder. Serum triglyceride levels were also significantly lowered by garlic powder when compared to control and high cholesterol diet group rats. The blood pressure of the high cholesterol diet animals was significantly higher compared to the animals receiving the control diet. The blood pressure of the animals receiving garlic powder and high cholesterol diet was significantly lower as compared to the high cholesterol and control diet group. No significant changes were observed in the serum glucose and protein in all of the rats. These results show that garlic is beneficial in reducing blood cholesterol, triglycerides levels and systolic blood pressure in hypercholesterolemic rats. Our experimental results show that garlic may beneficially affect two risk factors for atherosclerosis--hyperlipidemia and hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Kuwait University, Safat. muslim@kuc01.kuniv.edu.kw"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al-Qattan", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Al-Enezi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khanafer", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Prostaglandins Leukot Essent Fatty Acids", "NlmUniqueID": "8802730", "ISSNLinking": "0952-3278"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10882191", "10.1054/plef.2000.0152", "S0952-3278(00)90152-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
