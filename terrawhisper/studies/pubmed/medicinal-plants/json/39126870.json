The designed compounds exhibited more balanced and effective multi-target potency. Among them, compound 11l, <sub>l</sub>-Valine carbamate derivative of scutellarein cycloheptylamine ether, exhibited the most potent inhibition of electric eel AChE enzymes and human AChE enzymes, with an IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.04\u00a0\u03bcM and 9.73 \u03bcM, respectively. Moreover, 11l exhibited more potent H<sub>3</sub>R antagonistic activities than clobenpropit, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.09\u00a0nM. Compound 11l not only displayed excellent inhibition of self- and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation (95.48\u00a0% and 88.63\u00a0% inhibition, respectively) but also induced the disassembly of self- and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2 fibrils (80.16\u00a0% and 89.30\u00a0% disaggregation, respectively). Moreover, 11l significantly reduced tau protein hyperphosphorylation induced by A\u03b2<sub>25-35</sub>. It exhibited effective antioxidant activity and neuroprotective potency, and inhibited RSL3-induced PC12 cell ferroptosis. Assays of hCMEC/D3 and hPepT1-MDCK cell line permeability indicated that 11l would have optimal blood-brain barrier permeability and intestinal absorption characteristics. In addition, in vivo studies revealed that compound 11l significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in an AD mouse model. Finally, a pharmacokinetic characterization of 11l indicated favorable druggability and pharmacokinetic properties. Taken together, our results suggest that 11l is a potential candidate for AD treatment and merits further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
