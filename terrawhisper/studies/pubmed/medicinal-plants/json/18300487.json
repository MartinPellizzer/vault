The results showed that the gentiopicrin contents in the plants growing for three years were slightly higher than those of two years, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). The average gentiopicrin contents in roots, stems and leaves were 13.30%, 2.95% and 2.24% respectively. Within the same growing year, gentiopicrin contents were decreased in stems and leaves but increased in roots with the harvest delay. The gentiopicrin contents also varied with lower to high altilude were 10.23%, 13.12% and 15.54% in Longxi, Kangle and Lintan county respectively. All these results indicated that the gentiopicrin contents in roots, stems and leaves of cultivated G. straminea were all conformable to the Codex criterion (2%). Considering both gentiopicrin yield and production cost, the biennial roots should be taken and harvested after October before soil frozen. However, the harvest should be predated by the end of August or the beginning of September only for stems and leaves. It is benefit for gentiopicrin accumulation in G. straminea when cultivated in high-altitude areas."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agronomy College, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou 730070, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Dai-yu", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Feng-xia", "Initials": "FX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "En-jun", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fu-zhi", "Initials": "FZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Gentiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18300487"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
