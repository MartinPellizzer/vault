Hyaluronic acid (HA) based Glycyrrhizin (GL) and Methotrexate (MT) loaded localized delivery systems, specifically nanofiber (NF) based platforms, were developed to address these challenges. The electrospinning method was used for the successful fabrication of a homogenous NF membrane and characterized for morphology, drug entrapment efficiency, tensile strength, and ex-vivo mucoadhesive study. Also, it was evaluated for in-vitro drug release profile, ex-vivo drug permeability, in-vitro anti-inflammatory, apoptosis assay by MTT and flow, and against specific cell lines in order to determine their potential for therapeutic use. Superior tensile breaking force (50 g), mucoadhesive strength of 153 gm/cm<sup>2</sup>, drug permeability, and releasing properties of designed NF, making them perfect requirements for oral cavity delivery. The anticancer potential of MT in the MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis was significantly increased in oral epidermal carcinoma cell (KB cell) for drug-loaded NF with 63.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.99\u00a0% apoptosis, at 24\u00a0h. With these incorporated, GL with MT in NF had an anti-inflammatory potential, also demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo. In the Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) induced mice model, the optimal formulation's shows better potential for tumor regression when comparing the developed NF formulation to the drugs. Experimental results show that by lowering mucositis-related inflammation and enhancing the effectiveness of oral cancer treatment, a developed nanofiber-based local drug delivery system offers a feasible strategy for managing oral cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
