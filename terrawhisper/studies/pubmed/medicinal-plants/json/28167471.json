Hyperglycemia results in diabetic complication due to a reaction between sugar and amino acid of proteins to form advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in different tissues. Medicinal plants are considered as a great source of bioactive compounds that affect many ailments. In this regard; AGEs formation could be inhibited by many bioactive compounds isolated from medicinal plants. Viscum schimperi Engl. is a plant belongs to Loranthaceae and known for its antidiabetic activity. In this study; total methanol extract of V. schimperi (VT) was prepared, suspended in water and subjected to fractionation with chloroform followed by n-butanol to give (VC) and (VB) fractions respectively. The aqueous mother liquor was evaporated to form (VA) fraction. The inhibitory effect of all prepared fraction on the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) was studied. The results revealed that V. schimperi extract and its different fractions inhibited protein glycation and oxidation of BSA induced by ribose together with decrease of protein aggregation. In conclusion; V. schimperi will be useful in management of diabetic complications based on its inhibition of advanced glycation endproduct formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia / Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "Hossam Mohamed", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "ALGhamdi", "ForeName": "Doha Omar", "Initials": "DO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Salem", "ForeName": "Maab Siddiq", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alattas", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "El-Bassossy", "ForeName": "Hany Mohamed", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alahdal", "ForeName": "Abdulrahman Mohammed", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shehata", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Ateya", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Sattar", "ForeName": "Essam", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Aggregates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "advanced glycation end products-bovine serum albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27432CM55Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V31YC746X", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroform"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8PJ61P6TS3", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Butanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "1-Butanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroform"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Aggregates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Viscum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28167471"]}}]}
