It was however reported that the heart rate was unchanged during tetrandrine-induced hypotension. The possibility of different tissue sensitivity to various concentrations of tetrandrine was therefore investigated using the rat isolated aorta and atria. It was found that tetrandrine (1 x 10(-5) M) was sufficient to suppress more than 90% of the aortic contraction induced by norepinephrine (1 x 10(-8) M) or KCl (50 mM). However, only 10% of the initial heart rate was suppressed by 1 x 10(-5) M tetrandrine. It was therefore concluded that the aorta and atria might have different sensitivity to tetrandrine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Letter"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "29EX23D5AJ", "NameOfSubstance": "tetrandrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzylisoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Atria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9810276", "10.1055/s-2006-957546"]}}]}
