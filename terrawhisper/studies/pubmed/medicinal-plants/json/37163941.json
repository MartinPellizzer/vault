Ginseng products derived from the multiple parts (e.g., root/rhizome, leaf, and flower bud) of multiple Panax species (P. ginseng, P. quinquefolius, P. notoginseng, P. japonicus, and P. japonicus var. major) are globally popular; however, their authentication is very challenging. Using online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LC), we propose the concept of a three-dimensional characteristic chromatogram (3D CC) by integrating enhanced LC\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LC separation and a contour plot that visualizes the stereoscopic chromatographic peaks and examine its performance in authenticating various ginseng products. Targeted at the resolution of 17 ginsenoside markers, an online LC\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0LC/UV system with a 56\u00a0min analysis time was constructed: a CORTECS UPLC Shield RP 18 column running at 0.1\u00a0mL/min for the first-dimensional chromatography and a Poroshell SB-Aq column at 2.0\u00a0mL/min in shift gradient mode in the second dimension of separation. In particular, ginsenosides Rg1/Re and Rc/Ra1 were well resolved. According to the presence/absence of stereo peaks consistent with the main ginsenoside markers in the 3D CC and the depth of shade (depending on peak volume), it was feasible to use a single method to identify and distinguish among 12 different ginseng species as the drug materials and the use of ginseng simultaneously from 21 CPMs. Conclusively, a practical solution enabling the accurate identification of easily confused TCMs was provided, covering both the drug materials and the compound preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
