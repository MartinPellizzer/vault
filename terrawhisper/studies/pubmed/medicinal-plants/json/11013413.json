The alkaline unwinding/neutral electrophoresis (A/N) and alkaline unwinding/alkaline electrophoresis (A/A) protocols were used for detection of DNA damage. With the A/N comet assay, less DNA damage was seen after conditioning pretreatment with a low dose prior to a high challenging dose of alkylating mutagens as compared to application of the high dose only, whereas a nearly additive effect was seen when the A/A comet assay was used. Adaptation was even more obvious when AP sites were revealed by the AP-endonuclease activity of exonuclease III. The adaptation observed with the A/N comet assay was abolished by pretreatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These data suggest that the comet assay is able to detect on molecular level a phenomenon resembling clastogenic adaptation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Experimental Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Praha, Czech Republic. angelis@ueb.cas.cz"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Angelis", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McGuffie", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menke", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schubert", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mesylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12EH9M7279", "NameOfSubstance": "methanesulfonic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkylating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mesylates"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11013413", "10.1002/1098-2280(2000)36:2<146::aid-em9>3.0.co;2-5", "10.1002/1098-2280(2000)36:2<146::AID-EM9>3.0.CO;2-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
