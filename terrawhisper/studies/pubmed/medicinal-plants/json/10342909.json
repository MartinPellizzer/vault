In oriental countries, some medicinal plants have been claimed for uses to improve circulation, induce fibrinolysis or prevent thrombosis. In cooperation with chemists using bioassay-based step-by-step purification, some antiplatelet agents were isolated from plant sources. According to their effects on platelet aggregation, release reaction and signal transductions involved, these antiplatelet agents can be classified into eight groups: 1. platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists, 2. collagen-receptor antagonists, 3. thromboxane-receptor antagonists, 4. ADP-receptor agonists, 5. inhibitors of phosphoinositide breakdown, 6. inhibitors of thromboxane formation, 7. agents increasing cyclic nucleotides, and 8. protein kinase C activators. These new pharmacological agents derived from medicinal plant sources may be useful as leads to develop as effective cardiovascular drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9437512", "ISSNLinking": "1078-0297"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "68"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10342909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
