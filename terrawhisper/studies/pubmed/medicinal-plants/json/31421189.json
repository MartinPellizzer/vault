APETALA2/Ethylene-Responsive factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor (TF) is one of the largest gene families in plants that play a fundamental role in growth and development as well as biotic and/or abiotic stresses responses. Although AP2/ERFs have been extensively characterized in many plant species, little is known about this family in radish, which is an important root vegetable with various medicinal properties. The available genome provides valuable opportunity to identify and characterize the global information on AP2/ERF TFs in radish. In this study, a total of 247 ERF family genes were identified from the radish genome, and sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses classified the AP2/ERF superfamily into five groups (AP2, ERF, DREB, RAV and soloist). Motif analysis showed that other than AP2/ERF domains, other conserved regions were selectively distributed among different clades in the phylogenetic tree. Chromosome location analysis showed that tandem duplication may result in the expansion of RsAP2/ERF gene family. The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that a proportion of AP2/ERF genes were preferably expressed under drought and heat stresses, whereas they were suppressed under the ABA and heavy metal stresses. These results provided valuable information for further evolutionary and functional characterization of RsAP2/ERF genes, and contributed to genetic improvement of stress tolerances in radish and other root vegetable crops."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
