The sequence comparisons showed that BYMV and C1YVV were distinct viruses but had close affinity to each other (85-95% homology among isolates of a virus but 70-77% homology between viruses), justifying establishment of the BYMV subgroup. There was an oligonucleotide consensus sequence present in the 3' terminal non-coding region of all potyviruses examined. This consensus sequence divided the potyviruses into three groups whose significance is not clear."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Uyeda", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "9214275", "ISSNLinking": "0939-1983"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Introns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1450764", "10.1007/978-3-7091-6920-9_40"]}}]}
