Flavonols and flavones are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds that are commonly consumed in the diet. Epidemiological studies indicating that high dietary intake of flavonols reduces the risk of mortality due to coronary heart disease have provoked interest in the mechanism of this cardioprotective effect. 2. We have investigated the structure-activity relationships of a range of flavonols and flavones with regard to their vascular relaxant and anti-oxidant activity. In rat isolated thoracic aorta, the synthetic flavonol 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF) was found to be a significantly more potent vasorelaxant than the naturally occurring compounds chrysin, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and fisetin. Similarly, DiOHF was significantly more potent than those compounds in the inhibition of calcium-induced contraction of the rat aorta. 3. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was also found to significantly inhibit superoxide radical generation in a cell-free system in the presence of xanthine/xanthine oxidase or by rat isolated aorta in the presence of NADPH. In the presence of oxidant stress generated by pyrogallol or xanthine/xanthine oxidase, endothelium-dependent relaxation of rat aortic rings was impaired. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was able to significantly improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of those oxygen radical generators. 4. In addition, DiOHF was found to significantly improve dilatation in the rat hindquarters vasculature after exposure to ischaemia and reperfusion. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol was found to be equally effective whether applied before ischaemia or during ischaemia just before reperfusion. 5. In conclusion, DiOHF is an effective vasodilator and anti-oxidant that is able to prevent vascular reperfusion injury. We suggest that DiOHF may be useful as an adjunct to thrombolytic therapy in the management of reperfusion injury."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia. owenlw@unimelb.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woodman", "ForeName": "Owen L", "Initials": "OL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Elsa Ch", "Initials": "ECh"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0425076", "ISSNLinking": "0305-1870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Relaxation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}], "NumberOfReferences": "34"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15566394", "10.1111/j.1440-1681.2004.04072.x", "CEP4072"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
