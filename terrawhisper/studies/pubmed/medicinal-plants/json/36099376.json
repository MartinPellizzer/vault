Screening small molecules against specific bacterial targets has not yielded new compounds therefore functional assays and phenotypic screens are now being used. In Nigeria, drug resistance towards Salmonella is a major public health concern.", "Nine fully characterized clinical Salmonella isolates, from the Department of Medical Microbiology, Jos University Teaching Hospital, Plateau State, Nigeria, were screened by broth microdilution for susceptibility to fractionated ethanol extracts of Vitex doniana and Abutilon hirtum. This was compared to the control organism ATCC25922 and a range antibiotics: CH (chloramphenicol), SP (sparfloxacin), AM (amoxicillin), CN (gentamicin), S (streptomycin), PEF (pefloxacin).", "The most common resistance profile was AM,CN,S with most isolates susceptible to fluoroquinolones. Activity was detected from both plant extracts with MICs of extracted fractions ranging from 150 - 300 \u00b5g/mL. Interestingly both plants produced extracts with bactericidal activity from 300 - 600 \u00b5g/mL. V. doniana exhibited better activity against the resistant Salmonella strains in terms of greater inhibition zones, but A. hirtum extracts were more consistently active against all isolates. In comparison with the synthetic drugs, both plant extracts exhibited activity against more isolates - this activity was bactericidal.", "Nigeria needs better anti-salmonella products and these results represent a starting point for antibiotic drug discovery."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2022 Dawang Noel, John Wain, Patricia Lar."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science and Technology, Plateau State Polytechnic, Barkin, Ladi, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Noel", "ForeName": "Dawang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quadram Institute and University of East Anglia, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Wain", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, University of Jos, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Lar", "ForeName": "Patricia", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "BB/R012504/1", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}, {"GrantID": "BBS/E/F/000PR10349", "Acronym": "BB_", "Agency": "Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council", "Country": "United Kingdom"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Infect Dev Ctries", "NlmUniqueID": "101305410", "ISSNLinking": "1972-2680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Florida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prunus domestica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitex"}], "CoiStatement": "No Conflict of Interest is declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36099376", "10.3855/jidc.14216"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
