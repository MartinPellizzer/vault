Seven PqU6 promo-ter sequences were cloned from the gDNA of Panax quinquefolium, and the transcriptional activation ability of the seven promoters was studied. In this study, seven PqU6 promoter sequences with a length of about 1 300 bp were cloned from the adventitious roots of P. quinquefolium cultivated for 5 weeks. Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the sequence characteristics of PqU6 promoters, and the fusion expression vectors of GUS gene driven by PqU6-P were constructed. Tobacco leaves were transformed by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated method for activity detection. The seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end to reach 283, 287, 279, 289, 295, 289, and 283 bp, respectively. The vectors for detection of promoter activity were constructed with GUS as a reported gene and used to transform P. quinquefolium callus and tobacco leaves. The results showed that seven PqU6 promoter sequences(PqU6-1P to PqU6-7P) were cloned from the gDNA of P. quinquefolium, with the length ranged from 1 246 bp to 1 308 bp. Sequence comparison results showed that the seven PqU6 promoter sequences and the AtU6-P promoter all had USE and TATA boxes, which are essential elements affecting the transcriptional activity of the U6 promoter. The results of GUS staining and enzyme activity test showed that all the seven PqU6 promoters had transcriptional activity. The PqU6-7P with a length of 1 269 bp had the highest transcriptional activity, 1.31 times that of the positive control P-35S. When the seven PqU6 promoters were truncated from the 5'-end(PqU6-1PA to PqU6-7PA), their transcriptional activities were different in tobacco leaves and P. quinquefolium callus. The transcriptional activity of PqU6-7PA promoter(283 bp) was 1.59 times that of AtU6-P promoter(292 bp) when the recipient material was P. quinquefolium callus. The findings provide more ideal endogenous U6 promoters for CRISPR/Cas9 technology in ginseng and other medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China Central Mindanao University College of Arts and Sciences Musuan 8710, Philippines."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing-Xian", "Initials": "JX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guo-Xia", "Initials": "GX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun-Ge", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Fang-Yi", "Initials": "FY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chen-Ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science, Zhengzhou Normal University Zhengzhou 450000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yao-Guang", "Initials": "YG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37381953", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230213.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
