Products of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) could greatly expand European consumer options; however, only seven herbal medicinal products (HMPs) based on CHM formulae have been registered in the European Union (EU) since 2012.", "This study reviews the ten-year registration status of HMPs based on CHM formulae in Europe and identifies major challenges and possible solutions for pharmaceutical companies seeking market access for new HMPs.", "An overview of relevant EU regulations identifies pathways to market access in EU countries for CHM products. A discussion of successful attempts to register HMPs based on CHM formulae since 2012 highlights specific challenges that applicants can expect to face.", "CHM products can enter the EU market as HMPs through the full or well-established use marketing authorization, or through the simplified registration procedure. Alternatively, some CHM products have entered the market as dietary supplements, nutritional foods, and agricultural products; however, under these categories, claims for medicinal use cannot be advertised. Since the registration of the first CHM product, Diao Xin Xue Kang (with the single component of Dioscorea nipponica rhizome), in 2012, only six other HMPs based on CHM formulae have been successfully registered. Among these, four are mono-component products. The remaining two products contain combinations of several herbal ingredients. It is more difficult to register combination products than mono-component products, due to their more complex composition and differences in registration requirements (esp. concerning establishing indications) in China and Europe.", "To promote the successful registration of CHM products in Europe, pharmaceutical companies are advised to: demonstrate full control of, and the ability to test, their supply chain and manufacturing procedures following the guidance of European competent authorities; carefully adhere to all steps of the registration process and advices from European competent authorities; take the medication habits and pharmaceutical needs of European market into consideration; and establish collaboration with European local organizations, as appropriate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
