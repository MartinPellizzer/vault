Geraniol and geranyl acetate together constituted about 90% of the palmarosa oil. The proportion of geranyl acetate in the oil decreased significantly with a corresponding increase of geraniol, during inflorescence development. An esterase enzyme activity, involved in the transformation of geranyl acetate to geraniol, was detected from the immature inflorescence using a gas chromatographic procedure. The enzyme, termed as geranyl acetate cleaving esterase (GAE), was found to be active in the alkaline pH range with the optimum at pH 8.5. The catalysis of geranyl acetate was linear up to 6 h, and after 24 h of incubation, 75% of the geranyl acetate incubated was hydrolyzed. The GAE enzymic preparation, when stored at 4 degrees C for a week, was quite stable with only 40% loss of activity. The physiological role of GAE in the production of geraniol during palmarosa inflorescence development has been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015 (U.P.), India"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "V S", "Initials": "VS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luthra", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3W81YG7P9R", "NameOfSubstance": "geranyl acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L837108USY", "NameOfSubstance": "geraniol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11397433", "10.1016/s0031-9422(01)00122-4", "S0031-9422(01)00122-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
