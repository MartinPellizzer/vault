Apart from agricultural benefits, OPs also impose adverse toxicological effects on animal and human population. Conventional approaches such as chromatographic techniques used for pesticide detection are associated with several limitations. A biosensor technology is unique due to the detection sensitivity, selectivity, remarkable performance capabilities, simplicity and on-site operation, fabrication and incorporation with nanomaterials. This study also provided specifications of the most OPs biosensors reported until today based on their transducer system. In addition, we highlighted the application of advanced complementary materials and analysis techniques in OPs detection systems. The availability of these new materials associated with new sensing techniques has led to introduction of easy-to-use analytical tools of high sensitivity and specificity in the design and construction of OPs biosensors. In this review, we elaborated the achievements in sensing systems concerning innovative nanomaterials and analytical techniques with emphasis on OPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, 1417614411, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Interest Group, Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hassani", "ForeName": "Shokoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, 1417614411, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Interest Group, Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtaz", "ForeName": "Saeideh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Centre, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vakhshiteh", "ForeName": "Faezeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, 1417614411, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Interest Group, Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Maghsoudi", "ForeName": "Armin Salek", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ganjali", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Excellence in Electrochemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Norouzi", "ForeName": "Parviz", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0123-1209"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Science, Tehran, 1417614411, Iran.
