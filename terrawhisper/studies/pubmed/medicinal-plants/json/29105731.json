Hairy root culture is an ideal platform for alkaloids production due to its industrial scalability, genetic and chemical stability, and availability of genetic engineering tools. However, C. roseus hairy roots do not produce vindoline due to the lack of expression of the seven-step pathway from tabersonine to vindoline [Murata & De Luca (2015) Plant Journal, 44, 581-594]. The present study describes the genetic engineering of the first two genes tabersonine 16-hydroxylase (T16H) and 16-O-methyl transferase (16OMT) in the missing vindoline pathway under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter to direct tabersonine toward vindoline biosynthesis in C. roseus hairy roots. In two transgenic hairy roots, the induced overexpression of T16H and 16OMT resulted in the accumulation of vindoline pathway metabolites 16-hydroxytabersonine and 16-methoxytabersonine. The levels of root-specific alkaloids, including lochnericine, 19-hydroxytabersonine and h\u00f6rhammericine, significantly decreased in the induced hairy roots in comparison to the uninduced control lines. This suggests tabersonine was successfully channeled to the vindoline pathway away from the roots competing pathway based on the overexpression. Interestingly, another two new metabolites were detected in the induced hairy roots and proposed to be the epoxidized-16-hydroxytabersonine and lochnerinine. Thus, the introduction of vindoline pathway genes in hairy roots can cause unexpected terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIA) profile alterations. Furthermore, we observed complex transcriptional changes in TIA genes and regulators detected by RT-qPCR which highlight the tight regulation of the TIA pathway in response to T16H and 16OMT engineering in C. roseus hairy roots."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jiayi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, Ames, Iowa."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6817-8006"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, Ames, Iowa."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Zengyi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical and Biological Engineering, Iowa State University, Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, Ames, Iowa."}], "LastName": "Shanks", "ForeName": "Jacqueline", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1263-8859"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado."}], "LastName": "Peebles", "ForeName": "Christie A M", "Initials": "CAM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Bioeng", "NlmUniqueID": "7502021", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4429-63-4", "NameOfSubstance": "tabersonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.103", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP71D12 protein, Catharanthus roseus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indole Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29105731", "10.1002/bit.26487"]}}]}
