The HPLC fingerprints of both the standard Fructus gardeniae and the ten batches of Fructus gardeniae produced in different places were evaluated by the new parameters to obtain good results. The contrasted fingerprint contained 35 peaks while geniposide was selected as the reference peak. The HPLC fingerprint had good precision and reproducibility with the RSD of the relative retention time less than 1.5% and the RSD of the relative peak area within 5%. The qualitative similarity and quantitative similarity between each crude drug and the contrasted fingerprint were quantitatively calculated, the values of C%, P%, etc., were applied in the quality control practice, which had less errors. What is more, this method could be used for the overall quality control of Fructus gardeniae and especially suits for qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the chromatographic fingerprints both in chemical constituent distribution and in contents. The quantitative parameters such as C% and P% can be used to objectively, authentically and thoroughly display the content information characteristics. When they combined with the qualitative similarity, it will be the good method to evaluate the chromatographic fingerprints of traditional Chinese medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China. gxswmwys@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Guo-Xiang", "Initials": "GX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Zhi-Fei", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-Ling", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Kai-Shun", "Initials": "KS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Yu-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gardenia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17520812"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
