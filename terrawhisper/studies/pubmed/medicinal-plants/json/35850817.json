extract and clarify the dynamic changes and distribution characteristics of the compounds in vivo.UPLC-MS/MS was used for simultaneous determination of 3-deoxysappanchalcone, isoliquiritigenin, protosappanin B, and protosappanin B-10-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside in plasma, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach and duodenum of rats, to further study the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of root bark of C.decapetala extract in rats.Statistical analysis of obtained data demonstrated that the established analytical methods of the four components in biological matrix met the requirements of biological sample determination.The pharmacokinetic parameters showed that the t_(1/2 z), T_(max), C_(max), AUC_(0-t), MRT_(0-t), and CL_(z/F) of each component were 4.57-13.47 h, 0.22-0.51 h, 27.60-6 418.38 \u03bcg\u00b7L~(-1), 112.45-11 824.25 h\u00b7\u03bcg\u00b7L~(-1), 3.89-9.01 h, and 9.85-96.87 L\u00b7h~(-1)\u00b7kg~(-1), respectively.The results of tissue distribution revealed that at different time points, the components were widely but unevenly distributed in the body.Specifically, they were more distributed in the stomach and duodenum, followed by liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, and the least distribution was observed in the heart."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and
