Trans-artepillin A was obtained from this plant for the first time. The structures of the isolates were proposed by analysis of their 1D, 2D-NMR and HRESIMS spectroscopic data. Their absolute configurations were determined by comparison of their experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. Evaluations of the anti-inflammatory activity revealed that (-)-scopacoumaricin D, (+)-scopacoumaricin F and cis-scopacoumaricin G showed moderate anti-inflammatory activity on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in RAW264.7\u00a0cell."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
