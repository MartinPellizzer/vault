Using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a model pro-oxidant to induce oxidative stress, we have examined the ability of natural food supplement Maharishi Amrit Kalash (MAK-4) to decrease oxidative damage in potassium-arrested isolated rat hearts. The protocol was that hearts isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were retrograde-perfused with Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) solution for 30 min for equilibration. After this period, the hearts were subjected to cardioplegia with high potassium (26-30 mM), followed by reperfusion with K-H solution in the presence or absence of 200 microM H2O2. As expected, H2O2 treatment following cardioplegia induced a high degree of oxidative stress as assessed by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, a marker of plasma membrane damage) and total glutathione (GSH + GSSG). H2O2 also impaired the ability of heart to regain developed tension during the testing period. However, addition of MAK-4 in the perfusate containing H2O2 decreased oxidative stress in terms of release of LDH and glutathione. In parallel with these biochemical studies, in a few experiments the cardiac function was assessed by measuring developed contractile tension. These preliminary studies also showed that in the presence of MAK-4 the H2O2-treated hearts were able to regain better developed tension. Further in vitro studies to examine the possible mechanisms of MAK-4 action reveal that this formulation contains H2O2 binding activity which resulted in the decreased availability of H2O2 itself. Our studies hence reveal that the ayurvedic food supplement MAK-4 may have potential benefits in reducing oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA."}], "LastName": "Cullen", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dulchavsky", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Devasagayam", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Venkataraman", "ForeName": "B V", "Initials": "BV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perfusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9201611", "10.1016/s0378-8741(97)01526-2", "S0378-8741(97)01526-2"]}}]}
