Thus far, only a few studies have focused on the use of chitin as a source of high-protein-diet oligosaccharides. The use of insect chitin for the production of high-protein-diet oligosaccharides can lessen the reliance on diet crops. Moreover, although chitin composition in Tenebrio molitor larva, pupa, and adult has been extensively investigated, chitin extraction from T. molitor larval whole body and exuvium has received poor attention. The present study compared the effectiveness of two techniques for extracting high-protein-diet chitin oligosaccharide from an edible insect (T. molitor). Two different extraction sequences of chitin from the larval stage (molitor stage larvae) and adult stage (molitor stage adult) of edible T. molitor were investigated. Two processing steps were employed: (a) deproteinization (DEP) and (b) demineralization (DEM) treatments. Differences in the order, conditions, and period of their application resulted in two different chitin extraction procedures. The viscosity, degree of polymerization, and crystallinity index of the chitin extracted using the two procedures were measured, and its chemical components (chitin, ash, protein, fat, and moisture contents) were determined. T. molitor adults and larvae treated sequentially with DEM-DEP demonstrated the greatest yield of approximately 14.62\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15 and 6.096\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0%, respectively. By contrast, when treated sequentially with DEP-DEM, the recorded yields were 10.96\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 and 5.31\u00a0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38, respectively. Differences in the degree of deacetylation between both methods were observed. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry of the extracted chitin along with a commercial sample revealed consistent chain conformation, mean hydrogen bonding, and crystallinity index. In this way, residues produced by farmed edible insects can be recovered and used as a novel source of chitin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
