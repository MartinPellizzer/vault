In the present study the chronic effect of l-NAME (NOS inhibitor) on morphine-induced antinociception in male and female rats was investigated. Forty rats were divided into four groups: (1) female (2) female-LN (3) male (4) and male-LN. The animals of groups 2 and 4 received daily injection of l-NAME (10mg/kg) during 3 weeks. The animals of control groups 1 and 3 received 2ml/kg saline instead of l-NAME. Finally, all animals were tested on the hot plate test (52\u00b10.2\u00b0C; Cut-off 80s) to evaluate the antinociceptive effects of morphine. The hot plate test was performed for base record 15min before the injection of morphine (10mg/kg; s.c.) and consequently it was repeated every 15min after the injection. There were no significant differences in baseline latencies among all groups. Reaction times after injection of morphine in female-LN were higher than in the female control group (p<0.01). There was, however, no significant difference between male control and male-LN groups. Reaction times in the female-LN group were significantly higher than in the male-LN group. Reaction times after injection of morphine in the male group was longer than in the female group (p<0.01). It is concluded that sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen have a role in pain perception and analgesia. NO has a modulatory effects on functions of sex hormones in pain perception and analgesic effects of opioids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
