In this study, we evaluated potential pharmacological effects of ethanolic extracts of Z. Officinale with respect to central nervous system (CNS) activity in mice. Role of ethanolic extract of ginger on CNS activity in mice was studied using models of elevated plus maze test, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, tail suspension test, hot-plate and tail-flick test. Ginger extract was administered to mice at single doses of 50 and 200 mg/kg, perorally while diazepam (1 mg/kg), morphine (5 mg/kg) and imipramine (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally were used as standard drugs. The results showed that the ginger extract at all dose levels significantly exhibited anxiolytic activityincreased the sleeping latency but reduced the sleeping time. Tail suspension test showed that the extract at both the doses was able to induce a significant decrease in the immobility time, similar to imipramine, a recognized antidepressant drug. Tail-flick and hot-plate tests demonstrated antinociceptive property of ginger extract, similar to morphine, a recognized antinociceptive agent. Higher dose level (200 mg/kg) showed better protective effects. Phytochemical screening of ethanolic extract revealed the presence of various phytoconstituents such as phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, anthocyanins, carbohydrates, glycosides, proteins, resins and volatile oils. The possible mechanism by which ginger exhibited the significant beneficial effects on various CNS models in mice could be attributed to its antioxidant potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Pradeep Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Vijender", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sokindra", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nociception"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reaction Time"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30084567"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
