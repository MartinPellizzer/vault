The saponins escin Ia, escin Ib, isoescin Ia and isoescin Ib were extracted from seeds of A. chinesis Bunge via ASE, and the operational parameters of ASE were optimized, such as extraction solvent, extraction temperature, static extraction time and extraction cycles. The optimized procedure employed 70% MeOH as extraction solvent, 120 degrees C of extraction temperature, 7 min of static extraction time, 60% flush volume and the extraction recoveries of the four compounds were nearly to 100% for two cycles. The HPLC conditions are as follows: SinoChrom ODS BP C18 (4.6 mm x 200 mm, 5 microm) column, acetonitrile and 0.10% phosphoric acid solution as mobile phase, flow rate is 1.0 mL min(-1), detection length of UV is 203 nm, injection volume is 10 microL. The results indicated that the developed HPLC method is simple, sensitive and reliable for the determination of four major saponins in seeds of A. chinesis Bunge with a good linearity (r2 > 0.9994), precision (relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) < 1.5%) and the recovery ranges of 95.2-97.3%. The limits of detection (LOD) of the four compounds were in the range of 0.40-0.75 microg mL(-1). This assay can be readily utilized as a quality control method for semen aesculi and other related medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "QingDao Key Lab on Analytical Technology Development and Standardization of Chinese Medicines, First Institute Oceanography of SOA, Qingdao 266061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Junhui", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wenlong", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Baijuan", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiuchun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Frank Sen-Chun", "Initials": "FS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaoru", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aesculus"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17631106", "10.1016/j.aca.2007.06.011", "S0003-2670(07)01017-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
