Although they may possess theoretical advantages over benzodiazepines based on their unique pharmacologic profiles, they offer few, if any, significant advantages in terms of adverse effects. Over-the-counter agents such as valerian and melatonin may be useful in alleviating mild, short-term insomnia, but further clinical trials are required to fully evaluate their safety and efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Rutgers State University of New Jersey, Piscataway 08854, USA."}], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hening", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Pharmacother", "NlmUniqueID": "9203131", "ISSNLinking": "1060-0280"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azabicyclo Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrimidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03A5ORL08Q", "NameOfSubstance": "zopiclone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12794-10-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzodiazepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7K383OQI23", "NameOfSubstance": "Zolpidem"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JL5DK93RCL", "NameOfSubstance": "Melatonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S62U433RMH", "NameOfSubstance": "zaleplon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Acetamides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azabicyclo Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzodiazepines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Protocols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypnotics and Sedatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Melatonin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Piperazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrimidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zolpidem"}], "NumberOfReferences": "118"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9640488", "10.1345/aph.17111"]}}]}
