Regarding the morphological similarities among <i>Phyllanthus</i> species, we were attracted to evaluate the chondroprotective potential of <i>Phyllanthus</i> species including <i>P. amarus</i> obtained from Chiang Mai and Phuket, <i>Phyllanthus urinaria</i> L., <i>Phyllanthus urinaria</i> subsp<i>. chamaepeuce, Phyllanthus debilis</i>, and <i>Phyllanthus airy-shawii</i> using interleukin-1<i>\u03b2</i>-induced degradation of cartilage explants. The ethanolic extracts of the plants were evaluated for major lignans, phyllanthin, and hypophyllanthin by HPLC and further measurements of the total contents of flavonoids and phenolic compounds along with the assays for antioxidant and anti-collagenase activities. The interleukin-1<i>\u03b2</i>-induced cartilage explant degradation was performed with/without the extracts at concentrations of 50-250\u2009\u00b5g/mL. After 4-14 days of incubation, the medium was assayed for the level of sulfated glycosaminoglycans while the explants were measured for the remaining content of uronic acid. Proteoglycan intensity in the explants was determined by safranin O staining. Diacerein, the antiarthritic agent, was used as the positive control. Although the two major lignans were found in <i>P. amarus</i> from Chiang Mai, <i>P. amarus</i> from Phuket, and <i>P. urinaria</i> L. extracts, similar chondroprotective activities were observed in all <i>Phyllanthus</i> extracts. Total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the extracts showed a correlation with antioxidation, whereas the total phenolic content correlated with anti-collagenase activity. Among the six extracts, <i>P. airy-shawii</i> showed the greatest antioxidant and collagenase inhibitory activities. The results revealed that chondroprotective activities of all of the extracts of <i>Phyllanthus</i> species might result from an additive or synergistic influence of some constituents of these plants, which could be considered for antiarthritic purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Buddhachat", "ForeName": "Kittisak", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Chomdej", "ForeName": "Siriwadee", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science and Technology Research Institute, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Pradit", "ForeName": "Waranee", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Biosciences and Public Health, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Nganvongpanit", "ForeName": "Korakot", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thailand Excellence Center for Tissue Engineering and Stem Cells, Department of Biochemistry and the Center of Excellence for Innovation in Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Ongchai", "ForeName": "Siriwan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22ZZ21E33P", "NameOfSubstance": "hypophyllanthin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "75O1TFF47Z", "NameOfSubstance": "phyllanthin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagenases"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Planta Med. 2017 Jan;83(1-02):E1. doi: 10.1055/s-0035-1568860", "PMID": "27392241"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cartilage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27340791", "10.1055/s-0042-110097"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
