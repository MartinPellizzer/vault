The results demonstrated that compared with salt stress alone, foliar application of ZnO QDs significantly improved the biomass as well as the total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents under salt stress. ZnO QDs reduced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and MDA levels, decreased non-enzymatic antioxidant (ASA and GSH) content, and improved antioxidant enzyme (POD, SOD, CAT, PAL, and PPO) activity under salt stress. Metal elemental analysis further demonstrated that the ZnO QDs markedly increased Zn and K contents while decreasing Na content, resulting in a lower Na/K ratio compared to salt stress alone. Finally, RNA sequencing results indicated that ZnO QDs primarily regulated genes associated with stress-responsive pathways, including plant hormone signal transduction, the MAPK signaling pathway, and metabolic-related pathways, thereby alleviating the adverse effects of salt stress. In comparison, ZnO NPs did not exhibit similar effects in terms of improving plant growth, enhancing the antioxidant system, or regulating stress-responsive genes under salt stress. These findings highlight the distinct advantages of ZnO QDs and suggest their potential as a valuable tool for mitigating salt stress in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
