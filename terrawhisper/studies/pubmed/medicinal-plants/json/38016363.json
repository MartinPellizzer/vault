In our previous study, the Moraea sisyrinchium plant showed cytotoxicity against glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Among different parts of this plant (flower, stem, and bulb), the bulb showed better anticancer potential. The present work aimed to test the anticancer activity of different fractions of the bulb extract, to determine its phytochemicals, and to study its mechanism action on glioblastoma.", "The bulb extract was partitioned into different fractions using immiscible solvents. The U87 glioblastoma cells were incubated with the obtained fractions. Then, the cell proliferation assay (MTT), cell migration test (scratch), cell cycle analysis (propidium iodide staining), apoptosis/necrosis assay (annexin V/propidium iodide staining), and real-time PCR (PTEN, Akt, mTOR, BAX and BCL-2 genes) were performed. Phytochemicals were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy.", "The chloroform fraction showed more antiproliferative effect than n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions. Also, chloroform fraction induced cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration ability (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The expression of PTEN, mTOR, and BAX genes was significantly up-regulated, while the expression of Akt and Bcl-2 showed down-regulation. The phytochemicals identified in the chloroform fraction were mainly xanthones, phytosterols, and isoflavones.", "The chloroform fraction of Moraea sisyrinchium bulb inhibits the proliferation and migration of glioblastoma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by upregulation of the PTEN gene and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The identified compounds in the chloroform fraction are potential candidates for further investigation as anticancer agents against glioblastoma."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
