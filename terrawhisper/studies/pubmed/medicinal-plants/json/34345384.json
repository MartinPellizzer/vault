This study evaluated the effect of the saffron petal on hypertension induced by angiotensin II (AII) and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor). Rats were divided into 11 groups: 1) Control, 2) AII (50.00 ng kg<sup>-1</sup>), 3) Losartan+ AII, 4) L-NAME (10.00 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), 5) sodium nitroprusside (SNP) + L-NAME, 6, 7) Saffron petals extract; 8, 9) saffron petals (100 and 200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) + AII and 10,11) saffron petals (100 and 200 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) + L-NAME. Hypertension induced by intravenous injection of AII and L-NAME in separate groups. In treated groups, 30 min before injection of AII or L-NAME rats received two doses of extract via intraperitoneal administration. The femoral artery was cannulated and cardiovascular parameters recorded by a transducer connected to power lab apparatus. Maximal changes (\u2206) of mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) from baseline were calculated and compared to with those in hypertensive and control groups. Results showed that both AII and L-NAME significantly increased SBP and MAP than control, however, HR in AII was decreased and in the L-NAME group increased. Pre-treatment with saffron petals could significantly attenuate the cardiovascular responses induced by both AII and L-NAME. However, the effect of the extract in AII hypertensive rats was more effective than L-NAME groups. The findings showed that the hydroalcoholic extract of the saffron petals had an antihypertensive effect that mainly was mediated by inhibition of AII activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Urmia University.
