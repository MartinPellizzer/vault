Curatella americana is a plant used as a menstrual cycle regulator and to prevent diabetes. This study evaluates the effects of C. americana aqueous extract on the estrous cycle and preimplantation embryos of adult female pups from diabetic rats. Female Sprague Dawley newborn rats received Streptozotocin or vehicle (citrate buffer). At adulthood, were submitted to the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, and mated. The female rats were obtained and were distributed into four experimental groups: OC and OC/T represent female pups of control mothers and received water or plant extract, respectively; OD and OD/T represent female pups of diabetic mothers and received water or plant extract, respectively. The estrous cycle was followed for 10 days, the rats were mated and on gestational day 4 was performed preimplantation embryo analysis. Phenolic composition and biogenic amines in the extract were analyzed about the influence of the thermal process. The female pups from diabetic dams exhibited glucose intolerance, irregular estral cycle and a higher percentage of pre-embryos in delayed development (morula stage). After C. americana treatment, OD/T group no present a regular estrous cycle. Furthermore, the infusion process increases phenolic compounds and biogenic amines levels, which can have anti-estrogenic effect, anticipates the early embryonic development, and impair pre-implantation embryos. Thus, the indiscriminate use of medicinal plants should be avoided in any life phases by women, especially during pregnancy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn.
