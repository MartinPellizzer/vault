Patients allergic to one of these foods have serum IgE antibodies that immunologically cross-react with other legumes. Nevertheless, ingestion of other legumes generally does not induce an allergic reaction, suggesting that cross-reacting antibodies are not clinically relevant.", "This study was designed to identify unique peanut or soybean antigenic fractions, with sera adsorbed to remove cross-reacting antibodies, thus resulting in sera with IgE antibodies unique to either soy or peanut.", "Cross-reacting antibodies to soy were removed from the sera of two patients allergic to peanut and soy and three patients allergic to peanut by soy-affinity chromatography. Cross-reacting antibodies to peanut were adsorbed from the sera of a patient allergic to peanut and soy and a patient allergic to peanut by peanut-affinity chromatography. Adequate removal of cross-reacting antibodies was verified by ELISA after each adsorption step. Unadsorbed sera and sera adsorbed to remove cross-reacting antibodies (either to soy or to peanut) were assayed for specific IgE binding to peanut or soy immunoblots.", "Unique peanut-specific IgE antibodies (i.e., soy antibody-adsorbed) were found to bind to peanut fractions at 46, 29, 25, 19, 17, 14, and 5 kd on immunoblots of whole peanut protein. Similarly, unique soy-specific IgE (i.e., peanut antibody-adsorbed) were found to bind a fraction at 46 kd, and to a lesser extent, to a fraction at 21 kd on immunoblots of whole soy protein. The 73% reduction of IgE antibody binding to peanut by ELISA after adsorption of cross-reacting antibodies indicates extensive cross-reactivity between soy and peanut antigens.", "Antigen-affinity chromatography is an effective method for removal of cross-reacting antibodies. We identified IgE antibody binding (with sera where cross-reacting antibodies were removed) to several unique antigenic fractions of peanut and soy. Further studies will determine the clinical significance of these fractions in IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."}], "LastName": "Eigenmann", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burks", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bannon", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sampson", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AI24439", "Acronym": "AI", "Agency": "NIAID NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Allergy Clin Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "1275002", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immune Sera"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immune Sera"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8939161", "10.1016/s0091-6749(96)80014-5", "S0091674996003156"]}}]}
