In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of this plant extract on carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema in mice. C. asiaticum was serially extracted with petroleum ether, followed by chloroform and lastly, methanol. The chloroform and methanol extracts of the plant given orally (50 mg kg-1) caused significant (p < 0.05; n = 7) reduction in paw oedema but the petroleum ether extract did not induce significant effect (p > 0.05) on paw oedema. The methanol extract was then dissolved in water and extracted consecutively with chloroform, ethyl acetate and butanol. The chloroform fraction of methanol extract (CFME) treatment (50 mg kg(-1)) significantly reduced (p < 0.05; n = 7) the acute paw oedema. This may indicate that active anti-inflammatory compounds are present in the CFME. In an attempt to study the mechanism of action of its anti-inflammatory activity, the effects of CFME on BK- and histamine-induced contractions were investigated in isolated rat uterus and guinea-pig ileum preparations, respectively. It was found that CFME caused dose-dependent reduction (p < 0.05; n = 6) of the contractile response induced by BK and shifted the log dose-response curve of histamine to the right. The present findings suggest that C. asiaticum possessed an anti-inflammatory activity as suggested by its use in traditional medicine. The anti-inflammatory activity of this plant could not have been due to its anti-bradykinin activities as CFME non-specifically inhibited BK-induced contraction. It also suggest that CFME may contain compound(s) with anti-histaminic properties. The significance of these findings is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samud", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asmawi", "ForeName": "M Z", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "J N", "Initials": "JN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yusof", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "7902474", "ISSNLinking": "0162-3109"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S8TIM42R2W", "NameOfSubstance": "Bradykinin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bradykinin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Contraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10596868", "10.1016/s0162-3109(99)00132-0", "S0162-3109(99)00132-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
