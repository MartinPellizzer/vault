The hypotensive activity of an aqueous extract of Andrographis paniculata was studied using chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) infusions by osmotic pumps. The extract exhibited a dose-dependent hypotensive effect on the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. The optimum hypotensive dose determined was repeated in a study in SHR and their normotensive controls, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, to demonstrate its comparative effects on the SBP, plasma and lung angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activities, as well as on lipid peroxidation in the kidneys, as measured by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. 3. The extract significantly lowered the SBP of both SHR and WKY rats. 4. Plasma, but not lung, ACE activity and kidney TBA level were significantly lower in extract-treated SHR when compared with vehicle-treated SHR controls. 5. Plasma and lung ACE activities as well as kidney TBA levels were not significantly different between extract- and vehicle-treated WKY rats. 6. This study indicates that the aqueous extract of A. paniculata lowers SBP in the SHR possibly by reducing circulating ACE in the plasma as well as by reducing free radical levels in the kidneys. The mechanism(s) of hypotensive action seems to be different in WKY rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "C Y", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0425076", "ISSNLinking": "0305-1870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.15.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Parenteral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred SHR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred WKY"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8886488", "10.1111/j.1440-1681.1996.tb01756.x"]}}]}
