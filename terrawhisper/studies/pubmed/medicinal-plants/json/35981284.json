Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> possessed three rare dimerization patterns constructed by cytisine, whereas compounds <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> represented the first example of the addition products of cytisine and 5,6-dihydroxy-4-hexanolide. Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis and quantum chemistry calculations including GIAO <sup>13</sup>C{<sup>1</sup>H} NMR and ECD calculation, combined with single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Biologically, compound <b>3</b> displayed significant anti-tobacco mosaic virus activity compared with the positive control ningnanmycin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
