During the recent past a number of compounds have been tested for their anticarcinogenic potential specially constituents of human diet. The enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), which catalyses the transfer of glutamyl groups of peptides to other peptides and amino acids, has been proposed as a marker of cell proliferation and neoplasia. It also serves as a tool to evaluate the carcinogenic and cocarcinogenic potential of environmental toxicants. In the present investigations, GGT activity induced by carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, viz. 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was significantly inhibited by diallylsulfide (DAS) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) in mouse skin. DAS and I3C are constituents of garlic. A significant inhibition in GGT levels was also observed in a strong mitogen (12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate) induced activity by pretreatment of DAS/I3C in mouse skin. Therefore these dietary constituents seem to be strong modifiers of chemically induced carcinogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Carcinogenesis Division, Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Environ Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8909524", "ISSNLinking": "0895-3988"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C11E72455F", "NameOfSubstance": "indole-3-carbinol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.2.2", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "gamma-Glutamyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10560536"]}}]}
