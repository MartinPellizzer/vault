Large-scale comparison on the polysaccharides of Panax ginseng (PG), P. quinquefolius (PQ), P. notoginseng (PN), Red ginseng (RG), P. japonicus (ZJS), and P. japonicus var. major (ZZS), was performed by both chemical and biological approaches. Holistic fingerprinting at polysaccharide and the hydrolyzed oligosaccharide and monosaccharide levels utilized various chromatography methods, while OGD and OGD/R models on H9c2 cells were introduced to evaluate the protective effects on cell viability and mitochondrial function. Polysaccharides from six ginseng species exhibited remarkable content difference (RG\u00a0>\u00a0PG/ZZS/ZJS/PQ\u00a0>\u00a0PN), but weak differentiations in molecular weight distribution and oligosaccharide profiles, while Glc and GalA were richer for monosaccharide compositions of PG and RG polysaccharides, respectively. RG polysaccharides (25/50/100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) showed significant cardiomyocyte protection by regulating mitochondrial functions. These new evidences may provide support for the supplementary role of polysaccharides in quality control of ginseng."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
