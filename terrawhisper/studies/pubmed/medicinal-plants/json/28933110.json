The content of active constituents were detected by HPLC. RNA was extracted with RNA prep Pure RNA purification kit (Tiangen). The results shows that LaCl3 processing promoted the accumulation of tanshinones and phenolic acids in S. miltiorrhiza hairy root. The accumulation of phenolic acids reached the highest at 9 d after treatment, and tanshinones accumulation continued to increase in 15 days. Accumulation of active substance in S. miltiorrhiza may relate with FPPS, TAT, HPPR several key enzyme activation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Li-Hua", "Initials": "LH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Bing-Qian", "Initials": "BQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology,University of Ji'nan, Ji'nan 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Control Technology, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03UUH3J385", "NameOfSubstance": "tanshinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6I3K30563S", "NameOfSubstance": "Lanthanum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lanthanum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933110", "10.4268/cjcmm20162309"]}}]}
