This extract, containing approximately 10% sugar, 0.3% nitrogen, and 0.4% ash, was termed garlic sugar solution. This garlic sugar solution (Medium 1) was used as the suspending medium for Ehrlich ascites tumor cells attenuated with allicin, the main principle of garlic, and 0.9% NaCl solution containing streptomycin and penicillin (Medium 2) was also used as the suspending medium. Mice of DDD strain were immunized with the attenuated tumor cells suspended in Medium 1 or 2. After immunization, the immunized and control mice were challenged intraperitoneally with viable Ehrlich ascites tumorcells. Animals immunized with the attenuated tumor cells suspended in Medium 1 acquired significantly stronger resistance against the tumor cells than animals immunized with those suspended in Medium 2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakata", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujiwara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Gan", "NlmUniqueID": "0151745", "ISSNLinking": "0016-450X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Subcutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1183776"]}}]}
