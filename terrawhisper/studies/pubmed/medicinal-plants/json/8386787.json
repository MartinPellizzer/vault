Below 5 x 10(-10) g/ml TTX, 10(-6) g/l AS reversed the blocking effect of TTX on INa and increased the current amplitude. For TTX concentrations ranging from 5 x 10(-10) to 5 x 10(-8) g/ml, which partially blocked INa and lengthened its time to peak, 10(-6) g/l AS reinforced the blocking effect on the current. The inhibitory effect of AS was then studied in the presence of 10(-9) g/ml TTX which was assumed to block all the sarcolemmal sodium channels and not the tubular ones. It appeared to be strongly voltage-dependent since it was fully relieved when the cell was hyperpolarized by 20 mV and was maximum at holding potential (h.p.) -70 mV (100% blockage of INa instead of 50% at h.p. -90 mV). Contrary to observations in depolarised fibres (in which the inhibitory effect of AS decreased as concentration rose) the INa blockage increased with concentration in TTX-treated fibres. It is concluded that AS extract exerts an antagonistic effect on tubular sodium channels by acting on a single site which is different from the high affinity inhibitory site demasked in normal fibres by depolarization of the resting membrane potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, University of Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Ewane-Nyambi", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raymond", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4368-28-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrodotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rana ridibunda"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcolemma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetrodotoxin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8386787", "10.1016/0378-8741(93)90078-j", "0378-8741(93)90078-J"]}}]}
