The chemical structure of <b>1</b> was elucidated using extensive spectral methods and the known compounds (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) were identified by comparing their spectral data with those reported in the literature. All known compounds (<b>2</b>-<b>7</b>) were isolated from the genus <i>Artocarpus</i> for the first time. The anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV activities of all isolated prenylated coumarins (1-7) were assessed <i>in\u00a0vitro.</i> As a result, compounds <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> displayed notable inhibitory effects against nitric oxide (NO) production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> with the IC<sub>50</sub> values in range of 0.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.06 to 6.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u03bcM.
