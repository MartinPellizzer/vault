There is growing interest in finding drugs to treat metabolic diseases from natural compounds due to their good efficacy and limited side effects. Over the past few decades, many phytochemicals derived from natural plants, such as berberine, curcumin, quercetin, resveratrol, rutin, and hesperidin, have been shown to have good pharmacological activity against metabolic diseases in preclinical studies. More importantly, clinical trials using these phytochemicals to treat metabolic diseases have been increasing. This review comprehensively summarizes the clinical progress of phytochemicals derived from natural plants in the treatment of several metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Accumulating clinical evidence shows that a total of 18 phytochemicals have good therapeutic effects on the three metabolic diseases by lowering blood glucose and lipid levels, reducing insulin resistance, enhancing insulin sensitivity, increasing energy expenditure, improving liver function, and relieving inflammation and oxidative stress. The information will help us better understand the medicinal value of these phytochemicals and promote their clinical application in the treatment of metabolic diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
