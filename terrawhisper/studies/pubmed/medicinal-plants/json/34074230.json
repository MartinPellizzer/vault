The phytochemical study was divided into two parts: the first deals with isolation of the chemical constituents using different chromatographic techniques that resulted in isolation of four compounds. The chemical structures of the pure isolated compounds were elucidated using different spectroscopic data. The second part deals with identification of the rest of the constituents using the GC technique. Additionally, both crude extract and the pure isolated compounds were investigated for cytotoxic activity. One of the isolated compounds; namely glyceryl 1-monopalmitate showed highly promising effect against the MCF-7 cells with (IC<sub>50</sub> = 19.78\u2009\u00b5M) compared to 5-FU (26.98\u2009\u00b5M), and it remarkably stimulated apoptotic breast cancer cell death with 31.6-fold (16.13% compared to 0.51 for the control) at pre-G1 and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and blocked the progression of MCF-7 cells. Moreover, the identified compounds especially <b>1</b> were found to have high binding affinity towards both TPK and VEGFR-2 through the molecular docking studies which highlight its mode of action. HighlightsChemical profiling of <i>Phyllostachys heterocycla</i> bark nonpolar extract was fully identified.Glyceryl 1-monopalmitate showed highly promising effect against the MCF-7 cells with (IC<sub>50</sub> = 19.78 \u00b5M) compared to 5-FU (26.98 \u00b5M).Glyceryl 1-monopalmitate significantly stimulated apoptotic breast cancer cell death with 31.6-fold by arresting cell cycle at G2/M and preG1 phases.Molecular docking simulation showed good binding affinities towards TPK and VEGFR-2 proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
