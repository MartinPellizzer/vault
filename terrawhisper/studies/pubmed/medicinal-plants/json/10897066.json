The effect of meliacine, an antiviral compound isolated from leaves of Melia azedarach L. that inhibits HSV-1 replication in vitro, was examined on experimental corneal HSV-1 inoculation in Balb/c mice. Mice were inoculated with HSV-1 strain KOS at their corneas after abrasion. Meliacine was administered topically 3 times a day for 4 days beginning 1 day before inoculation. Infected animals treated or not with meliacine were observed carefully for the development of stromal keratitis and the clinical scoring was done 14 days post-infection. Histological examination of corneas and viral isolation from eyes from HSV-1 infected mice treated or not with meliacine were also carried out. It was found that the treatment of HSV-1-induced ocular disease in Balb/c mice with meliacine reduced significantly the development of clinical disease, as well as the histological damage in corneas. The viral titers detected in eyes of infected and treated mice were 2-orders-of-magnitude lower than those corresponding to HSV-1 infected control animals. Mock-infected and treated mice did not reveal any corneal alteration due to the administration of the compound. Meliacine was found to exert a strong antiviral action on HSV-1-induced ocular disease in mice with no evidence of toxic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Virology, Department of Biochemistry, School of Science, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. lalche@qb.fcen.uba.ar"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alch\u00e9", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Berra", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veloso", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coto", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7705876", "ISSNLinking": "0146-6615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Cornea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Keratitis, Herpetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Plaque Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10897066", "10.1002/1096-9071(200008)61:4<474::AID-JMV10>3.0.CO;2-K"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
