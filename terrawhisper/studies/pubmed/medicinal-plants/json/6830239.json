By the sensitive analysis of the pigments using high-performance liquid chromatography, the presence of four protochlorophylls esterified with phytol, tetrahydrogeranylgeraniol (THGG), dihydrogeranylgeraniol (DHGG), and geranylgeraniol (GG) was detected in kidney bean grown in the dark. Similar components were also observed in the etiolated seedlings of cucumber, sunflower, and corn. The content of each protochlorophyll species changed with the plant species and age of plants. In the case of kidney bean, the content of protochlorophyll phytol reached a maximal level at 9 days, then decreased rapidly during the subsequent development, in spite of the total protochlorophyll content remaining unchanged. In contrast to the degradation of protochlorophyll phytol, the other three protochlorophylls esterified with THGG, DHGG, and GG accumulated. These results may indicate that (i) protochlorophyll phytol is formed from the first esterified protochlorophyll GG through the next three hydrogenation steps as in the case of chlorophyll a phytol formation; (ii) the esterification reaction stops at 9 days and then reaction proceeds in sequence in the reverse direction, leading to the dehydrogenation of the alcohol moiety of protochlorophyll phytol to protochlorophylls THGG, DHGG, and GG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shioi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "20369-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Protochlorophyllide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Protochlorophyllide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6830239", "10.1016/0003-9861(83)90412-5", "0003-9861(83)90412-5"]}}]}
