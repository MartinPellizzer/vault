In this study, a double-layered electrospun biofiber scaffold biomaterial including Polycaprolactone (PCL)/Collagen (COL) fibrous inner layer and PCL/ <i>Momordica charantia</i> (MC) and <i>Hypericum perforatum (HP)</i> oils fibrous outer layer was developed to manufacture a functional, novel tissue scaffold with the advantageous mechanical and biological properties. The main approach was to combine the natural perspective using medicinal oils with an engineering point of view to fabricate a potential functional scaffold for tissue engineering. Medicinal plants MC and HP are rich in functional oils and incorporation of them in a tissue scaffold will unveil their potential to augment both new tissue formation and wound healing. In this study, a novel double-layered scaffold prototype was fabricated using electrospinning technique with two PCL fiber layers, first is composed of collagen, and second is composed of oils extracted from medicinal plants. Initially, the composition of plant oils was analyzed. Thereafter the biofiber scaffold layers were fabricated and were evaluated in terms of morphology, physicochemistry, thermal and mechanical features, wettability, in vitro bio-degradability. Double-layered scaffold prototype was further analyzed in terms of in vitro biocompatibility and antibacterial effect. The medicinal oils blend provided antioxidant and antibacterial properties to the novel PCL/Oils layer. The results signify that inner PCL/COL layer exhibited advanced biodegradability of 8.5% compared to PCL and enhanced wettability with 11.7\u00b0 contact angle. Strength of scaffold prototype was 5.98 N/mm<sup>2</sup> thanks to the elastic PCL fibrous matrix. The double-layered functional biofiber scaffold enabled 92% viability after 72\u2009h contact with fibroblast cells and furthermore provided feasible attachment sites for the cells. The functional scaffold prototype's noteworthy mechanical, chemical, and biological features enable it to be suggested as a different novel biomaterial with the potential to be utilized in tissue engineering applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0259-4298"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering, Institute of Science, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zade & Zade Vital Ibn-i Sina R&D Center, Zade Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ediz", "ForeName": "Emre Fatih", "Initials": "EF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u0130zmir Vocational School, Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, \u0130zmir, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcne\u015f", "ForeName": "Cansu", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7300-4075"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Demirel Kars", "ForeName": "Meltem", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, KTO Karatay University, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Avc\u0131", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Biomater Funct Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "101586617", "ISSNLinking": "2280-8000"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Momordica charantia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Scaffolds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyesters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38217369", "10.1177/22808000231221067"]}}]}
