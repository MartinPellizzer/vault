Medicinal plant stem cells come from a broad category of medicinal plants, including ethnic medicinal plants, folk medicinal plants, original plants of health products, vegetables, fruits, and other potential medicinal plants. At present, the techniques for the isolation, identification, preservation and culture of medicinal plant stem cells have become increasingly mature, and the mechanism of stem cell differentiation, growth and regulation of secondary metabolites has been studied in depth. Medicinal plant stem cells have a broad application prospect in medicine, health food, food and medical beauty products. As a strategic resource, the construction of the &quot;Global Medicinal Plant Stem Cell Bank&quot; was first proposed to preserve various kinds of medicinal plant resources in the world, and it will go global relying on the internationalization strategy of traditional Chinese medicine. The bank should follow safety, environmental protection, advanced and practical design principles. The main construction contents include the original plant bank, stem cell bank, component resource bank, gene bank, database and resource sharing system, with genetic and data resources incorporated into the scope of protection and utilization. The bank will establish a new strategy for medicinal plant resources protection and regeneration, and provide a new resource for natural products drug discovery and a technology sharing platform for various medicinal plant stem cells. As a resource treasury, a source of innovative technologies and a center of cooperation, it will become the core driving force of the global medicinal plant stem cell industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ran-Ran", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng-Yue", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Stem Cell Joint Research and Development Laboratory,Qingdao Yanding Cell Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
