Then cDNA was synthesized and cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI sites of the ZAP Express vector using a cDNA synthesis kit, and the ligation mixture was packaged using a ZAP-cDNA Gigapack Gold III cloning kit (Stratagene). The single phage was isolated for PCR amplification, Aliquots of the PCR reactions were analyzed in a 1.5% agarose gel to verify the quality of PCR. The remaining cDNA was purified by Multiscreen filter plates (Millipore) and aliquots were analyzed by agarose gel again to verify the quality of purification. Clones passed verification was resuspended in 15 microL 50% DMSO for arraying. An actin gene from S. miltiorrhiza was used for positive control. PloyA and 50% DMSO was used for negative controls.", "Bacterial colonies containing cNDAs of S. miltiorrhiza were inserted with average insert size of 0. 5 kb to 2. 5 kb. Total 4 354 genes were singled out from the first 8 736 PCR product and used for cDNA microarray manufacture. Single color fluorescence hybridization showed that all positive controls had signals while negative controls had no signals.", "It was the first cDNA microarray about traditional Chinese herbs especially for geoherbs. It could be a powerful tool for studying functional genomics of S. miltiorrhiza."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Guang-hong", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xiao-jing", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "De-you", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xue-yong", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Gui-fang", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17802870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
