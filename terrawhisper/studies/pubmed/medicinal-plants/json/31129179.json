It is affecting human health regardless of their gender, age, eating habits, and ecological location. Many drugs and therapies are available for its cure still the need for effective targeted drugs and therapies are of paramount importance. In the recent past, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling (including channels/transporters/pumps) are being studied as a plausible target for combating the cancer menace. Many evidence has shown that the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is altered in cancer cells and the remodelling is linked with tumor instigation, angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Focusing on these altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling tool kit for cancer treatment is a cross-cutting and emerging area of research. In addition, there are numerous phytomolecules which can be exploited as a potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> (channels/transporters/ pumps) modulators in the context of targeting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in the cancer cell. In the present review, a list of plant-based potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> (channel/transporters/pumps) modulators has been reported which could have application in the framework of repurposing the potential drugs to target Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling pathways in cancer cells. This review also aims to gain attention in and support for prospective research in this field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
