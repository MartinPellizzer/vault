An illustration of this can be found in one of the earlier scientific studies on phytomedicines, the Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi and his colleagues [170] found that flavanone extracts from the Capsicum spp contain an ascorbate-protective factor. It has now been repeatedly shown that the electron-donating properties of the phytochemical flavonoids, providing both nutritive and chemotherapeutic benefits, are the basis of their antioxidant action [171-175]. Studies by zoologists have demonstrated that animals, by selectively choosing specific plants, soils, and clays, maintain their health and treat themselves in times of ill health. The term zoopharmacognosy, now well researched, has been coined to describe the study of this recognized phenomenon. Long ago, Isaac Newton stated that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The same may be seen in plants and plant material. The same may be said of life in general. At the most basic concept, we are talking of electrons and their activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutritional Laboratories, High House, Penrhos, Raglan, Monmouthshire NP15 2DJ, UK. nlarkins@nutri.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Larkins", "ForeName": "Nicholas", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wynn", "ForeName": "Susan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Clin North Am Small Anim Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "7809942", "ISSNLinking": "0195-5616"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Organic"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Veterinary Medicine"}], "NumberOfReferences": "175"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15032133", "10.1016/j.cvsm.2003.09.006", "S0195-5616(03)00130-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
