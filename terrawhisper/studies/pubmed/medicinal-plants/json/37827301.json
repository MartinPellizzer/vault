Thus, vines have displayed great medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).", "Although some popular vine species have been intensively investigated, the comparable features and medicinal specifications among a vast collection of taxonomic groups based on data visualization methods are relatively lacking in attention. Moreover, the translatability of vines from ancient ethnomedical evidence to modern medical system has not been well established. This review tends to quantitatively summarize the strength of vines in healthcare from the perspectives of medicinal part, traditional function, clinical spectrum, phytochemistry divergence, pharmacological attributes, toxicity as well as the progress of proprietary drug development.", "Medicinal vines were retrieved from databases of drug standards and curated catalogues. Synonyms of plant origin across different datasets were normalized by accepted scientific names in the World Flora Online. The distribution patterns and rank of plant origin, medicinal parts, traditional functions and target conditions, as well as the correlation between phytochemical composition and clinical applications were analyzed and visualized.", "A total of 121 crude drugs from 36 families, 77 genera, 133 species of vines were obtained and analyzed. The Fabaceae, Menispermaceae and Rubiaceae were the highest ranked families of medicinal vines. Not surprisingly, stem was the most dominant medical part. Moreover, \"eliminate wind\" displayed a hub node in the traditional function co-occurrence network. In addition to joint impediment disorders, these vines particularly displayed a wide range of therapeutic modalities toward conditions from various organ systems. Chemotaxonomic properties-oriented phytochemical analysis was performed and the chemical diversity among medicinal vines complementarily determined a certain group of therapeutic domains. Particularly, the anti-inflammatory effect and antiarthritic effect were highlighted for treating rheumatic diseases. Using integral animal models and cultured cells, modern pharmacological actions of medicinal vines have been largely observed and validated according to their traditional ethnopharmacology. Furthermore, a small proportion of vine species are well-known toxic plants. Successful drug development pipelines in rheumatic, cardiovascular, liver, malignant and infectious diseases have offered the capacity to generate new treatment options that are being sought out from vine plants.", "Medicinal vines are rich sources of Chinese Material Medica (CMM) and good fit for a variety of clinical manifestations beyond arthritis and rheumatic diseases. In addition to stem, other parts are also popular for both medicines and dietary supplements. Vine plants provide extensive biologically relevant chemical space for developing value-creating drugs. Thus, our analysis can be useful for further motivating and strengthening the preclinical and clinical research of vine-derived remedies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
