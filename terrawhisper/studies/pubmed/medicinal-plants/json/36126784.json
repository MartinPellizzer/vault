(AE) is a Chinese medicinal herb that is traditionally used to treat various circulatory diseases. It exhibits certain effects, such as the promotion of blood circulation and cooling, rash clearance, and detoxification.", "This study was designed to explore the hepatoprotective and hemostatic effects of the ethyl acetate extract of AE in rats with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury.", "Wistar rats were treated via oral gavage with different doses of the ethyl acetate extract of AE (3.5, 7, or 14\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>) for 14 consecutive days, following which hemostatic and liver function tests were conducted. For the hemostatic tests, the platelet count, blood platelet aggregation, blood platelet adhesion to fibrinogen, platelet factor 4 (PF-4) secretion from blood platelets, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and fibrinogen levels were measured at the end of the treatment period. For the liver function tests, 0.25 mL/200\u00a0g (1.25\u00a0mL\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>) of olive oil was injected into the abdominal cavity of the control rats, whereas 15% CCl<sub>4</sub> plus olive oil (prescription: 7.5\u00a0mL CCl<sub>4</sub>\u00a0+\u00a042.5 olive oil) was injected into that of the treated rats at 1\u00a0h after extract administration on day 6, 13, and 20. Additionally, food and water were withheld from all the animals. On the following day, the rats were anesthetized and their albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) levels were measured. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels among the groups were determined using a one-way analysis of variance.", "The platelet count and blood platelet aggregation, blood platelet adhesion to fibrinogen and PF-4 secretion levels were significantly increased in the (3.5\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) AE group as compared to those in the control group (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; for the 7 and 14\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> AE groups, all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05, respectively). Although the PT and aPTT were not affected by the AE extract (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), the TT was reduced and the FIB levels were significantly increased in all AE groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Liver function tests showed that CCl<sub>4</sub> caused significant liver damage, thereby decreasing the albumin, SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GR, and GPx levels, while increasing the AST, ALT, ALP, SGOT, SGPT, GGT, LDH, ROS, and MDA levels (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). By contrast, treatment with the different doses of AE extract reversed the CCl<sub>4</sub> effects on all these parameters. Compared with the levels in the CCl<sub>4</sub> group, the GSH and GR levels in the three AE groups (3.5, 7, and 14\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup>) were significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively), whereas the differences in the other parameters for these three groups were all at the significance levels of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively.", "AE extracts administered orally exhibited hepatoprotective activity by affecting platelet production and blood coagulation and ameliorating liver function-damaging modifications. Specifically, a dosage of 3.5\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>\u00b7day<sup>-1</sup> resulted in the most optimal effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
