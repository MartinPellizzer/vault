FRs are highly overexpressed in many tumor cells (like ovarian, lung, breast, kidney, brain, endometrial, and colon cancer), and targeting them through conjugates bearing specific ligand with encapsulated nanodrug moiety is undoubtedly, a promising approach toward tumor targeting. Folate, being an endogenous ligand, can be exploited well to affect various cellular events occurring during the progress of tumor, in a more natural and definite way. Thus, the aim of the review lies in summarizing the advancements taken place in the drug delivery system of different therapeutics through FRs and to refine its role as an endogenous ligand, in targeting of synthetic as well as natural bioactives. The review also provides an update on the patents received on the folate-based drug delivery system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a University Institute of Pharmacy, Pt.
