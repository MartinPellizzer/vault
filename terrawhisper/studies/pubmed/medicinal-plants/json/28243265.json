Nanoemulsions of almond oil containing budesonide, as a hydrophobic model drug molecule, were prepared and optimized. Then, the effect of variation of surfactant/co-surfactant concentration on the aerodynamic properties of the nebulized aerosol was studied. The results indicated that the most physically stable formulation makes the smallest aerodynamic size. The concentration of co-surfactant was also shown to be critical in determination of aerodynamic size. Furthermore, the optimized sample, with 3% w/w almond oil, 20% w/w Tween 80+Span 80 and 2% w/w ethanol showed a smaller MMAD in comparison with the commercially available suspension and the micellar solution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.; Research Center of Natural Product Safety and Medicinal Plants, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd , Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamali", "ForeName": "Hosein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics (I.B.B), University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Shayan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Islamic Azad University, Karaj branch, Karaj, Iran ."}], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Mohammad Ali", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. ; Medical Biomaterials Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amani", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101208407", "ISSNLinking": "1726-6882"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Shah P, Bhalodia D, Shelat P.
