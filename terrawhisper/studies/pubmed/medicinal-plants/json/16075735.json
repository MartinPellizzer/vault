ALI model was established by iv oleic acid (0.05 mL x kg(-1)) in these groups, and then iv above drugs respectively,while in control group, the same volume of normal saline was given. The respiratory amplitude and rate were observed, and blood samples were taken from cervical artery for blood-gas analysis before and at 30, 60, 120 min after oleic acid or normal saline administration. At the end of experiment, the concentration of LDH, CAT and MDA in the lung tissue were measured and pathologic changes of lung tissue were observed microscopically.", "Compared with oleic acid group, the respiratory amplitude markedly enhanced (P < 0.05) in the low and high dose groups of Qingkailing and Shengmai injection. PaO2 increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the low dose group of combined Qingkailing and Shengmai injection, PaCO2 decreased markedly (P < 0.05) in the low dose groups of Qingkailing and Shengmai injection alone and combined. The level of MDA significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the each group of Qingkailing and Shengmai injection alone, the level of MDA significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and CAT increased (P < 0.05) in the low dose group of combined Qingkailing with Shengmai injection. The low dose group of combined Qingkailing and Shengmai injection can alleviate the pathological changes induced by oleic acid.", "The curative effect of the low dose group of combined Qingkailing with Shengmai injection for the ALI induced by oleic acid was better than Qingkailing and Shengmai injection alone at the same dosage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Material Medica, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beiing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-ying", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Gui-you", "Initials": "GY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lang", "ForeName": "Ri-xin", "Initials": "RX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiu-rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Hai-feng", "Initials": "HF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zi-lun", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shuang-rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Lian-qiang", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xiao-xin", "Initials": "XX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16075735"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
