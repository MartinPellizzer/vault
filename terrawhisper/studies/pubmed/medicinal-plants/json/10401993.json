Stimulation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with TO after the treatment of recombinant interferon-gamma (rIFN-gamma) resulted in increased NO synthesis. TO had no effect on NO synthesis by itself. When TO was used in combination with rIFN-gamma, there was a marked cooperative induction of NO synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. The optimal effect of TO on NO synthesis was shown 6 h after treatment with rIFN-gamma. This increase in NO synthesis was manifested as an increased amount of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein. NO production was inhibited by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine. The increased production of NO from rIFN-gamma plus TO-stimulated cells was decreased by treatment with a protein kinase C inhibitor such as staurosporin. In addition, synergy between rIFN-gamma and TO was mainly dependent on TO-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion. All the preparations of TO were endotoxin free. These results suggest that the capacity of TO to increase NO production from rIFN-gamma-primed mouse peritoneal macrophages is the result of TO-induced TNF-alpha secretion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Chonbuk, South Korea. hmkim@med.wonkwang.ac.kr"}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Gen Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7602417", "ISSNLinking": "0306-3623"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27JT06E6GR", "NameOfSubstance": "omega-N-Methylarginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H88EPA0A3N", "NameOfSubstance": "Staurosporine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Staurosporine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "omega-N-Methylarginine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10401993", "10.1016/s0306-3623(98)00227-4", "S0306362398002274"]}}]}
