Due to their cytotoxic potential against cancer cells, recently many studies of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) have been conducted. In the current work, we aim to evaluate the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects of CuNPs on the human breast (MCF-7) and colon (LoVo) cancer cells. CuNPs were prepared in starch-stabilizing aqueous solution by electroless deposition technique in alkaline tartrate bath using formaldehyde as the reducing agent of copper sulfate. The obtained CuNPs were characterized by SEM, TEM, and XRD to confirm the particle size, morphology, and chemical composition. Standard colorimetric MTT and LDH assays were used to estimate the cytotoxic effect of CuNPs on MCF-7 and LoVo cells. Furthermore, CuNP-treated cells undergoing apoptosis were assessed based on the expression of apoptosis-related genes using qRT-PCR. The results indicate that the mean particle size of the synthesized CuNPs was ~\u200950-60\u00a0nm, and they were spherical in shape with mainly the chemical structure of the copper metallic phase. MTT assay revealed that CuNPs induced cytotoxicity in tested cells with IC<sub>50</sub> rates of 16.4 (in MCF-7) and 21.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (in LoVo). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed that CuNPs caused a significant increment of Bax, P53, and Caspases 9, 8, and 3 genes. Overall, the anticancer potential of prepared CuNPs were reported through apoptotic induction which highlight the potential use of CuNPs as an efficient anticancer agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, College of Science, Imam Mohammad ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Riyadh, 11623, Saudi Arabia.
