(Araliaceae). This species has been harvested from forests in North America for more than 250 years. Average expected heterozygosity was significantly greater within protected populations (H(e) = 0.076) than within populations in which harvesting was permitted (H(e) = 0.070). More notably, genetic structure was greater among unprotected populations (G(ST) = 0.491) than among protected populations (G(ST) = 0.167). These differences in the level and distribution of genetic diversity in American ginseng populations indicate that harvesting may have significant evolutionary implications for this species. Age class structure also shifted toward smaller, nonreproductive plants in unprotected populations. Juvenile plants had lower genetic diversity (H(e) = 0.067) than reproductive plants (H(e) = 0.076) suggesting that conserving a proportion of the largest (oldest) plants in each population is important to protect reproductive fitness and the evolutionary potential of the species. Due to its high genetic structure, conservation recommendations include protecting populations throughout the range of P. quinquefolius."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, 2502 Plant Sciences Building, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia 30602 USA;"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cruse-Sanders", "ForeName": "Jennifer M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamrick", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0370467", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9122"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21653409", "10.3732/ajb.91.4.540", "91/4/540"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
