Lupinus plants have been used for heart stimulants, nerves, urinary tract infections, skin disorders, and psoriasis in folk medicine. This review aims to recap the traditional medicinal uses, nutritional value, phytochemical profile, and biological activities of Lupinus species.", "From the literature survey, Lupinus is considered as a factory of various phytochemicals like flavonoids, iso-flavonoids, alkaloids, triterpenoids. The presence of proteins, essential fatty acids, and amino acids, as well as alkaloids, minerals, and dietary fibers, indicated that the plants in this genus had a high nutritional value. The Lupinus extracts displayed promising antidiabetic, anticancer, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities.", "The current review provides updated information that could drive the researchers for further studies. The in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated various pharmacological properties. Some pharmacokinetic and toxicological investigations are warranted to ensure its safety and validity for human use."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
