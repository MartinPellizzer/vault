After a 2-h ischemia and a 24-h reperfusion, the infarct volume and neurological deficit were determined by the method of TTC staining and the Longa's score. The effect of sodium beta-aescin on the migration of neutrophils was evaluated by measuring the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme. The expressions of adhesion molecules were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.", "Sodium beta-aescin significantly reduced the cerebral infarct volume and ameliorated the neurological deficit (P<0.05 or P<0.01). The MPO activity and the expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in the vehicle-treated rats were increased significantly (P<0.01) after cerebral I/R. After treatment with sodium beta-aescin, the enzymatic activity of MPO and the expressions of these adhesion molecules were significantly reduced compared with the vehicle-treated group (P<0.05 or P<0.01).", "Sodium beta-aescin can attenuate brain injury, down-regulate the protein expressions of ICAM-1 and E-selectin, and reduce the migration of neutrophils after cerebral I/R."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Xia-min", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Fan-dian", "Initials": "FD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "E-Selectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "126547-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6805-41-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Escin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aesculus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "E-Selectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Escin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15210059"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
