(BMJ) commonly known as Brahmi in Hindi was examined using gastric ulcer models induced by ethanol, aspirin, 2 h cold restraint stress and 4 h pylorus ligation. Bocapa monniera juice (BMJ) at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg and sucralfate at a dose of 250 mg/kg were given orally, twice daily for 5 days. BMJ 100-300 mg/kg produced significant antiulcer activity in all the experimental gastric ulcer models except in case of ethanol-induced ulcers where 100 mg/kg was not found to decrease it significantly. BMJ (100-300 mg/kg) was found to have little or no effect on the offensive acid-pepsin secretion, while cell shedding (microgram DNA/mg of protein) and mucin secretion in terms of total carbohydrates:protein ration (TC:P), the two important parameters of defensive factors were significantly decreased and increased respectively indicating enhancement of protective mucosal factors. Both BMJ (300 mg/kg) and SF showed tendency to increase the mucosal glycoproteins in terms of TC:P, though individual carbohydrates and total carbohydrates were either increased or showed a tendency to increase. Thus, ulcer protective effect of BMJ may be due to its effect on mucosal defensive factors like enhanced mucin secretion, mucosal glycoprotein and decreased cell shedding rather than on offensive factors such as acid and pepsin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-221 005."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "C V", "Initials": "CV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sairam", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374707", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54182-58-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucralfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.23.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Pepsin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Juice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pepsin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sucralfate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11214498"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
