Each extract was prepared in six concentrations and evaluated for antifungal activity via a micro-broth dilution method. Further phytochemical study of the aerial parts of <i>Plumbago europaea</i>, as the most promising source of anti-<i>Candida</i> compounds (with minimum inhibitory concentration of about 7\u03bcg/ml), was carried out and antifungal activity in the ethyl acetate extract was tracked using a combination of HPLC time-based fractionation and Thin Layer Chromatography-Bioautography via a bioassay-guided fractionation procedure. The compounds in the active region of the chromatogram were purified by a combination of column chromatography and preparative TLC, and then structure elucidation was achieved by 1D and 2D NMR, mass spectrometry and UV spectra.", "Seven compounds were isolated and identified: (1) plumbagin, (2) isoplumbagin, (3) 5, 8-dihydroxy-2-methyl-[1, 4] naphthoquinone, (4) droserone, (5) 7-methyljuglone, (6) Isozeylanone, and (7) methylene-3, 3'-diplumbagin. Antimicrobial activity of the purified compounds were also evaluated against <i>C. albicans</i> (MIC values ranging from 2 to 2500 \u03bcM) and <i>Gardnerella vaginalis</i> (MIC values ranging from 20 to 2500 \u03bcM).", "These naphthoquinone compounds could be surveyed for finding new and more effective anti-vaginitis agents via drug design approaches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry and Essential Oils Technology, Factually of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sobhani", "ForeName": "Marzieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Evin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbas-Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Evin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimi", "ForeName": "Samad Nejad", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.C., Evin, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aliahmadi", "ForeName": "Atousa", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "101518404", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3289"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Favre-Godal Q, Queiroz EF, Wolfender JL.
