Okra is a quercetin-containing plant which can induce pancreas regeneration and has antidiabetic effect. There has been a lot of research that demonstrate that purple okra contains more quercetin than green okra.", "To demonstrate the advantages of purple okra over green okra on the diabetic markers improvement in diabetic rats.", "Fifteen male 2-month-old Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with 65 mg streptozotocin and 110 mg niacinamide. Their blood glucose levels were measured three days after the injection. The induction of diabetes was deemed \u00a0successful if the glucose level of the rats got higher than 250 mg/dL, and then such rats were considered diabetic. The diabetic rats were divided into three groups: an acarbose group, a purple okra powder group, and a green okra powder group. The latter two were given, respectively, purple and green okra powder for 28 days. Blood serum was taken to examine the fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-B and GLUT-4 levels. Pancreas was examined histologically for damage using hematoxylin eosin staining.", "Fasting blood glucose, insulin, HOMA-B, and GLUT-4 levels of diabetic rats that received purple okra powder (p<0.05) were better than those of the rats that received green okra powder. The least damage (p<0.05) to pancreatic beta cells was found in the purple okra powder group.", "Purple okra is superior to green okra in terms of improving the diabetic markers of rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Islam Sultan Agung, Semarang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Tyagita", "ForeName": "Nurina", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Diponegoro, Semarang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Mahati", "ForeName": "Endang", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2147-8906"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Islam Sultan Agung, Semarang, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Safitri", "ForeName": "Azizah Hikma", "Initials": "AH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bulgaria", "MedlineTA": "Folia Med (Plovdiv)", "NlmUniqueID": "2984761R", "ISSNLinking": "0204-8043"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abelmoschus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin-Secreting Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33650396", "10.3897/folmed.63.e51944"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
