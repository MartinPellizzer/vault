However, the mechanisms by which insulin might exert a hypertensive effect are not fully resolved. An endogenous sodium pump inhibitor or digitalis-like factor (DLF) has been proposed as a hypertensive agent and its plasma concentrations are elevated in hypertension and in Type II diabetes, where insulin levels are elevated. Hence, we studied the effect of insulin on DLF using two approaches to achieve hyperinsulinemia. Normotensive men and women underwent a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min insulin, 40 mU = 1.6 x 10(-6) g) in which plasma insulin concentration was kept at high, but physiologic levels. Serum DLF (measured as inhibition of [Na,K]ATPase activity) and insulin levels were measured at baseline and every 30 min throughout the 2 hr clamp. Additionally, other subjects underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as a second means of increasing insulin levels. Insulin and DLF levels were measured prior to and hourly for 3 hours after receiving 100 gm of oral glucose. Serum DLF increased significantly during the clamp from a baseline of 4.6 +/- 0.81 to a peak of 8.7 +/- 1.2% inhibition (p=0.001). Comparison of the baseline and peak DLF levels with concomitant plasma insulin levels revealed a significant correlation (R=0.60, p=0.003). During the OGTT, DLF levels rose from a baseline of 2.4 +/- 1.0 to a peak level of 5.0 +/- 0.4%, p = 0.04. These results suggest that DLF, a factor that can cause vascular smooth muscle contraction and potentially influence blood pressure, is increased by hyperinsulinemia and provides a mechanism by which insulin may increase blood pressure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carroll", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seely", "ForeName": "E W", "Initials": "EW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Q F", "Initials": "QF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Graves", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "M01 RR02635", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Clamp Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperinsulinism"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11487094", "10.1016/s0024-3205(01)01176-6", "S0024320501011766"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
