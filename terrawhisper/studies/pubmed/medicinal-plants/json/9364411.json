Treatment of control rats with the extract at oral doses of 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0 g kg-1 did not significantly affect the concentration of glucose, insulin or glucagon for up to 4 h after administration of the extract. The same doses in diabetic rats reduced the glucose level 1 h (2 and 4 g kg-1) and 2 h (4 g kg-1) after administration of the extract. This was accompanied by significant increases in insulin concentration 1, 2 and 4h after administration of the extract at doses of 2 and 4 g kg-1. Glibenclamide (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) dose-dependently reduced glucose and glucagon levels, and increased that of insulin in normal and diabetic rats. Simultaneous treatment of normal and diabetic rats with the plant extract (0.5, 2.0 and 5.0 g kg-1) and glibenclamide (5.0 mg kg-1) significantly exacerbated the effects on glucose, insulin and glucagon induced by the extract or by glibenclamide when given separately. When the plant extract was given at doses of 0.5, 2 and 4 g kg-1 per day for 6 consecutive days the glucose level was reduced by approximately 6, 8 and 30%, respectively. No significant effect was seen on the levels of cholesterol or protein. These results imply that co-administration of the extract with glibenclamide might adversely interfere with glycaemic control in diabetic patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert and Marine Environment Research Centre, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-92-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucagon"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SX6K58TVWC", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyburide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glucagon"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glyburide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9364411", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06032.x"]}}]}
