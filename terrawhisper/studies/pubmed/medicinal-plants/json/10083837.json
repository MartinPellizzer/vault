In this paper, we present evidence that emodin, an anthraquinone derivative, selectively inhibits casein kinase II (CKII), a Ser/Thr kinase, as a competitive inhibitor. The results with ethyl acetate extracts of the rhizomes of Rheum palmatum showed that emodin significantly inhibited the activity of cyclin B/cdc2 protein kinase (cdc2). We measured IC50 values for emodin on the activities of several Ser/Thr protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), cdc2, casein kinases I (CKI) and CKII. Interestingly, emodin inhibited CKII activity with an IC50 value of 2 microM, which was two to three orders of magnitude lower than those against the other kinases. Enzyme kinetic assays showed that emodin inhibited CKII activity as a competitive inhibitor against ATP with a Ki value of 7.2 microM. Collectively, we suggest that emodin is a selective CKII inhibitor, whose action mechanism is mediated through competitively binding to the ATP binding site."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Korea."}], "LastName": "Yim", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Casein Kinase II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KA46RNI6HN", "NameOfSubstance": "Emodin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Casein Kinase II"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Emodin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10083837", "10.1055/s-1999-13953"]}}]}
