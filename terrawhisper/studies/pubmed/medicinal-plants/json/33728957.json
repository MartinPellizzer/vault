In June 2020, symptoms of dried-shrink disease were first observed on fruits of A. trifoliata grown in Zhangjiajie, China (110.2\u00b0E, 29.4\u00b0N) with an incidence about 10%. The infected fruits were shrunken, colored in dark brown, and withered to death (Figure S1A, B). The symptomatic fruits tissues (6 \u00d7 6 mm) were excised from three individual plants, surface-disinfested in 1% NaOCl for 30s and 70% ethanol solution for 45s, washed, dried, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 50 mg/L streptomycin sulfate in the dark, and incubated at 25\u2103 for 3 days. Subsequently, hyphal tips were transferred to PDA to obtain pure cultures. After 7 days, five pure cultures were obtained, including two identical to previously reported Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causing leaf anthracnose in A. trifoliata (Pan et al. 2020) and three unknown isolates (ZJJ-C1-1, ZJJ-C1-2, and ZJJ-C1-3). The mycelia of ZJJ-C1-1, ZJJ-C1-2 and ZJJ-C1-3 were white, and formed colonies of approximate 70 mm (diameter) in size at 25\u2103 after 7 days on potato sucrose agar (PSA) plates (Figure S1C). After 25 days, conidia were formed, solitary, globose, black, shiny, smooth, and 16-21 \u03bcm in size (average diameter = 18.22 \u00b1 1.00 \u03bcm, n = 20) (Figure S1D). These morphological characteristics were similar to those of N. sphaerica previously reported (Li et al. 2018). To identify species of ZJJ-C1-1, ZJJ-C1-2 and ZJJ-C1-3, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2), and the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-\u03b1) were amplified using primer pairs including ITS1/ITS4 (Vilgalys and Hester 1990), Bt-2a/Bt-2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and EF1-728F/EF-2 (Zhou et al. 2015), respectively. Multiple sequence analyses showed no nucleotide difference was detected among genes tested except ITS that placed three isolates into two groups (Figure S2). BLAST analyses determined that ZJJ-C1-1, ZJJ-C1-2 and ZJJ-C1-3 had 99.73% to N. sphaerica strains LC2705 (KY019479), 100% to LC7294 (KY019397), and 99.79-100% to LC7294 (KX985932) or LC7294 (KX985932) based on sequences of TUB2 (MW252168, MW269660, MW269661), TEF-1\u03b1 (MW252169, MW269662, MW269663), and ITS (MW250235, MW250236, MW192897), respectively. These indicated three isolates belong to the same species of N. sphaerica. Based on a combined dataset of ITS, TUB2 and TEF-1\u03b1 sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using Maximum likelihood method through IQ-TREE (Minh et al. 2020) and confirmed that three isolates were N. sphaerica (Figure S2). Further, pathogenicity tests were performed. Briefly, healthy unwounded fruits were surface-disinfected in 0.1% NaOCl for 30s, washed, dried and needling-wounded. Then, three fruits were inoculated with 10 \u03bcl of conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/ml) derived from three individual isolates, with another three fruits sprayed with 10 \u03bcl sterilized water as control. The treated fruits were incubated at 25\u2103 in 90% humidity. After 15 days, all the three fruits inoculated with conidia displayed typical dried-shrink symptoms as those observed in the farm field (Figure S1E). The decayed tissues with mycelium and spores could be observed on the skin or vertical split of the infected fruits after 15 days' inoculation (Figure S1F-H). Comparably, in the three control fruits, there were no dried-shrink-related symptoms displayed. The experiment was repeated twice. The re-isolated pathogens were identical to N. sphaerica determined by sequencing the ITS, TUB2 and TEF-1\u03b1. Previous reports showed N. sphaerica could cause postharvest rot disease in kiwifruits (Li et al. 2018). To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. sphaerica causing fruits dried-shrink disease in A. trifoliata in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology, 558979, Hefei, Anhui, China; hongxiujing@comingnet.cn."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Xiujing", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology, 558979, Hefei, Anhui, China; 250822202@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shijia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan University, 12530, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; wlinchao@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Linchao", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan University, 12530, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 376014551@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan University, 12530, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; 2803030083@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuruo", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology, 558979, Hefei, China; 31945038@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xiaofeng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology, Tunxi road 193, Hefei, Anhui, China, 230009."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Bio-resource and Eco-environment, College of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Hydraulics and Mountain River Engineering,Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China, 610064; liuyongsheng1122@hfut.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yong Sheng", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hefei University of Technology, 558979, NO. 193 TUNXI ROAD, BAOHE QU, HEFEI, Hefei, ANHUI, China, 230009; huangshengxiong@163.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Shengxiong", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33728957", "10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2471-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
