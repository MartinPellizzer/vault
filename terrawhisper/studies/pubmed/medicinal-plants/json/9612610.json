Hence, neoplastic cells have elevated activity of enzymes responsible for glycolysis. Echitamine chloride, an indole alkaloid extracted from the bark of Alstonia scholaris, has been reported to have a highly promising anticancer activity against fibrosarcoma in rats. In the present study, the effect of echitamine chloride on energy metabolism of S-180 cells is investigated to have a better understanding on the mode of action of echitamine chloride. The effect of echitamine chloride on the mitochondrial and cellular respiration of S-180 cells was studied. Also, the effects on glucose utilization, pyruvate utilization and lactate formation were studied on whole S-180 cells and S-180 cell-free homogenate. The levels of glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase were estimated in which particular emphasis has been laid on hexokinase which occurs both in cytosolic and particulate forms in neoplastic cells. Hence the differential effect of echitamine chloride on the levels of total, cytosolic and particulate hexokinase has been investigated. In conclusion, echitamine chloride affects both cellular and mitochondrial respiration, leading to reduction of the cellular energy pool and thereby resulting in the loss of viability of S-180 cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Madras, India."}], "LastName": "Saraswathi", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramamoorthy", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Subramaniam", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mathuram", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gunasekaran", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Govindasamy", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chemotherapy", "NlmUniqueID": "0144731", "ISSNLinking": "0009-3157"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OTH5TH48VK", "NameOfSubstance": "echitamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Respiration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma 180"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9612610", "10.1159/000007115", "che44198"]}}]}
