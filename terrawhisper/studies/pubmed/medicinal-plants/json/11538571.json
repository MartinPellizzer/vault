Walp] for future use in a space-deployed Controlled Ecological Life Support System. Cowpea breeding line IT87D-941-1 was grown at plant densities of 3.6, 7.2, 10.7, or 14.3 plants m-2 in a growth chamber maintained at 400 (control) or 1200 (elevated) micromoles CO2 mol-1. Both green leaves and dried seeds were harvested as edible yield. Crop productivity was measured by edible yield rate (EYR), harvest index (HI), yield efficiency rate (YER), energy efficiency, and net photosynthesis (Pn). Increasing plant density within a canopy tended to increase EYR, but decreased HI and YER. Elevated CO2 also increased EYR, but decreased HI and YER as well. However, when the energy penalty for crop production was taken into consideration, cowpea crops grown under elevated CO2 were more productive than those grown at control CO2. Pn averaged 15 micromoles CO2 m-2 s-1 for cowpeas grown at 400 micromoles CO2 mol-1. Low Pn at the beginning and end of the cropping cycle indicated waste of high irradiance lighting during those times."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NASA Specialized Center of Research and Training in Bioregenerative Life Support, Department of Horticulture, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1165, USA."}], "LastName": "Ohler", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitchell", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Life Support Biosph Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9431217", "ISSNLinking": "1069-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecological Systems, Closed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroponics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Support Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11538571"]}}]}
