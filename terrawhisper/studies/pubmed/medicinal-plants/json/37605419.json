ALP (2 mg/kg oral administration) and control groups received Curcumin and nanoCurcumin (oral administration 100 mg/kg ( or without it. After seven days of treatment, kidney parameters, oxidative stress biomarkers, and expression level of sirtuins1 (SIRT1)/Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) pathway genes were evaluated in kidney tissue. In addition, histopathological changes in the kidney tissues were assayed.", "In the ALP group, compared to the control group, lipid peroxidation levels, urea, and creatinine were increased, and total antioxidant capacity and thiol groups decreased significantly P<0.05. In Curcumin and nanoCurcumin groups compared to the ALP group, lipid peroxidation and creatinine decreased significantly P<0.05. Also, Curcumin and nanoCurcumin improved the tissue damage caused by ALP. NanoCurcumin modulated the effect of ALP on the gene expression levels in SIRT1/FoxO1.", "The present study showed that ALP intoxication in kidney tissue can induce oxidative damage. Moreover, Curcumin and nanocurcumin, as potential antioxidants, can be effective therapeutics in ALP-induced nephrotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Abadan School of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, \u200eIran."}], "LastName": "Motevali Manesh", "ForeName": "Seyde Farnaz", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kheiripour", "ForeName": "Nejat", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anatomy Departments, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Irann."}], "LastName": "Asl", "ForeName": "Sara Soleimani", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, \u200eIran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USERN office, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jouzdani", "ForeName": "Ali Fathi", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Recombinant Proteins Department, Breast Cancer Research Center, Motamed Cancer Institute, ACECR, Tehran 1517964311, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolvahab", "ForeName": "Mohadeseh Haji", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101623431", "ISSNLinking": "2211-7385"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37605419", "10.2174/2211738511666230821124704", "PNT-EPUB-133878"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
