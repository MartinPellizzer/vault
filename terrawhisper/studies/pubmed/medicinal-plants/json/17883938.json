Cardiac-specific sarcomeric proteins (ie alpha-actinin, troponin T) were evaluated when embryoid bodies (EB) were treated with icariin or retinoid acid. The expression of PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, and NRF-1 were analyzed using both semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting in cardiomyocyte differentiation. The phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was studied in the differentiation process, and its specific inhibitor SB203580 was employed to confirm the function of the p38 MAPK on icariin-induced cardiac differentiation.", "The application of icariin significantly induced the cardiomyocyte differentiation of EB as indicated by the promoted expression of alpha-actinin and troponin T. The expression of PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, and NRF-1 increased coincidently in early differentiation and the increase was dose-dependently upregulated by icariin treatment. The phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK peaked on d 6 and decreased after d 8, and the activation was further enhanced and prolonged when the EB were subjected to icariin, which was concurrent with the elevation of PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, and NRF-1. Moreover, the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway by SB203580 efficiently abolished icariin-stimulated cardiomyocyte differentiation and resulted in the capture of the upregulation of PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, and NRF-1.", "Taken together, icariin promoted the expression of PGC-1alpha, PPARalpha, and NRF-1 during cardiomyocyte differentiation of murine ES cells in vitro and the effect was partly responsible for the activation of the p38 MAPK."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Biochemical Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Xing-Guang", "Initials": "XG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Dan-Yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lou", "ForeName": "Yi-Jia", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nrf1 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ppargc1a protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trans-Activators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OU13V1EYWQ", "NameOfSubstance": "SB 203580"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VNM47R2QSQ", "NameOfSubstance": "icariin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Embryonic Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trans-Activators"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17883938", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2007.00648.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
