The youngest in the group was 14 and the oldest 46. 84 were multipara and the 47 were primipara. 127 women, 95.5% of all the cases, had successful abortion including 85.8% who used Yuanhuacine once. The time span between the drug administration and the start of uterine contraction averaged 7.5 hours with the shortest 35 minutes and the longest 26 hours. The time span to the expulsion of the embryos averaged 23.5 hours ranging from 4 to 60 hours. Expulsion of placenta was recorded in 127 cases, in which 83 had complete expulsion, 39 had partial expulsion and 5 had placenta retained in the uterus. The embryos and placenta of 30 cases were studied. Bleeding and swelling was observed in the brain membrane and organs of internal system. The decidua cells of placenta had already died. No trauma of uterus, and no complication in the process of abortion was observed. The study results indicated that the use of Yuanhuacine film in induced abortion has a higher success rate and fewer side effects in comparison with the uterine injection of the same drug. Bleeding, trauma of uterine wall, and complication may occur in the surgical procedure of 12-16 week abortion. Using Yuanhuacine film in this period is a better alternative. The high proportion of placenta retention in the abortion procedure was due to the reason that the placenta is still immature and the separation from uterus can be difficult."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["042298", "00199569"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: REPRODUCTION AND CONTRACEPTION"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Asia", "China", "Clinical Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Eastern Asia", "Embryo", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Dynamics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, First Trimester", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Time Factors"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12341314", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1991", "Month": "05", "Day": "07"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "07"}, "Article": {"Language": ["chi"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0253-357X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "7", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1987"}}, "Title": "Sheng zhi yu bi yun = Reproduction and contraception", "ISOAbbreviation": "Shengzhi Yu Biyun"}, "ArticleTitle": "[The clinical and pathological study of induced abortion by Yuanhuacine film in 12-16 week pregnancy].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "65", "EndPage": "66", "MedlinePgn": "65-6"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Shengzhi Yu Biyun", "NlmUniqueID": "9424867", "ISSNLinking": "0253-357X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Embryo, Mammalian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Embryo, Nonmammalian"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Dynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Trimester, First"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12341314"]}}]}
