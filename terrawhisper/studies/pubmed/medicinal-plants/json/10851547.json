Ginseng water extract 500 micrograms/ml was added to the culture medium either for 48 hours prior to irradiation. Ginseng extract showed protective effect against the formation of dsb when it was treated for 48 hours before 100 Gy gamma-ray-irradiation. While repair was almost completed until 220.2 minutes after irradiation, DNA repair of irradiated cells in the presence of ginseng extract was did not return to the corresponding control levels even after 621.8 minutes. From these data, it could be calculated that ginseng reduced the relative strand scission factor (RSSF) by about 2. Therefore, it could be concluded that ginseng has radioprotective effect against gamma-ray induced DNA dsb and repair in cultured mouse lymphocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Radiation Effect, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Seoul."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yool", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Biother Radiopharm", "NlmUniqueID": "9605408", "ISSNLinking": "1084-9785"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10851547", "10.1089/cbr.1996.11.267"]}}]}
