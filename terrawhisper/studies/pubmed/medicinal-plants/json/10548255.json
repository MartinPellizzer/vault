Given acutely at single oral doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 g/kg, the extract produced dose-dependent decreases in total activity and ambulatory activity. Diazepam (20 mg/kg, orally) produced a decrease in rat activity comparable to that produced by a dose of 1 g/kg of the extract. When given daily at an oral dose of 2 g/kg for 21 consecutive days, the extract produced, on the last day of treatment, significant decrease in activity amounting to about 30% of control activity levels. Subcutaneous (SC) treatment of rats with caffeine (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg), dose-dependently and significantly increased total activity and ambulatory activity. These effects were dose-dependently attenuated when the extract was given concomitantly with caffeine at oral doses of 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg. Treatment of rats with zoxazolamine alone (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg, SC) or R. Stricta (1 and 4 g/kg orally) alone significantly decreased total and ambulatory activities. Concomitant treatment with zoxazolamine and R. Stricta decreased the rats activity to a greater degree than with either treatment given alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert and Marine Environment Research Centre, University of the United Arab Emirates, Al-Ain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bashir", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tanira", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Biochem Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0367050", "ISSNLinking": "0091-3057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Stimulants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Muscle Relaxants, Central"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DOW362Q29", "NameOfSubstance": "Zoxazolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q3JTX2Q7TU", "NameOfSubstance": "Diazepam"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Stimulants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diazepam"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Relaxants, Central"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zoxazolamine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10548255", "10.1016/s0091-3057(99)00099-4", "S0091-3057(99)00099-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
