Effect of 2,4-D, IAA, IBA and NAA was examined on cell growth and berberine production. Berberine was synthesized and released continuously into the liquid medium. Presence of 2,4-D stimulated cell growth, but was not inhibitory on berberine synthesis. On the contrary, NAA stimulated berberine biosynthesis, but was not favourable for cell growth. Among the auxins tested, highest yield of berberine (5.79 mg/30 ml; 4.14 times to that of control) was obtained with 4 mg/l of NAA, while the best cell growth (214.43 mg dry wt., 1.96 times to that of control) was observed in the presence of 2 mg/l of 2,4-D. IAA and IBA were not favourable for cell growth and berberine synthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Kerala, Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram, 695 581, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Narasimhan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthaleneacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "061SKE27JP", "NameOfSubstance": "indolebutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2577AQ9262", "NameOfSubstance": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthaleneacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15260115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
