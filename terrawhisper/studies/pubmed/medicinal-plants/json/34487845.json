Found primarily in the African countries (Kenya, Tanzania, Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria), Asian countries (India and Afghanistan), European countries (Italy), and also in other countries like Brazil and Austria. These plants are commonly cultivated as a vegetable crop for their nutritional benefits, and the leaves are widely consumed for their health-promoting effects. The different parts of the plants, such as leaves, seeds, flowers, and roots, are used to treat acute and chronic inflammatory disorders, hepatotoxicity, malaria, fungal diseases, and cancer.", "Detailed investigations in underlining the molecular mechanisms and their wide variety of effects in treating various diseases remain ambiguous. The review focuses on an in-depth discussion of studies targeting phytochemistry and polypharmacology. Thus, the review aims to recapitulate the therapeutic potential of the components of Cleome involved in the treatment of a wide variety of ailments from ancient times were collected and presented along with strategies aiming for future studies.", "The information provided is collected from several scientific databases (PubMed, Elsevier, ScienceDirect) and traditional medicine books, and other professional websites.", "Investigations and current evidence revealed that the different chemical constituents present in cleome species possess various health-promoting effects along with the aerial parts showing promising traditional uses in traditional healing and culinary.
