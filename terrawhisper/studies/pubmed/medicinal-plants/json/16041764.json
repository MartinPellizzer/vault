The lipoxygenase enzymes are classed into several subcategories including 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenases. The 5-lipoxygenase pathway has been the major focus of study due to the pronounced pro-inflammatory role of leukotrienes and the approval of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and leukotriene receptor antagonists for the clinical treatment of asthma. Although less well characterized, the 12-lipoxygenase as well as the 15-lipoxygenase pathway may also play an important role in the progression of human diseases such as cancer, psoriasis and atherosclerosis. The present review article summarizes the findings from an extensive literature search on plants that have been assessed for 12- and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity as well as for leukotriene receptor antagonistic properties. The results are presented in a tabular format, and a discussion about promising plant species and natural compounds as well as relevant in vitro assays are included in this article."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, Karl-Franzens-University, Graz, Austria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schneider", "ForeName": "Isabella", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bucar", "ForeName": "Franz", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leukotriene Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Asthmatic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukotriene Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "50"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16041764", "10.1002/ptr.1604"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
