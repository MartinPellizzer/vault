The detailed karyotype of C. chorassanicum was also investigated for the first time. A 12 h cold water pretreatment and 13 min 60 degrees C 1 N HCl hydrolysis confirmed a somatic chromosome number of 2n = 16 in all the species. Within species interchromosomal size variation was observed to be quite large in C. arietinum, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, but not in the remaining six species. Individual chromosome size ranged from 3.77 microns in C. echinospermum to 1.32 microns in C. arietinum while the haploid genome length ranged from 20.65 microns in C. echinospermum to 14.92 microns in C. cuneatum. Ample rearrangement of chromatin among chromosomes within a species was implied to have played a role in Cicer genome evolution. The nine species were classified in two groups based on karyotypic similarity, with the first group comprising the inter-crossable species C. arietinum, C. reticulatum and C. echinospermum, while the remaining species forming the second group. The first group species are also genetically close to each other as deduced by other morphological, biochemical and DNA based studies. Circumstantial evidence has lead to the speculation that perhaps karyotypic similarity and interspecific crossability are positively related to each other."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Brandon University, Manitoba, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Satellite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterochromatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Centromere"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Satellite"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Heterochromatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Karyotyping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10697744"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
