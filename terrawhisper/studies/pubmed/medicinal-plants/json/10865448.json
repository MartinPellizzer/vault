Hederagenin and its monodesmosides, kalopanaxsaponin A and I in addition to its bisdesmosides, kalopanaxsaponin B and H, showed potent antimutagenic activities against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). However, they had no inhibitory effects on mutagenicity induced by the direct mutagen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). This suggested that hederagenin glycosides might effectively prevent the metabolic activation of AFB1 or scavenge the electrophilic intermediate capable of inducing mutation. Hederagenin was found to be an essential moiety for the exhibition of antimutagenicity. Moreover, hederagenin and its 3-O-glycosides were found to be cytotoxic on various tumor cell lines, P-388, L-1210, U-937, HL-60, SNU-5 and HepG2, while 3,28-di-O-glycosides of hederagenin were not cytotoxic. Hence, hederagenin and its 3-O-glycosides could be suitable for cancer treatment chemopreventive drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Seoul, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "I C", "Initials": "IC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "G O", "Initials": "GO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "K Y", "Initials": "KY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RQF57J8212", "NameOfSubstance": "hederagenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10865448", "10.1055/s-2000-8539"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
