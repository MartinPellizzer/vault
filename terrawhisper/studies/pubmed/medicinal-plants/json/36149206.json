There have been numerous efforts to control the population of pathogenic agents in the oral cavity, including the usage of natural phytochemicals obtained from medicinal plants. Nasturtium officinale has long been used in traditional medicine for the management of hypertension, respiratory infections, and hyperglycemia, and its effectiveness against some microbes has been reported.", "To evaluate antimicrobial properties of a hydro-alcoholic extract of N. officinale against common oral pathogens namely Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Experimental laboratory study. Different dilutions of N. officinale hydro-alcoholic extract were the test solutions, the positive control was a bacterial suspension in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, whereas the negative control was the herbal extract only, without any bacterial inoculation. Hydro-alcoholic extract of N. officinale prepared in five different concentrations (105, 52.5, 26.25, 13.12, 6.56 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup>) was tested separately against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus in a test of microdilution assay. Spectrophotometry was used to assess bacterial growth after 24 and 48 h.", "The data of optical absorbance reads from spectrophotometry were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis followed by Least Significant Differences (LSD) post hoc.", "The highest growth inhibitory effect against S. mutans, E. faecalis, and S. aureus was observed at a concentration of 13.12 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup>; for L. acidophilus and P. aeruginosa, the most significant inhibition was observed at a concentration of 105 mg.mL<sup>-1</sup>.", "N. officinale extract effectively inhibited the growth of the tested oral bacteria at different concentrations but was more effective against S. mutans, E. faecalis, and S. aureus and so may be effective in managing some oral microbial infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Research Center, Dental Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabesh", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dental Implants Research Center, Dental Research Institute, School of Dentistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sh", "ForeName": "M Etemadi", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Etemadi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naddaf", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental Research Center, Dental Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Healthcare Industry Innovation, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei City; School of Nursing, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Taipei 112, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Alizargar", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Niger J Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101150032"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enterococcus faecalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nasturtium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus mutans"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36149206", "10.4103/njcp.njcp_1887_21", "NigerJClinPract_2022_25_9_1466_356665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
