Leaves were fixed in different fixing solutions containing absolute alcohol (99.99%), chloroform and EDTA, but without liquid nitrogen. DNA quality and quantity obtained were comparable to those isolated with liquid nitrogen, as the lambda260/lambda280 ratio with liquid nitrogen was in range 1.3-1.7 and with other fixing solutions it was 1.1-1.5. Absolute alcohol showed best results as fixing solution. Good quality of DNA was isolated without using liquid nitrogen from different medicinal plant species. DNA isolated by this method was suitable for various molecular biology applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Banasthali University, Banasthali 304 022, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Pratibha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Neha", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Anubhuti", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freezing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20882764"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
