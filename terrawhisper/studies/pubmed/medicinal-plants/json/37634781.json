Firstly, based on results of printing properties and fresh-keeping of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L-surimi, it showed better printing effects (enhanced mechanical strength) and good preservation (inhibition of amino acids decomposition, bacterial growth). However, freshness changes of printed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NS-L-surimi were not distinguished directly. To avoid that, 4D printable color-changing material-anthocyanin-hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose-xanthan gum-carrageenan (AHXK) was prepared for indicating freshness through discoloration. Printing results showed AHX with 5\u00a0%\u00a0K had the most suitable mechanical strength (appropriate gel strength, texture, rheology) for printing. Based on that, AHXK had stable color (\u0394E fluctuation <5) and was sensitive to pH and ammonia (obvious discoloration; \u0394E\u00a0>\u00a010). Actual freshness monitoring results (co-printing of AHXK-surimi) exhibited significant discolorations, especially for HXK with 0.75\u00a0% A. It became green during refrigeration of 3-5 d (keeping fresh, \u0394E\u00a0<\u00a04), brighter green at 7 d (decreased freshness, \u0394E\u00a0>\u00a06), turned yellow at 9 d (spoilage, \u0394E\u00a0>\u00a016), which were distinguished significantly with naked eyes rather than traditional freshness determining. In conclusion, printed AHXK-functional surimi exhibited good printing, preservation and nondestructive freshness monitoring, facilitating application of 3D printed functional surimi."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
