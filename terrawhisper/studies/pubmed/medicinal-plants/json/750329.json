Fr. [C-2] had the most potent anti-ulcer effects of all fractions extracted. Sophoradin and sophoranone which were isolated from Fr. [C-2] were also found to have inhibitory effects on ulcer formation in pylorus ligated and stressed rats. The anti-ulcer effect of sophoradin was relatively potent in comparison with that of sophoranone and/or Fr. [C-2]. The anti-ulcer effect of sophoranone was approximately the same as that of Fr. [C-2]. The authors examined the effects of sophoradin and sophoranone on gastric secretion in pylorus ligated rats. Sophoradin and sophoranone significantly reduced the volume of gastric juice. Sophoradin but not sophoranone inhibited the free and total acid output of gastric juice. The effect of sophoradin was examined on various secretagogues which induced gastric secretions in rats with acute fistula. Sophoradin showed a tendency to inhibit tetragastrin- and insulin-induced gastric acid secretion, but there were no effects on methacholine- and histamine-induced secretions. These results suggest that sophoradin may have marked anti-ulcer and inhibitory effects on gastric secretion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasajima", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakane", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saziki", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saotome", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hatayama", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kyogoku", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propiophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Fistula"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Juice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propiophenones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pylorus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["750329", "10.1254/fpj.74.897"]}}]}
