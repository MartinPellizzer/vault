This study investigates the free radical scavenging activity of various Telfairia occidentalis leaves extracts in relation to their inhibitory effects on lipid peroxidation. The extracts markedly exhibited antioxidants activity especially the ethyl acetate (EE) and chloroform (CE) extract which scavenged 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryhydraxyl (DPPH) radicals significantly (p<0.05) by 76.34 and 76.62% respectively at 600\u03bc/ml with minimum effects (53.34%) obtained with the methanol (ME) extract. Similarly the extracts scavenged iron/EDTA/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced hydroxyl radical formation in a dose-dependent manner as the ME, EE and CE extracts scavenged the radicals at 300\u00b5g/ml by 40.55, 24.23 and 19.64% respectively. Interestingly, ME, EE and CE extracts inhibited iron-induced lipid per oxidation significantly (P<0.05) by 93.56, 76.24 and 70.54% respectively at 300\u00b5g/ml. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of phenols and flavonoids at 2.58, 1.98, 3.24 and 0.840, 0.300, 0.400mg/g garlic acid and quercetin equivalence at 300 \u03bcg/ml concentrations respectively. Bioactive constituents of the leaves extracts shows antioxidants potentials, radical scavenging and inhibitory effects on lipid per oxidation which were highly expressed in methanol extract and may be a template for drug discovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Ladoke Akintola, University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Temitope", "ForeName": "Adedosu Olaniyi", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Ladoke Akintola, University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Emmanuel", "ForeName": "Adeleke Gbadebo", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science, Laboratory Technology (Biochemistry Unit), Ladoke Akintola,University of Technology, Ogbomoso Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akintola", "ForeName": "Adebola Olayemi", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Ladoke Akintola, University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Olabode", "ForeName": "Fatoki John", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Ladoke Akintola, University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Isaac", "ForeName": "Adelusi Temitope", "Initials": "AT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "39R4TAN1VT", "NameOfSubstance": "ferrous sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ferrous Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29618448"]}}]}
