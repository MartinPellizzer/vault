It is a resinous and dioecious plant and is a medicinal plant commonly used in Mexico. Its curative properties are: cholesterol lowering, anti-inflammatory, antiulcerous agent. The collection site is in Barranca Honda, Morelos, Mexico. Three samplings were made during the research period. A decortication of four trees per sex was carried out. An additional collection of resin was made during the last sampling, in order to verify the presence of the compounds of interest. Masticadienonic, alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic and masticadienonic/isomasticadienonic acid mixtures were isolated and identified. Major accumulations of masticadienonic, alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acids and masticadienonic/isomasticadienonic acid mixtures were related to female plants and a mixture of alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid and an unknown compound with male plants. Major accumulation of masticadienonic acid occurred in February, and alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic was mainly found in November. An anti-inflammatory test with the alpha-hydroxymasticadienonic acid was made and strong inhibition of the inflammation was observed in a preliminary test."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Colegio de Posgraduados, Montecillo, Edo. de Mexico, Mexico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Olivera Ortega", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soto Hern\u00e1ndez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez V\u00e1zquez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Terrazas Salgado", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Solares Arenas", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10624869", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00047-1", "S0378-8741(99)00047-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
