Because of the diverse habitats found in the region, from mountains to deep valleys, the complex ecosystem of the highland Maya is the world's third richest in numbers of vascular plant species. The rain forests of this area are a rich source of potential new drugs. According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, more than 25% of the ingredients in today's cancer medicines were either discovered in rain forests or are analogues or derivatives of such compounds. Although much of the Mayan medical knowledge continues to be practiced by their descendants, the Mayan medical traditions are fading because of increased urbanization. Meanwhile, the source of their pharmacopeia is disappearing as the tropical rain forests are cleared for development. Consequently, measures to preserve this pharmaceutical knowledge are of great importance."], "CopyrightInformation": "(c) 2004 Prous Science.
