According to WHO 75% people rely on traditional medicines for the prevention and cure of different ailments. Similarly, the majority of the world population use a number of plants to treat problems related to the urinary tract system in which urolithiasis is the major cause. The aim of the review is to collect the data of the plants used in different parts and cultures of the world against urolithiasis with their parts, mode of preparation, dosage and administration. A literature review was conducted for traditionally used antiurolithiatic plants. The articles mentioning plant, parts, mode of preparation, dose and route of administration were selected. This information was extracted to compose Mono and Poly herbal antiurolithiatic formulations used in Appalachia (region in Eastern United States), Canada, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Latin America, Pakistan, Turkey and Yemen. The review provides an important data about plants used as antiurolithiatic in different parts of the world. The information not only useful for common people, but also for the scientific community to carry out further phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological studies for the discovery of new, effective and safer molecules against urolithiasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Salman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hasan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Mohtasheemul", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Colorcon Limited UK, Flagship House, Victory Way, Crossways, Dartford, Kent, DA26 QD-England."}], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Zafar Alam", "Initials": "ZA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Urological Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cultural Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urolithiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Urological Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28375136"]}}]}
