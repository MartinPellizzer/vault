Regression equations revealed linear relationships (correlation coefficient 0.9986-0.9990) between the corrected peak area (the ratio of peak area to migration time) of each constituent and its concentration. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the migration time and peak area were 1.45-1.52 and 2.60-3.84% (intra-day), and 1.75-2.22 and 2.90-4.04% (inter-day), respectively. The recoveries of three constituents ranged between 94.5 and 105.6%. The effects of pH value, buffer concentration and applied voltage on the migration behavior of HC, HMC and GC were investigated. The contents of the three active constituents in the flower of Cacalia tangutica were successfully determined within 6 min under the optimum conditions chosen. Moreover, the dissociation constants for three coumarins were also determined by CE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine of Gansu Province, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yue", "ForeName": "Mei-E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ting-Fu", "Initials": "TF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15627276", "10.1002/bmc.451"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
