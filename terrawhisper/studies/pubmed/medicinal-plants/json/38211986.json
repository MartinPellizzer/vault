Cannabinoid type 2 receptor(CB2R) belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family and is widely distributed in immune cells, peripheral tissues, and the central nervous system. It plays a role in inflammatory responses under various pathological conditions. The down-regulation of CB2R activity is an important marker of inflammation and and CB2R modulators have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study explored the relationship between CB2R and inflammatory responses, delved into its regulatory mechanisms in inflammatory diseases, and summarized the research progress on CB2R modulators from plants other than cannabis, including plant extracts and monomeric compounds, in exerting anti-inflammatory effects. The aim is to provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311402, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Chen-Xia", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311402, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Si-Jing", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311402, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiao-Yan", "Initials": "QY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311402, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qi-Ming", "Initials": "QM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311402, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Lu-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fuyang Research Institute, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 311422, China School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Hangzhou 310053, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Wan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cannabinoid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cannabinoid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38211986", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230927.601"]}}]}
