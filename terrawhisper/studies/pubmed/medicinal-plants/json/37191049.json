The fungus <i>Candida albicans</i> causes vaginal infection known as vulvovaginal candidiasis, a highly prevalent and recurrent gynaecological disease among women. Vaginal candidiasis affects over 75% of women at a certain point in their life and has a recurrence rate of 40-50%. Medicinal plants provide some very effective phytoconstituents which when delivered as nanosystems have enhanced therapeutic action and efficacy by alteration in their characteristics. Antifungal drugs are used to treat these conditions, alternative medicine is required for prophylaxis and improved prognosis. The current review focuses on the research carried out on various nanocarrier-based approaches and essential oil-based formulations for vaginal candidiasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3722-991X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "Poonam", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Akriti", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Pundir", "ForeName": "Swati", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1007-4997"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Parashar", "ForeName": "Arun", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Upadhyay", "ForeName": "Navneet", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9412-0788"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "L.R Institute of Pharmacy, Oachghat, Solan, 173212, India."}], "LastName": "Agarwal", "ForeName": "Shweta", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shoolini University of Biotechnology & Management Sciences, Solan, 173 212, India."}], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "Raveen", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8499-9891"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ulster University, Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, BT52 1SA, UK."}], "LastName": "Tambuwala", "ForeName": "Murtaza M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ther Deliv", "NlmUniqueID": "101538870", "ISSNLinking": "2041-5990"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vagina"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37191049", "10.4155/tde-2022-0058"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
