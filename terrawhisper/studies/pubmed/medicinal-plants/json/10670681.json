Three experiments were undertaken to determine the optimum inclusion rates of field peas, faba beans, chick peas and sweet lupins in broiler starter and finisher diets in amounts up to 360 g/kg. 2. In experiment A chickens in cages grown to 21 d on diets with field peas and faba beans gave better growth rate and feed efficiency than those with sweet lupins and chick peas. Growth rate and Food conversion ratio (FCR) improved with increasing amounts of faba beans in the diet while for chick peas growth rate and FCR declined. Digesta viscosity and excreta stickiness scores were much higher on diets with sweet lupins. Steam pelleting improved growth rate and FCR on all diets. 3. In experiment B birds were in cages and grown from 21 to 42 d. There were no differences between grain legumes (when combined for all inclusions) for growth rate, food intake or FCR. Viscosity was again much higher on the sweet lupin-based diets while the pancreas was significantly enlarged on the diets with chick peas, as observed previously in chickens grown to 21 d. Steam pelleting of diets gave a consistent and positive response for weight gain and FCR. 4. Experiment C was carried out in pens each holding 60 birds under semi-commercial conditions and grown to 42 d on starter and finisher diets with the same grain legumes as used previously but each at 2 rates of inclusion similar to those in commercial practice. Field peas at 200 to 300 g/kg and chick peas at 150 to 220 g/kg gave inferior growth to faba beans (150 to 180 g/kg) and sweet lupins (120 g/kg). 5. The results of these experiments allowed tentative recommendations to be made to industry for inclusion rates of these cultivars of the 4 grain legumes. These were: field peas 300 g/kg; faba beans 200 g/kg, chick peas 100 g/kg and sweet lupins <100 g/kg. Wet droppings and high gut viscosity were serious problems with sweet lupins although these were not so obvious in experiment C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Queensland Poultry Research and Development Centre, University of Queensland, Cleveland, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farrell", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perez-Maldonado", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mannion", "ForeName": "P F", "Initials": "PF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10670681", "10.1080/00071669987070"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
