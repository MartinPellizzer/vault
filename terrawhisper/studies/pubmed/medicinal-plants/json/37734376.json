Here, we applied quantitative mass spectrometry to profile the thermal stability of the Arabidopsis proteome and identify thermo-sensitive and thermo-resilient protein networks in Arabidopsis, providing a basis for understanding heat-induced damage. We also show that the similarities of the protein-melting curves can be used as a proxy to evaluate system-wide protein-protein interactions in non-engineered plants and enable the identification of transient interactions exhibited by metabolons in the context of the cellular environment. Finally, we report a systematic comparison of the thermal stability of paralogs in Arabidopsis to aid the investigation and understanding of gene duplication and protein evolution. Taken together, our results could have broad implications for the fields of plant thermal tolerance, plant protein assemblies, and evolution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
