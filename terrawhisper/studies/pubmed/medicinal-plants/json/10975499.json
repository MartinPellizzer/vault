The enzyme was enantiospecific for (-)-(2S)-naringenin and utilized 3,3-dimethylallyl diphosphate as sole prenyl donor. It required Mg2+ (optimum concentration, 10 mM), and has an optimum pH of 9-10. The apparent Km values for 3,3-dimethylallyl diphosphate and naringenin were 120 and 36 microM, respectively. The microsomal fraction prenylated several other flavanones at the C-8 position less effectively as compared with naringenin. Interestingly, when 2'-hydroxynaringenin was used as a prenyl acceptor, the 8-lavandulyl (sophoraflavanone G) and the 6-dimethylallyl derivatives were formed, together with the 8-dimethylallyl derivative, leachianone G. These results suggest that the 2'-hydroxy group of naringenin plays an important role for the formation of a lavandulyl group."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Gifu Pharmaceutical University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senda", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "dimethylallyl diphosphate naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkyl and Aryl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10975499", "10.1016/s0031-9422(00)00198-9", "S0031-9422(00)00198-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
