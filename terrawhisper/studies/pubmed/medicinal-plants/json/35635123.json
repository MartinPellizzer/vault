Thus, compounds that target the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 GMT (S2GMT) will enhance drug development against COVID-19. In this study, an in-house library of 249 phytochemicals from African medicinal plants was screened using computational approaches including homology modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, binding free energy calculations based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) and Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion-Toxicity (ADMET) analysis for inhibitors of S2GMT. The top-ten ranked phytochemicals (TTRP) obtained from the docking analysis to S2GMT were further docked to SARS-COV N7-MTase. Among the TTRP, the top-four ranked phytocompounds (TFRP) viz: 3 alkaloids (Isocryptolepine, 10'-Hydroxyusambarensine and Isostrychnopentamine) and a flavonoid (Mulberrofuran F) interacted strongly with critical catalytic residues whose interference either reduce or completely abolish N7-MTase activity, indicating their potential as capping machinery disruptors. The interactions of TFRP with the catalytic residues of S2GMT were preserved in a 100\u2009ns simulated dynamic environment, thereby, demonstrating high degree of structural stability. The MMPBSA binding free energy calculations corroborated the docking scores with biscryptolepine having the highest binding free energy to S2GMT. The TFRP showed favourable drug-likeness and ADMET properties over a wide range of molecular descriptors. Therefore, the TFRP can be further explored as potential S2GMT inhibitors in <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> experiments.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
