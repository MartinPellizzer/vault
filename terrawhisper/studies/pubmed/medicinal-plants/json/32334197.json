Cancer-caused deaths are expected to be 11.5 million by 2030 all over the world. Because of the fatal nature of cancer, substantial efforts are made all over the world to combat it. Phytoconstituents such as certain alkaloids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, and terpenoids exhibit anticancer effects. Sophoridine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid isolated from the stem and leaves of medicinal plants Sophora alopecuroides L., and Euchresta japonica Benth, and roots of Sophora alopecuroides Ait. Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approved sophoridine as an antitumor agent in 2005. This review covers the antitumor activities of sophoridine and its derivatives. The efficacy of sophoridine analogs is expressed with respect to their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub> values). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) study for most of the sophoridine derivatives has been explained. Moreover, the current market of anticancer drugs and its expected growth are discussed. Prospects provide suggestions and clues for novel sophoridine-based anticancer agents with enhanced expected efficacy and minimum toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
