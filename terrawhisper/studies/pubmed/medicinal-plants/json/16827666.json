One hundred and twenty dogs were diagnosed with perennial AD on the basis of history, clinical signs, a positive test for perennial allergens and elimination of other dermatoses. Exclusion criteria included antimicrobials within 7 days, antihistamines within 14 days, oral/topical glucocorticoids or ciclosporin within 28 days, and parenteral glucocorticoids, essential fatty acids or immunotherapy within 56 days. Flea control, shampoos and ear cleaners were permitted. Dogs with a minimum canine atopic dermatitis extent and severity index (CADESI) of 25 were randomly allocated to receive PYM00217 (100, 200 or 400 mg kg-1 day-1) or placebo for 12 weeks. The mean reductions in CADESI (intention-to-treat population) were 3.9% (placebo; n=29), 4.4% (100 mg kg-1 day-1; n=30), 23.4% (200 mg kg-1 day-1; n=29) and 8.5% (400 mg kg-1 day-1; n=29). The reduction in the 200 mg kg-1 day-1 group was significant (P<0.01). For dogs with a baseline CADESI>or=50, the mean changes were +10.6% (placebo; n=12), +0.6% (100 mg kg-1 day-1; n=14), -29.3% (200 mg kg-1 day-1; n=14) and -3.4% (400 mg kg-1 day-1; n=15). The 200 mg kg-1 day-1 dose was significantly more effective than placebo (P=0.038). No serious adverse effects were reported. Minor adverse effects seen in 10% (placebo and 100 mg kg-1 day-1), 24% (200 mg kg-1 day-1) and 42% (400 mg kg-1 day-1) of cases were mainly minor gastrointestinal disorders and only five cases required cessation of dosing. Two dogs (one in each of the 100 mg kg-1 day-1 and 200 mg kg-1 day-1 groups) refused to eat the medicated food. In conclusion, PYM00217 at 200 mg kg-1 appears to be an effective, palatable and well-tolerated treatment for canine AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Royal Veterinary College, North Mymms, Hertfordshire, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferguson", "ForeName": "Ewan A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Littlewood", "ForeName": "Janet D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carlotti", "ForeName": "Didier-No\u00ebl", "Initials": "DN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "Rob", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nuttall", "ForeName": "Tim", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Vet Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "9426187", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4493"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PYM 00217"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dog Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16827666", "10.1111/j.1365-3164.2006.00523.x", "VDE523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
