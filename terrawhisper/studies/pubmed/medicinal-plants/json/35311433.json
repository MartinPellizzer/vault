The increase in resistance in known fungal pathogens to the available anti-fungal drugs and side effects are the important demands that forced to search anti-fungal compounds from medicinal plants as therapeutic alternatives. During the fishing expedition, <i>Piper betle</i> L., gets tremendous attention for its rich source of medicinally important compounds. Among them, hydroxychavicol has the enormous supportive records against microbial growth.", "Hydroxychavicol and the chosen drugs were retrieved from the Pubchem database and subjected to ADME analysis.
