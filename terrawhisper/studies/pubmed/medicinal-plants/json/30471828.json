In this study, we synthesized and analyzed several new alkylamide derivatives of racemocin B, a natural indolo[3,2-a]carbazole molecule originally isolated from the green alga Caulerpa racemose. Several alkylamide derivatives were found to exhibit moderate to strong growth inhibition against human breast cancer cell lines. They induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Among these derivatives, compound 25 with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> induced cell death by suppressing autophagy. This was accompanied by inhibition of autophagic flux and accumulation of autophagy protein 1 light chain 3, LC3II, and p62. The novel alkylamide derivative offers a potential new treatment for human breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
