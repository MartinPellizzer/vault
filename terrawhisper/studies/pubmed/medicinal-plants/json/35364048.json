Currently, the only drug available for the treatment of this disease is praziquantel, which has low efficacy against immature helminth stages and there are reports of drug resistance. In this study, the chemical composition and the in vitro effect of essential oils (EOs) and major compounds from Lippia gracilis and Lippia alba against schistosomula and adult Schistosoma mansoni worms were evaluated. Adult S. mansoni worms cultured for 8h in the presence of L. gracilis EO (50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL) or for 2h with its major compound, carvacrol (100 \u00b5g/mL), had a 100% reduction in viability. After interaction with L. alba EO (100\u00b5g/mL), there was a reduction of approximately 60% in the viability of adult worms after 24 hours of exposure; citral (50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL), its major compound, reduced the viability after 24 hours by more than 75%. Treatment of schistosomula with 100 \u00b5g/mL of L. gracilis or L. alba EOs for 6h led to a reduction in parasite viability of 80% and 16% respectively. Both EOs and their major compounds significantly reduced the oviposition of adult worms exposed to a non-lethal concentration (5 \u00b5g/mL). In addition, morphological changes such as the destruction of the tegument and disorganization of the reproductive system of male and female worms were visualized. Both EOs showed low cytotoxicity at a concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. The results encourage further investigation of these plants as a potential source of bioactive compounds against S. mansoni."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
