The magnitude of AA variations with protein level and the nature of the relationships that are involved were determined. Regression equations to predict AAs from protein were developed for the cultivar Bohatyr. The experiments were carried out at two locations in southern Manitoba in 1994. The levels of N fertilization investigated were: 56, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg/ha. At each level of N application, seeds planted were either Rhizobium inoculated or not inoculated. The combination of location, fertilizer treatments and inoculation yielded 192 samples for chemical analyses. The samples were analyzed for dry matter (DM), N and AA contents. Location and N fertilization had significant (p < or = 0.001) effects on seed protein content and AA composition. Seed protein content increased with increasing levels of N application. The response of protein to fertilization was not the same in both locations as evidenced from the presence of interaction (p < or = 0.01) between location and N application. Except for methionine and cystine, percent AAs in DM increased with increasing levels of N application. The effects of N application on the concentrations of methionine and cystine were not consistent. On protein basis, the concentrations of AAs decreased with increasing levels of N application. The only exception was arginine which strongly increased in concentration. There was no effect (p > or = 0.05) of seed inoculation observed in this study. Strong positive correlations (r > 0.80) between seed protein content and AA concentrations expressed as percent of DM were found for all AAs except for methionine (r = 0.76) and cystine (r = 0.51). When AA concentrations are expressed as g per 16 g N, 15 of the 17 AAs were negatively correlated to seed protein content. Only arginine (r = 0.78) and aspartic acid (r = 0.17) had positive correlations. The regression equations developed from this study could be used to predict the concentrations of AAs except methionine and cystine for the cultivar Bohatyr once the protein content is known."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada."}], "LastName": "Igbasan", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guenter", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Warkentin", "ForeName": "T D", "Initials": "TD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mcandrew", "ForeName": "D W", "Initials": "DW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manitoba"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Sci Food Agric. 1971 Oct;22(10):501-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5158796"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8811721", "10.1007/BF01091965"]}}]}
