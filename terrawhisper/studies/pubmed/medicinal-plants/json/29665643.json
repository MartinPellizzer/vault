Propolis is a honey bee product with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities that could potentially protect against adhesive surgical complications.", "Forty 8-weeks-old rats (275\u202f\u00b1\u202f25\u202fg) were divided into five groups: normal group without any surgical procedure, and experimental groups treated with normal saline, 50\u202fmg/kg, 100\u202fmg/kg and 200\u202fmg/kg of propolis. Peritoneal adhesions were examined macroscopically and also, the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1), growth factors (TGF-\u03b21 and VEGF) were evaluated in the study groups using ELISA. Biochemical indices of oxidative status including Nitric Oxide (NO), Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Glutathione (GSH) were also measured.", "Peritoneal adhesion scores, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21, VEGF, NO, GSH and MDA levels were significantly different between the study groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Propolis treatment reduced peritoneal adhesion (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), TNF-\u03b1 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), IL-1\u03b2 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), IL-6 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), TGF-\u03b21 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), VEGF (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), NO (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and MDA (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), while GSH levels were increased (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared with the vehicle group. Our results showed that higher dose of propolis was associated with significantly greater reductions in peritoneal adhesion (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), TNF-\u03b1 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), IL-1\u03b2 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), IL-6 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), VEGF (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), NO (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and MDA (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), a greater increase in GSH levels (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) compared with the lower dose.", "Propolis treatment can dose-dependently reduce peritoneal adhesion through its anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and antioxidant properties.
