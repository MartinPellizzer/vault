Both neutrophil- and eosinophil-mediated inflammation have been involved in the pathophysiology of acute bronchitis, but neutrophil cell recruitment has been shown to be dominant. The ongoing inflammation increases the chemotaxis of neutrophils to inflamed site providing to their overaccumulation. The pharmacological reduction of neutrophil migration can be limited by suppression of major chemo-attractants and cytokines (IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) release and downregulation of adhesive molecules.", "During a screening of plants traditionally used in respiratory tracts diseases (e.g. cough, rhinitis, bronchitis, throat infection, fever, influenza) in Europe, we have selected roots of Inula helenium and aerial parts of Grindelia squarrosa as a potential source of compounds limiting neutrophil migration.", "The effect on IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 release by neutrophils and respiratory epithelium cell line (A549) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The surface expression of adhesive molecules was analyzed with flow cytometry, and the neutrophil attachment to the epithelial cells was assessed fluorimetrically.", "We confirmed the ability of selected extracts and compounds to suppress neutrophil binding to the epithelium surface via downregulation of \u03b22 integrin. Alantolactone and grindelic acid have shown significant suppression of IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release comparable with budesonide, used as a positive control.", "The present study demonstrated that Inula helenium and Grindelia squarrosa, which have been traditionally used in Europe as medicinal plants, are a valuable source of active compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. Our observations justify the traditional use of I.\u00a0helenium and G.\u00a0squarrosa for a treatment of inflammation-based diseases in respiratory tract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
