The protein from the stem of Oroxylum indicum was isolated and purified using anion-exchange followed by gel filtration chromatography. The purity of protein was checked using SDS-PAGE, which showed a single band of 50\u202fkDa. The purified protein was identified as CRCK2 using MALDI-TOF. Using I-TASSER, a bioinformatics tools, the model of protein was constructed and its secondary structure was predicted using VADAR. The secondary structure content was also determined by far-UV CD, which indicated that the CRCK2 is mainly \u03b2-sheet dominating protein (43% \u03b2-sheet). The secondary structural content predication from computational method is in close agreement with the result obtained by CD spectropolarimeter. This study validates I-TASSER model for determination of structure of a protein. Moreover, stability of CRCK2 was monitored against heat- and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced denaturation by using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. Denaturation curve analysis gave values of 2.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12\u202fkcal\u202fmol<sup>-1</sup>and 4.11\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.09\u202fM for \u2206\u00b0G<sub>D</sub> (Gibbs free energy change at 25\u202f\u00b0C) and C<sub>m</sub> (midpoint of denaturation), respectively. It has been observed that purified CRCK2 is quite stable protein against both heat-induced as well as GdmCl-induced denaturation. This is very first report of purification and biophysical characterization of CRCK2 protein from medicinal plant O. indicum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
