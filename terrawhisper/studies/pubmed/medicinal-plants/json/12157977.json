This society looks after young girls, preparing them for their roles as wives and mothers. Training used to last 6 months, but present day duration is often reduced to 7 or 10 days. Women of this society build their social centers in the bush, bringing food and necessary items for the ceremonies (usually held 4-5 times per year). The society also organizes activities which are sources of income for women. About 85% of the population consults these traditional practitioners, who are competent in the use of herbal medicine and have a humane understanding of the patient's condition. Dr. Koso-Thomas believes modern doctors have to take traditional medicine seriously, as most of the medicinal plants used have curative effects, and the native people have faith in them. Circumcision is the only negative element in the Bundo Society, which he believes can be eliminated by a program of education and sensitization."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["20470cr986", "00160373"], "GeneralNote": ["Also published in French", "TJ: INTER-AFRICAN COMMITTEE ON TRADITIONAL PRACTICES AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN NEWSLETTER"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Culture", "Data Collection", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "English Speaking Africa", "Female Genital Mutilation", "Genitalia, Female", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Health--women", "Indigenous Health Services", "Interviews", "Maternal-child Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Organizations--women", "Primary Health Care", "Research Methodology", "Sierra Leone", "Western Africa"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12157977", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1986", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1986", "Month": "Jul"}}, "Title": "Newsletter (Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children)", "ISOAbbreviation": "Newsl Inter Afr Comm Tradit Pract Affect Health Women Child"}, "ArticleTitle": "The \"Bundo\" secret society in Sierra Leone.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "12", "EndPage": "14", "MedlinePgn": "12-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Samb", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Newsl Inter Afr Comm Tradit Pract Affect Health Women Child", "NlmUniqueID": "101086386"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa South of the Sahara"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genitalia, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal-Child Health Centers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organizations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sierra Leone"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12157977"]}}]}
