From the 426 endophytic fungi screened, <i>Trichoderma harzianum</i> SWUKD3.1610 was detected to have a component with the same TLC <i>R</i> <sub><i>f</i></sub> value and HPLC retention time as authentic nigranoic acid. This component was further confirmed as nigranoic acid by investigating the chemical composition of the fungal extracts. Besides (<b>1</b>), one new triterpenoid, 7<i>\u03b2</i>- schinalactone C (<b>2</b>), and two known minor compounds were isolated and characterized by HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic methods. Our study indicates that endophytic fungus may play an important role in increasing the quality of the crude drugs from Chinese medicinal plant <i>K. angustifolia</i>. This study is the first to isolate, characterize, and identify schitriterpenes-producing <i>Trichoderma spp</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory of Eco-Environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region (Ministry of Education), School of Life Science , Southwest University , Chongqing , P.R.
