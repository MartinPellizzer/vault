Among the focal points of study within this family are lectins, proteins with affinity for binding carbohydrates. This review endeavors to gather data gleaned from numerous studies conducted over the past three decades on lectins extracted from Araceae plants. Our examination spans their extraction and purification methods, their specific interactions with carbohydrates, their molecular structures, and various physicochemical characteristics. Furthermore, we investigated the biological activities of these lectins and investigated the outcomes of cloning their genes. Despite their apparent similarities, these lectins exhibit notable distinctions, particularly regarding their unique preferences in interacting with erythrocytes from animals and humans, their sugar affinities, the critical amino acids for their functionality, the molecular weights of their subunits and their respective topologies, and ultimately, their dimerization and 3D \u03b2-prism-II structure, which reportedly diverge from those observed in other GNA-related lectins. These discrepancies not only deepen our understanding of monocot lectins but also render these proteins inherently captivating. This review marks the inaugural attempt at consolidating almost all published reports on lectins from the Araceae family, with the aim of furnishing glycobiology scientists with essential insights into potential laboratory challenges, the characteristics of these lectins, and avenues for future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
