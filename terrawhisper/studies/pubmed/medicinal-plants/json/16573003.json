The expression of CD14 and scaverger receptor were detected with immunohigtochemistry at the 2nd, 4th, 8th hour ofter injury and analyzed with computer image system, and the pathological changes of liver tissue were also observed.", "At the three different hours, the expression of CD14 and scaverger receptor in macrophages of liver of LPS-injury group showed significant increase and significant decrease respectively, compared with that of the blank-control group (P < 0.01). The expression in dexamethasone group and Liangge San different dose groups were intermediate between those in injury group and those in control group. Compared with expression of LPS-injury group, those of dexamethasone group and Liangge San different dose groups showed significant differences (P < 0.01), especially that of Liangge San high dose group. Liver cells showed vacuole change. Changes of CD14 and SR expression were paralleled with the severity of liver damages of the mice.", "Liangge San can inhibite the up-regulation of CD14 expression and down-regulation of scaverger receptor expression in a dosage-dependent manner and also alleviate the damages of liver induced by LPS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanfang Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. yulzh@fim-mu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Lin-Zhong", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ai-Da", "Initials": "AD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yu-Yao", "Initials": "YY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Qing-He", "Initials": "QH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Scavenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S5I7G3JQL", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexamethasone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dexamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kupffer Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Scavenger"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16573003"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
