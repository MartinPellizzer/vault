Some problems in the A. roxburghii industry were revealed and a variety of sustainable development countermeasures were also proposed. The main problems of A. roxburghii industry are the lack of protection for wild resources, the lag in the speed of variety breeding, the insufficient research on the quality systems, the low level of industry and product innovation capability, as well as the relatively low market cognition and brand competence. Therefore, strengthening the protection for breeding resources, establishing a dynamic monitoring system, promoting the variety breeding, constructing a propagation system for improved varieties, enhancing the quality of medicinal herbs, accelerating the adjustment of product structure, upgrading the industry technology, strengthening brand competence and expanding the market, will be the effective methods to realize the sustainable development of A. roxburghii industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Farmers' Development Research of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nurturing Station for the State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Qing-Song", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ai-Cun", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ai-Lian", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jian-Wei", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang Agriculture & Forestry University, Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu-Qiu", "Initials": "YQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Orchidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28868881", "10.4268/cjcmm20160334"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
