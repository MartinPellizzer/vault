Comparison of the coat proteins by the techniques of amino acid analysis and PAGE was inadequate to distinguish strains from distinct potyviruses. However, high-performance liquid chromatographic peptide profiles of tryptic digests of coat proteins of these legume-infecting potyviruses enabled such assignments to be made. These data indicate that amino acid sequences of coat proteins of azuki bean mosaic virus, the Type and W strains of blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, three isolates (74, PM, PN) of a potyvirus obtained from soybean in Taiwan, and the Blotch and Mild Mottle strains of peanut stripe virus (PStV) may be very similar to the known sequence of PStV Stripe coat protein. In contrast, peptide profiles of coat proteins from soybean mosaic virus, clover yellow vein virus, bean yellow mosaic virus, potato virus Y, and tobacco etch virus were dissimilar to each other and to the profile of PStV Stripe, suggesting that their coat protein sequences were also quite different. Based on observations of the coat protein structure of many potyviruses, the results suggest that the potyvirus isolates with similar coat proteins are strains of the same potyvirus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering, Parkville, Australia."}], "LastName": "McKern", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shukla", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barnett", "ForeName": "O W", "Initials": "OW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vetten", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dijkstra", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Whittaker", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Intervirology", "NlmUniqueID": "0364265", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5526"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1500273", "10.1159/000150241"]}}]}
