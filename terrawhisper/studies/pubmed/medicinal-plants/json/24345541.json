Various studies have suggested that obesity per se is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, as well as predisposing to type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Furthermore, obesity induces insulin resistance, which is associated with development of cardiovascular diseases that include hypertension, and reduced endothelial function. A variety of pharmacological and physiological as well as surgical interventions have been used to counteract deleterious effects of obesity with some degree of success. A number of new medicinal agents are being considered as a candidate for managing obesity and its associated cardiovascular abnormalities. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phenolic trihydroxystilbene substance, which is present in a variety of plants have been shown to reverse detrimental effects of diet-induced obesity. This review examines role of resveratrol as a future anti-obesity agent.:"], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00c2\u00a9 2009 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity .
