They are emerging as opportunistic pathogens in medical microbiology and dermatology by causing recurring and recalcitrant infection. Combinatorial therapy is a constructive way to combat infectious diseases. In that prospect, totally 16 Indian medicinal plants were screened, among which a maximum degree of antimicrobial activity was ascertained in Embelia ribes. Subsequently embelin was identified as the bioactive principle with antagonistic potential by comparative antimicrobial assay and FTIR analysis. The MIC of embelin was determined as 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml exhibiting \u223c75% of growth inhibition. Further, a fungistatic activity based on anti-lipase potential (65-89%) of embelin has been clearly substantiated by XTT and lipase assay. In addition, embelin exhibited a synergistic effect with the antifungal drug ketoconazole (KTZ) against four different Malassezia spp. with FIC index of 0.5. Therefore, the combinations of embelin and KTZ may represent a promising therapeutic regimen to treat Malassezia infections with subjugated clinical and environmental toxicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report delineating the anti-lipase activity of embelin and in\u00a0vitro synergistic interaction between embelin and KTZ against Malassezia spp."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
