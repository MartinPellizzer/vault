In this study, we aim to assess compounds present in root extracts of <i>C. nutans</i>, and evaluate their antioxidant capacity and toxicity. To determine the chemical composition of the extract, was performed through Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectroscopy. Antioxidant capacity, toxicity (<i>Artemia salina</i> biosassay), cytotoxicity, genotoxicity (<i>Allium cepa</i> test), and neurotoxicity (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model) were evaluated. A large number of bioactive phytoconstituents were determined to be present, such as alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, terpenes, and especially phenolic compounds, which may explain the antioxidant capacity of the extract. Extracts had the capacity to protect cells from protein and lipid damage, and inhibit the formation of oxygen radicals. The <i>A. salina</i> bioassay revealed that extracts were only slightly toxic. In <i>A. cepa,</i> cells exposed to 1.5\u2009mg/mL extract were protected against chromosomal damage caused by glyphosate, and had mitotic index values that were reduced by 49%. A concentration of 10\u2009mg/mL extract did not kill flies, and when coadministered with paraquat (PQ) (52.5%) produced a mortality rate of only 18.75%. These findings indicated that the extract had the potential to protect against PQ-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, these data reveal for the first time that the root extract of <i>C. nutans</i> is a rich source of natural antioxidants. The extract may be useful in the food and pharmaceutical industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physico-Chemical Studies and Natural Products Laboratory (LEFQPN), Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Uruguaiana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Letiele Bruck de", "Initials": "LB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Laboratory, Universidade Regional Integrada do Alto Uruguai e das Miss\u00f5es, Santiago, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gindri", "ForeName": "Amanda Leit\u00e3o", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Laboratory, Universidade Regional Integrada do Alto Uruguai e das Miss\u00f5es, Santiago, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Fortes", "ForeName": "Thainara de Andrade", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physico-Chemical Studies and Natural Products Laboratory (LEFQPN), Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Uruguaiana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Enderle", "ForeName": "Jefferson", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physico-Chemical Studies and Natural Products Laboratory (LEFQPN), Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Uruguaiana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Roehrs", "ForeName": "Rafael", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oxidative Stress Studies Group (GESTOX), Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Uruguaiana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Manfredini", "ForeName": "Vanusa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physico-Chemical Studies and Natural Products Laboratory (LEFQPN), Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Uruguaiana, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Denardin", "ForeName": "Elton Lu\u00eds Gasparotto", "Initials": "ELG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drosophila melanogaster"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Onions"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32543960", "10.1089/jmf.2019.0309"]}}]}
