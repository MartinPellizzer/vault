The review has been compiled using reference materials from major databases, Online Journals, Science Direct, Scopus, Open J Gate, Google Scholar and PubMed. Psoriasis is a common skin disease affecting 2-3% of the world's population. It is cosmetically debilitating and chronic disease, which occurs both in developing and developed countries. It can affect any part of the body, but the most common sites are the elbows, knees, and scalp. It is usually treated with synthetic medicine either given systematically or applied locally. The prescribed synthetic medicines used for the treatment of psoriasis are associated with severe side effects and complications, thus researchers around the world are trying to explore new, more effective, and safer drugs from natural resources. Medicinal plants are safe and efficacious, and most of the people all over the world rely on herbal medicine due to their easy availability, low cost, and efficacy for treating psoriasis. A number of medicinal plants having therapeutic potential with high efficacy are used in the treatment of psoriasis have been described. Moreover, studies should be conducted to isolate and investigate the mechanism of actions of phytochemicals responsible for anti-psoriasis potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5663-5211"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Innovative Materia Medica Research Institute, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Daniyal", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3335-5436"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zainab", "ForeName": "Rida", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Directorate of Medical Sciences, College of Allied Health Professionals, GC University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Munir", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Syed Muhammad Ali", "Initials": "SMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Developmental Regulation, College of Biology, Hunan University, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "TCM and Ethnomedicine Innovation & Development International Laboratory, Innovative Materia Medica Research Institute, School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Allied Health Sciences, Sargodha Medical College, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Riaz", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jabeen", "ForeName": "Farhat", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dermatol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "9700070", "ISSNLinking": "1396-0296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30838736", "10.1111/dth.12866"]}}]}
