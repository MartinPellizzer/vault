But, if an extension of 10cm of the bark on each end of the necrotic part was removed in time and re-covered with new bark taken from another tree, the re-covered bark and the newly girdled part could heal together one week after. Opposite to the necrotic surface the loose part of the re-covered bark regenerated callus from the phloem ray cells. If the re-covered part was very close to the necrotic surface, no callus was regenerated. However, many scattered tracheid-like elements derived from phloem were found. And then groups of cells including several tracheid-like elements were discernible. There was a ring of meristematic cells around that group of cells. Finally these meristems gradually became normal and had usual activities of vascular cambium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Z G", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Z D", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sci Sin B", "NlmUniqueID": "8209875", "ISSNLinking": "0253-5823"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6867680"]}}]}
