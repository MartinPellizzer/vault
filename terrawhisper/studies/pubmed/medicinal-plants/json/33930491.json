(Aatrilal) a member of the family Apiaceae, is native to Egypt and widely distributed in Europe, the Mediterranean, and West Asia. It has been used for the treatment of various dermatological disorders particularly vitiligo in the Unani system of Medicine for ages. In traditional medicine, fruits are used as an emmenagogue as well as a diuretic, blood purifier and to treat leprosy, urinary and digestive disorders.", "This paper aims to highlight the medicinal properties of Aatrilal in view of its temperament and phytoconstituents; to signify its potential in the treatment of vitiligo and other ailments as mentioned in Unani system of medicine and also to explore its phytochemistry, pharmacological and clinical studies.", "Aatrilal was explored in classical Unani literature for its temperament (mizaj), medicinal properties and therapeutic uses. Published works available on PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were referred to collect all the available information regarding its phytochemicals and pharmacological studies. All relevant articles up to 2020 were referred including 15 classical Unani books, 15 English books, 72 research, and 3 review papers. The plant's scientific names were validated using 'The Plant List' (www.theplantlist.org). Standard Unani Medical Terminology published by Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine in collaboration with the World Health Organization was used to describe the appropriate Unani terminologies. Glossary of Indian Medicinal Plants and different indexed journals were consulted for botanical and English names.", "Aatrilal has been used in traditional medicine for ages. Due to controversies in its identity, it was adulterated and substituted with many drugs. The real identity of Aatrilal is now established as the fruit of A. majus L. Despite having numerous pharmacological activities, it is considered the first-line drug for the treatment of vitiligo. It is a rich source of furanocoumarins (xanthotoxin, also known as 8-methoxypsoralen, bergapten, imperatorin, isopimpinellin) with other compounds viz. flavonoids, terpenoids, proteins, essential oil constituents, etc. It has been reported for anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, antiviral, cytotoxic, and many other activities. Clinical trials have shown the therapeutic potential in vitiligo and other skin disorders.", "Based on the available literature, it can be concluded that Aatrilal is a drug that has been effectively used in Unani system of medicine for centuries to treat the cases of vitiligo and other dermatological disorders. It has been studied extensively for its phytopharmacological properties. Raw extracts of A. majus form the crux of the main research. Many potentially bioactive compounds are included in the essential oil, but to our knowledge, no detailed studies of its biological activity are yet available. Therefore, our suggestion is to focus future research on essential oil and its ingredients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
