Sapotaceae comprises a large number of fruit-producing plants of nutritional and medicinal value. Different species of family Sapotaceae received a considerable interest owing to their rich triterpenoid saponins content of a myriad pharmacological effects and health benefits. Several databases were searched for collecting papers for this review in the scope of phytochemistry, bioactivity and record of triterpenoid saponins from family Sapotacese such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus and Reaxys from 1990 till now. Triterpenoid saponins reported from Sapotaceae plants are mostly of protobassic acid, 16-\u03b1-hydroxyprotobassic acid, bayogenin, and oleanolic acid derivatives with both monodesmosidic and/or bidesmosidic attached sugar side chains. Besides, the most frequently attached sugar units are glucose, glucoronic acid, apiose, xylose, rhamnose, and arabinose. The reported health effects of Sapotaceae plants in folk medicine in relation to their bioactive saponins were also reviewed with special attention to anti-inflammatory, antiulcer activity, antimicrobial activity, cytotoxic, anti-hypercholesterolemic, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activities. This review aims to present a holistic compile on the phytochemical and biological diversity of triterpenoid saponins reported from family Sapotaceae with future perspectives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
