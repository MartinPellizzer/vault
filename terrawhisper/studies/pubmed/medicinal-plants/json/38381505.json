Exogenous auxins can improve the fruit-setting rate of plants; however, their impacts on M. tenacissima and regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a field experiment to determine the fruit-setting rate, seed-setting rate, fruit size, and changes in transcriptional expression of related genes by spraying 10 and 50\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA). The control plants were sprayed with distilled water. Our results indicated that the fruit-setting rate was 0.15 when treated with 10\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of IAA, which was 2.76-fold higher than that of the control. Compared with that of the control, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by 10\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of IAA was 28.6-fold higher than that regulated by 50\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of IAA. These DEGs were closely related to hormone metabolism and fruit development. By transcriptome analysis, spraying 10\u00a0mg\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup> of IAA increased the expressions of STP6, MYB17, and LAX3 and reduced those of CXE18, ILR1-like 3, and SAUR50; this possibly affected the ovule, embryo, and fruit development, thereby elevating the fruit-setting rate of M. tenacissima. Our results indicated that low IAA concentration increased the fruit-setting rate of M. tenacissima, providing theoretical and practical support for promoting the seed yield of M. tenacissima."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
