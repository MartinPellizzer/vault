The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), DPPH scavenging activity and the ameliorative effects of the extracts on Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced oxidative injury was investigated both in vitro and ex vivo. Alpha glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potentials of the extracts were examined in vitro, while the effects of the ethanol extract on abdominal glucose intake and muscle glucose uptake were determined in freshly harvested tissues ex vivo. The extracts were subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to identify their possible bioactive components. The ethanol extract showed the most potent FRAP and DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to other extracts. All extracts increased catalase and SOD activities, and GSH levels in oxidative pancreatic injury. Both ethanol and aqueous extracts exhibited remarkable enzyme inhibitory activities, which was significantly higher than ethyl acetate extract and acarbose but was not comparable to orlistat. The ethanol extract portrayed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on jejunal glucose uptake and enhancement of muscle glucose uptake. 9-(4 methoxyphenyl) xanthene, xanthone and stigmasterol showed strong binding affinities for \u03b1-glucosidase and lipase enzymes tested. Data from this study suggest that aerial parts of B. diffusa (particularly the ethanol extract) may not only exhibit antioxidant potentials but may also mediate anti-lipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects via inhibiting fat and carbohydrate digestion as well as abdominal glucose intake and enhancing muscle glucose uptake."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
