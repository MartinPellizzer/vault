The results indicated that there was a significant (Student's t-test, P < 0.004) increase in the number of beta cells in M. charantia-treated animals when compared with untreated diabetics, however, their number was still significantly less than that obtained for normal rats. There was also a significant (P < 0.006) increase in the number of delta cells in STZ-diabetic rats compared to non-diabetic rats. This increase in the number of delta cells was not affected by M. charantia treatment. The number of alpha cells did not change significantly in M. charantia-treated rats when compared with untreated diabetic rats. Our results suggest that oral feeding of M. charantia fruit juice may have a role in the renewal of beta cells in STZ-diabetic rats or alternately may permit the recovery of partially destroyed beta cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adeghate", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pallot", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Diabetes Res Clin Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "8508335", "ISSNLinking": "0168-8227"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Islets of Langerhans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Somatostatin-Secreting Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9716917", "10.1016/s0168-8227(98)00022-9", "S0168822798000229"]}}]}
