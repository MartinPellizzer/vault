The enzyme is activated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate at nanomolar concentrations. The enzyme exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the reaction mechanism, deduced from initial velocity studies in the absence of inhibitors as well as product and dead-end inhibition studies, is rapid equilibrium random in the presence and absence of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. In the direction of fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation, saturating fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (1 microM) increases V congruent to 9-fold and increases V/KMgPPi and V/KF6P about 30-fold. In the reverse direction (phosphate phosphorylation), the same concentration of activator has little if any effect on V or the Km for inorganic phosphate (Pi) and Mg2+ but does increase V/KFBP about 42-fold. No changes were observed in any of the other rate constants. The binding affinity of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to all enzyme forms is identical. The activator site of the mung bean PPi-PFK binds fructose 2,6-bisphosphate with a Kact of 30 nM with the 2,5-anhydro-D-glucitol 1,6-bisphosphate (the most effective analogue) 33-fold less tightly. Of the alkanediol bisphosphate series, 1,4-butanediol bisphosphate exhibited the tightest binding (Kact congruent to 3 microM). These and a series of other activating analogues are discussed in relation to the activator site."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bertagnolli", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Younathan", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Voll", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cook", "ForeName": "P F", "Initials": "PF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "AM01155", "Acronym": "AM", "Agency": "NIADDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "AM31676", "Acronym": "AM", "Agency": "NIADDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "GM31686", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexosediphosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79082-92-1", "NameOfSubstance": "fructose 2,6-diphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphofructokinase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fructosediphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hexosediphosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphofructokinase-1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Phosphates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3021199", "10.1021/bi00364a034"]}}]}
