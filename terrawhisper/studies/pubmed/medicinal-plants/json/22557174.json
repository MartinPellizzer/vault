The stem bark of the tree is the principal constituent of several ayurvedic preparations which are widely prescribed in leucorrhoea, haematuria, menorrhagia and other diseases of the female genitourinary system. Because of destructive extraction and the absence of an organized cultivation programme, the avilbility of the crude drug is diminishing and this has resulted in the sale of adulterants. The commonly used adulterant is the bark of Polyalthia longifolia which shows some similarity with that of asoka. Studies were conducted at Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research station, Odakkali (Kerala Agricultural University) during 2001-2002 to evolve methods for differentiating the original drug from the adulterant species by anatomical biochemical and chromatographic techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Research Station (Kerala Agricultural University), Odakkali Asamannoor Post 683 549, Ernakulam District, Kerala, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "Samuel", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "Gracy", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joy", "ForeName": "P P", "Initials": "PP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skari", "ForeName": "Baby P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "T S", "Initials": "TS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557174", "PMC3330942"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
