In this study, a rapid, selective, and sensitive UHPLC-Orbitrap Exploris 240 MS method was developed to analyze the chemical composition of Jin-Gu-Lian capsules. A total of 88 compounds were identified, including 23 flavonoids, 23 organic acids, 14 phenylpropanoids, 12 phenols, eight alkaloids, four terpenes, three quinones, and one ketone. Among these, 21 compounds were clearly detected based on a comparison with reference standards and selected as quality control markers. Thereafter, these compounds were simultaneously determined in the Jin-Gu-Lian capsules. The established method was successfully validated and applied for the simultaneous determination of 21 biologically active compounds in Jin-Gu-Lian capsules of 27 sample batches. Quantitative data of the analytes were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis to determine the quality of the Jin-Gu-Lian capsules. Four compounds (JGLC6 [salidroside], JGLC8 [chlorogenic acid], JGLC12 [liriodendrin], JGLC19 [quercetin]) were identified as chemical markers for quality control of Jin-Gu-Lian capsules. Altogether, the established method was validated as a novel and efficient tool, that can be used for rapid analysis of Jin-Gu-Lian capsules. Accordingly, this study serves as a reference for scientific research on traditional Chinese and ethnic medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList":
