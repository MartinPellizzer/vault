Sowing mixtures of complementary legumes may overcome limitations of individual species. Responses of yearling steers grazing a mixture of three tropical legumes with bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) were evaluated at three stocking rates under continuous grazing. Carpon desmodium (Desmodium heterocarpon [L.] DC.), which is persistent under grazing but often difficult to establish, was combined with the short-lived legumes aeschynomene (Aeschynomene americana L.) and phasey bean (Macroptilium lathyroides [L.] Urb.). Diet composition, as determined by microhistological analysis of fecal samples, and animal performance were evaluated in three grazing periods: summer 1987 and spring 1988 (2.0, 3.5, and 5.0 steers/ha) and summer 1988 (3.0, 5.3, and 7.5 steers/ha). Stocking rate did not affect percentage of the selectively grazed legumes, aeschynomene and phasey bean, in the diet. Average daily gain decreased linearly (P less than .05) with increased stocking rate, as is typical for grass pastures. Aeschynomene and phasey bean contributed to diets during the first summer, and carpon desmodium contribution was greater in the second summer. These results indicate that this pasture mixture can provide legume herbage from aeschynomene and phasey bean in the year of sowing and from carpon desmodium thereafter. Over the range of grazing pressures obtained, legume responses were generally consistent; thus, optimizing stocking rate for gain per hectare or for economic returns can be targeted without additional constraints to maintain the contribution of these legumes to grazing livestock."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Florida, Agricultural Research and Education Center, Ona 33865."}], "LastName": "Aiken", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pitman", "ForeName": "W D", "Initials": "WD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chambliss", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Portier", "ForeName": "K M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preferences"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Loss"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1894572", "10.2527/1991.6983348x"]}}]}
