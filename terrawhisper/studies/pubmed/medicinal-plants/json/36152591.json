The medicinal properties of this plant are attributed to the total flavonoids of Scutellaria baicalensis (TFSB), particularly the main component, baicalin. This study provides a systematic and comprehensive list of the identified TFSB components and their chemical structures. The quality control process, pharmacokinetics, clinical application, and safety of Scutellaria baicalensis are discussed, and its pharmacological effect on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is detailed. Finally, the future research trends and prospects of this medicinal plant are provided.", "The Chinese and English papers related to TFSB were collected from the PubMed and CNKI databases using the relevant keywords. To highlight the pharmacological mechanism, clinical application, and safety of TFSB, the collected articles were screened and classified based on their research content.", "TFSB contains at least 100 different kinds of flavonoids, of which baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, scutellarin, and scutellarein are the main active ingredients. The preparation process of TFSB is relatively well established, and the extraction rate can be significantly increased by enzymatic pretreatment and ultrasonication. The low oral availability of TFSB may be effectively enhanced using nanoformulations. The available pharmacokinetic data show that flavonoid glycosides and aglycones with the same parent nucleus may be converted to structures that are conducive to absorption in vivo. Moreover, TFSB can protect against CVDs by inhibiting apoptosis, regulating oxidative stress response, participating in inflammatory response, protecting against myocardial fibrosis, inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy, and regulating blood vessels. In terms of clinical application and animal safety, the available studies show that TFSB can be applied in a wide range of clinical treatments and is safe to use is animals.", "This article systematically reviews the therapeutic effect and underlying pharmacological mechanism of TFSB against CVDs. The available studies clearly suggest that TFSB has great potential for the treatment of CVDs and is worthy of in-depth research and development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
