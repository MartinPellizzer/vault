Healthy China has become a national strategy, and the Big Health industry has ushered in a golden period of development. In this context, the concept of medicine and food homology and edible medicinal substances which have guided Chinese people to pursue health since ancient times have ushered in significant and favorable development opportunities, and the industrial scale has gradually expanded. The development and utilization of edible medicinal plants have also become an important research direction. In the industrialization process of modern health care and edible medicinal products, a large number of drug residues are often abandoned due to ineffective utilization, resulting in a huge waste of resources and increasing the pressure on the ecological environment. Under the guidance of the homology theory of medicine and food, based on the recycling strategy of Chinese medicine resources, this paper analyzed the inherent common characteristics such as physical and chemical properties and biological activity of Chinese medicine residues of edible medicinal plants and put forward some suitable resource utilization strategies and suggestions in combination with the current situation of resource development and utilization of Chinese medicine residues of edible medicinal plants, in order to promote the high-value development and utilization of medicinal and edible resources, and extend the industrial chain of edible medicinal resources, thereby empowering Big Health industry and facilitating Healthy China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Quality Monitoring and Technology Service Center for Chinese Materia Medica Raw Materials Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Research Center for Protection and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Hui-Ting", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Di", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Quality Monitoring and Technology Service Center for Chinese Materia Medica Raw Materials Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qun", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Quality Monitoring and Technology Service Center for Chinese Materia Medica Raw Materials Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Research Center for Protection and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qing", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Quality Monitoring and Technology Service Center for Chinese Materia Medica Raw Materials Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Research Center for Protection and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jin-Bao", "Initials": "JB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China Jiangxi Research Center for Protection and Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Provincial Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Nanchang 330046, China."}], "LastName": "Liao", "ForeName": "Wei-Bo", "Initials": "WB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35850857", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220316.103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
