Braun & Asch (C. minima) has been used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine to treat multiple diseases, including sinusitis, rhinitis, headache, and allergy. To date, the anticancer properties of C. minima have drawn considerable attention owing to the anticancer potential of C. minima extracts, the identification of active components, and the elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms. However, the anticancer properties and significance of active components in C. minima have rarely been summarized.", "This review presents a comprehensive summary of the anticancer properties exhibited by active components of C. minima.", "An extensive search for published articles on the anticancer activities and active components of C. minima was performed using Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar.", "C. minima extracts exhibited both anticancer and chemosensitizing effects. Phytochemical studies have identified the active anticancer components of C. minima extracts. Sesquiterpene lactones, such as 6-O-angeloylplenolin (6-OAP, or brevilin A) and arnicolide D, have similar structures and anticancer mechanisms. As the most abundant sesquiterpene lactone in C. minima, 6-OAP exhibits anticancer activities mainly by targeting Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3). Clinical trials have assessed the potential of 6-OAP in patients with vertex balding and alopecia areata, given its effect on JAK-STATs signaling. Chlorogenic acid, a representative organic acid in C. minima, reportedly possesses anticancer potential and inhibits tumor growth by affecting tumor microenvironment and has been approved for phase II clinical trials in patients with glioma in China.", "In the present review, we highlight intriguing anticancer properties mediated by active compounds isolated from C. minima extracts, particularly sesquiterpene lactones, which might provide clues for developing novel anticancer drugs. Relevant clinical trials on chlorogenic acid and 6-OAP can promote anticancer clinical applications. Therefore, it is worth comprehensively elucidating underlying anticancer mechanisms and conducting clinical trials on C. minima and its active components."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
