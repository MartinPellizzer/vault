Some recent studies reported the potential immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties of inhibitors of serine-threonine kinase, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). However, no study was conducted about the neuroprotective potential of everolimus (EVR), a selective and potent mTOR inhibitor. Therefore, this study was planned to investigate whether EVR has protective effects against glutamate-induced toxicity in PC12 cells, which are used as model for neurons injury, and to elucidate the underlying mechanism.", "PC12 cells were concurrently treated with glutamate (8\u2009mM) and EVR (0-40\u2009nM) for 24\u2009h. Then, the cells viability, apoptosis rate, and apoptosis-related proteins (caspase-3, bax and bcl-2) were measured using MTT, annexin V/PI and immunoblotting assays.", "Analyzing the protective effect of different concentrations of EVR (0-40\u2009nM) against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity revealed a significant increase in cell viability in co-treatment regimen (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Also, EVR (40\u2009nM) significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis through depressing the elevation of bax/bcl-2 ratio and expression of cleaved caspase-3, concentration depend.", "The results demonstrated, for the first time, that EVR could protect against glutamate-mediated PC12 cell death <i>via</i> inhibiting apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanoudi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bagheri", "ForeName": "Amirbehzad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "0270707", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3KX376GY7L", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9HW64Q8G6G", "NameOfSubstance": "Everolimus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Everolimus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammals"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "47"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33998365", "10.1080/00207454.2021.1929210"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
