Over 5000 years ago, curcumin was first employed in the traditional Indian medical system. A growing amount of investigation reveals that curcumin has several pharmacological characteristics, including anticancer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial properties. Clinical tests revealed no harm, but some participants did have moderate nausea or diarrhea. A degenerative joint condition known as osteoarthritis affects elderly populations all over the world. It has a chronic inflammatory etiology, which contributes to chondrocyte loss that results in a thinner surface of cartilage at the affected joints. Curcumin has been scientifically demonstrated to exhibit medicinal benefits for osteoarthritis (OA), and further research is being conducted on the numerous ways through which it suppresses inflammation and slows the progression of ailments. Clinical and preclinical studies suggest the potential efficacy of curcumin in managing osteoarthritis, warranting further investigation. With emphasis on the mechanisms associated, this review seeks to completely outline the clinical effectiveness of curcumin using data from a variety of scientific studies that have been published so far."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0004-3371-7259"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Goel Institute of Pharmacy and Sciences, Faizabad Road, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teerthanker Mahaveer College of Pharmacy, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Bajpai", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Teerthanker Mahaveer College of Pharmacy, Teerthanker Mahaveer University, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Chandra", "ForeName": "Phool", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Rheumatol Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101261938", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3971"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38874047", "10.2174/0115733971308639240529124155", "CRR-EPUB-141044"]}}]}
