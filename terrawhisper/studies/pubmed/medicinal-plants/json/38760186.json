However, the traditional claim that A.azurea can hasten burn wound healing has not been supported by scientific studies. This experiment used a male Wistar rats model to investigate the activity of A. azurea aerial parts methanolic extract in burn wound healing. To determine their ability to help in healing burn wounds in rat models, the active components of the aerial parts of A. azurea were extracted with 80% methanol, then, 1% and 10% ointments were prepared from the extract, and applied topically. The LCMS chromatography of A. azurea plant extract showed different active ingredients, including phenolic compounds, flavonoids, fatty acids, and others. The plant extract's investigated as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and histological effects on the burn wound healing process. The results showed a significant (p-value < 0.025) rate of burn wound healing with 78.6% and 84.8% contraction, respectively using 1% and 10% (w/w) extract ointments after 12 days. These results were corroborated by histological observations such as collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and repair of the remaining skin tissues without any sign of cutaneous toxicity. The plant extract showed significant (p-value < 0.025) antioxidant effect at the highest tested dose of 500\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, scavenging 89.78% of the DPPH with an IC50 of 213.6\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. These results confirmed by histological changes observations of collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and reformation of remaining skin tissues without any signs of dermal toxicity. The plant extract exhibited significant (p-value < 0.025) level of antioxidant agents, by scavenging 89.78% of the DPPH at 500\u00a0\u00b5g/mL with IC50 of 213.6\u00a0\u00b5g/mL. Additionally, all pro-inflammatory cytokines examined, including IL-6 and IL-10, the results exhibited reduction in IL-6 level and increase IL-10 level. The aerial extract of the A. azurea plant revealed a wealth of several significant active ingredients, including phenolic compounds, flavonoids, fatty acids, and others, suggesting the potential for anti-inflammatory, burn wound-healing, and antioxidant medications. These findings can open an avenue to find new therapeutics for burn wounds healing, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd and International Society of Burns Injuries.
