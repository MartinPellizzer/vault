The aim of this work was to evaluate the production of plant biomass and the production of 4-NC in roots of cultivated P. peltatum over a full life cycle. Seedlings were produced in a greenhouse and then transplanted. The weight of dry plant parts (leaves, stems, roots, and inflorescences); numbers of stems, leaves, and inflorescences; and the leaf-to-stem ratio were evaluated at intervals of 60 days after transplanting (DAT). Extracts were prepared using 1:1 ethanol-chloroform and an ultrasound bath. Roots, leaves, and inflorescences contained 4-NC according to TLC photodensitometry analysis. Quantification of 4-NC in root extracts was performed using HPLC-DAD analysis. Per-hectare production of 4-NC by roots was estimated based on quantitative HPLC analysis and biomass data. Optimal per-hectare yields of 4-NC were obtained by harvesting roots between 350 and 400 DAT. In this period, the average yield was 27 kg 4-NC per hectare. Importantly, at the time of maximal overall production of root biomass (470 DAT), there was a decrease in the production of 4-NC (23.8\u2009kg/ha), probably due to the onset of senescence."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart-New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Federal University of Amazonas, Graduate Course in Biotechnology, Manaus, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinto", "ForeName": "Ana Cristina da Silva", "Initials": "AC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chaves", "ForeName": "Francisco C\u00e9lio Maia", "Initials": "FC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "dos Santos", "ForeName": "Pierre Alexandre", "Initials": "PA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nunez", "ForeName": "Cec\u00edlia Ver\u00f4nica", "Initials": "CV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tadei", "ForeName": "Wanderli Pedro", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pohlit", "ForeName": "Adrian Martin", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nerolidylcatechol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Piper"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20195961", "10.1055/s-0029-1240938"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
