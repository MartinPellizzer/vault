Its pollen can also be collected by bees to produce toxic honey, posing a great threat to the health and safety of consumers. However, for the complex matrices such as cooked food and honey, it is challenging to perform composition analysis. It is necessary to establish more effective strategies for investigating GE contamination. In this study, the real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis combined with DNA barcode matK was proposed for the identification and detection of GE. Fifteen honey samples along with twenty-eight individuals of GE and the common confusable objects Lonicera japonica, Ficus hirta, Stellera chamaejasme and Chelidonium majus were gathered. Additionally, the food mixtures treated with 20-min boiling and 30-min digestion were prepared. Specific primers were designed, and the detection capability and sensitivity of qPCR in honey and boiled and digested food matrices were tested. The results demonstrated that the matK sequence with sufficient mutation sites was an effective molecular marker for species differentiation. GE and the confusable species could be clearly classified by the fluorescence signal of qPCR assay with a high sensitivity of 0.001\u00a0ng/\u03bcl. In addition, this method was successfully employed for the detection of deeply processed food materials and honey containing GE plants which even accounted for only 0.1\u00a0%. The sequencing-free qPCR approach undoubtedly can serve as a robust support for the quality supervision of honey industry and the prevention and diagnosis of food poisoning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
