A. Meyer) (PX) in the ratio 8:1:1. In this study, an elevated plus-maze test in mice was carried out to assess whether SK had an anxiolytic effect. No significant change was observed in either the plus-maze or activity test following a single administration of SK (10 and 20 mL/kg p.o.). However, mice allowed a free intake of SK (10% solution) for 5 days and longer showed a significant prolongation of the time spent in the open arms (an anxiolytic effect), as long as that caused by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1 mg/kg p.o.). SK (1%, 3% and 30% solutions for 7 days) tended to develop the anxiolytic effect. Of the constituents of SK, SS (8% solution), but not PN (1% solution) or PX (1% solution), resulted in the anxiolytic effect. Except for a slight acceleration in the motor activity by PN (1% solution), no significant change in the motor activity was produced by any treatment with SK, SS or PX. The combined treatment of SK (10% solution) or SS (8% solution) with 1 mg/kg diazepam enhanced the anxiolytic effect. Flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, alone did not change the time spent in the open arms. However, it completely reversed the anxiolytic effect of SK, SS and diazepam. The present results suggest that: (1) long-term treatment with SK develops an anxiolytic effect, (2) SS is the main constituent for the anxiolytic effect of SK, and (3) benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the anxiolytic effect of SK and SS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Development, Wakanyaku Medical Institute Ltd, 1193 Akagiyama, Fujimi-mura, Seta-gun, Gunma 371-0101, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuribara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iwata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomioka", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Murohashi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koya", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sho-ju-sen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11268115", "10.1002/ptr.698", "10.1002/ptr.698"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
