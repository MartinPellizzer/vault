The similarities and dissimilarities of pigment composition of chili powders were elucidated by principal component analysis (PCA). RP-HPLC separated 50-100 pigment fractions depending on the detection wavelength and on the origin of chili powder. It was found that the pigment composition of chili powders from Malaysia and China and from India and Pakistan show marked similarities while the composition of colour pigments of chili powder from Thailand was different. It was further established that the chromatograms are similar in the first 5-35 min of development, they are highly different between 35 and 75 min and moderately different at the end of the chromatograms. It was concluded that RP-HPLC followed by PCA can be successfully used for the identification of chili powders according to the composition of their colour pigments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Research Centre, Institute of Chemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00f3sa", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cserh\u00e1ti", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forg\u00e1cs", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morais", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mota", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramos", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11358243", "10.1016/s0021-9673(01)00640-9", "S0021-9673(01)00640-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
