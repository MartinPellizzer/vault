Enriching ion channel data is a critical first step in comprehending a formula's mechanism of action.", "This study aims to explore the effective disease spectrum of the Qi Yu granule formula through network pharmacology analysis and backtracking, and analyze its potential curative effects on liver and spleen system diseases, particularly depression and breast cancer.", "Using pharmacological tools and database analysis, the ion channel data of the formula's components were investigated. The effective disease spectrum was determined, and diseases related to liver and gallbladder, liver depression, and spleen deficiency were identified. Network pharmacology analysis was conducted to backtrack diseases, target gene proteins, and drug compositions. The extraction technology of volatile oil from medicinal herbs was experimentally studied to optimize the preparation process.", "The effective disease spectrum analysis identified potential curative effects of the Qi Yu granule formula on various diseases, including breast cancer. Backtracking revealed relationships between diseases, target gene proteins, and drug compositions. Experimental studies on volatile oil extraction provided insights into optimizing the preparation process.", "The study underscores the potential therapeutic benefits of the Qi Yu granule formula for liver and spleen system diseases. By integrating network pharmacology analysis and experimental research, this study offers valuable insights into the formulation and efficacy of the Qi Yu granules, paving the way for further exploration and optimization of TCM formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Experiment Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Experiment Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Fengxing", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Experiment Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Experiment Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Xiuping", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xinxin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Experiment Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qiming", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Technol Health Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9314590", "ISSNLinking": "0928-7329"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38759035", "10.3233/THC-232034", "THC232034"]}}]}
