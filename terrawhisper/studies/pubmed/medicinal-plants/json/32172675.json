In this study, an efficient protocol for the rapid propagation of <i>D. cariniferum</i> was developed. By using the tissue culture protocol, the effects of pH, hormone combinations, temperatures, light intensity, culture time protocorm proliferation, seedlings rooting, and accumulation of biomass with bioactive compounds were investigated. The experiments showed that the medium [1/2\u00a0MS + activated carbon1.0\u00a0g/L+\u00a0agar strip 7.5\u00a0g/L +\u00a0sucrose 25\u00a0g/L] effectively promoted the germination of <i>D. cariniferum</i> seeds. The optimal culture conditions were found at pH 5.7, temperature 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C, and light intensity of 1000\u00a0Lx in the protocorm proliferation stage. Adding 1.5\u00a0g/L peptone in the medium effectively promoted the seedling rooting. The optimal culture conditions for accumulation of bioactive compounds (polysaccharides and alkaloids) of seedlings were found at temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00b0C, light intensity of 1500-2000\u00a0Lx after the 60-day (d). Our study constructed a rapid propagation system in vitro for <i>D. cariniferum</i>, as well as the methods for efficient accumulation of active substances in seedling culture, which will serve as guidance for industrial production of <i>D. cariniferum</i> seedlings for both medicinal raw materials and ornamental plants. In addition, our study provided a new idea that we can directly use the high bioactive compound seedlings to extract medicinal components in industry conditions without transferring to the field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioresource Institute for Healthy Utilization, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiuming", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yuhan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Dongliang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Bizhu", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0850-8592"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioresource Institute for Healthy Utilization, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China."}], "LastName": "Sarsaiya", "ForeName": "Surendra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5456-6590"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FAFU and UIUC-SIB Joint Center for Genomics and Biotechnology, the Key Laboratory of National Forestry and Grassland Administration for Orchid Conservation and Utilization (Fuzhou), College of Horticulture, College of Food Science, College of Forestry, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaokai", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9359-0163"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioresource Institute for Healthy Utilization, Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jishuang", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bioengineered", "NlmUniqueID": "101581063", "ISSNLinking": "2165-5979"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Constance L, Renhwa S, Menglan S.. 1992.
