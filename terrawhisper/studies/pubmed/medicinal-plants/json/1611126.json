The rhythm in leaflet movement had a period close to 27 hr, whereas the rhythm in stomatal opening, measured as conductance to water vapor, had a period close to 24 hr. Photosynthesis, measured as net assimilation of CO2, also oscillated with a period close to 24 hr. The periods of these rhythms did not vary with increasing temperature, demonstrating temperature compensation of the controlling oscillators. The difference in free-running periods displayed by these rhythms is evidence that multiple oscillators with different intrinsic frequencies operate in bean plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Carnegie Institution, Washington Department of Plant Biology, Stanford, California 94305."}], "LastName": "Hennessey", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Field", "ForeName": "C B", "Initials": "CB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Rhythms", "NlmUniqueID": "8700115", "ISSNLinking": "0748-7304"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Clocks"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1611126", "10.1177/074873049200700202"]}}]}
