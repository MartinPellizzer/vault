However, it remains challenging because of potential inconsistency of relative response factors (RRF) on different instruments. In this work, the effects of two key roles, i.e., ultraviolet (UV) wavelength and standard solution concentrations, on reproducibility of RRF were investigated. The effect of UV wavelength on reproducibility of RRF was studied by plotting the relationship of the peak area ratios (internal standard vs analyte) to wavelengths. The preferable wavelength should be set at the flat parts of the curve. Optimized 300 nm produced a 0.38% RSD for emodin/emodin-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside on five instruments, much lower than 2.80% obtained from the maximum wavelength at 290 nm. Next, the effects of standard solution concentrations of emodin on its response factor (RF) were investigated. For one single point method, low concentration less than 49 b/k resulted in significant variations in RF. For emodin, when the concentration is higher than 7.00 \u03bcg mL(-1), a low standard deviation (SD) value at 0.13 was obtained, while lower than 7.00 \u03bcg mL(-1), a high SD at 3.71 was obtained. The developed SSDMC method was then applied to determination of target components in 10 Polygonum cuspidatum samples and showed comparable accuracy to conventional calibration methods with deviation less than 1%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
