Phytochemicals from dietary plants and other plant sources such as herbs are becoming increasingly important sources of anticancer drugs or compounds for cancer chemoprevention or adjuvant chemotherapy. Phytochemicals can prevent cancer initiation, promotion, and progression by exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects which are mediated by integrated Nrf2, NF-kappaB, and AP-1 signaling pathways. In addition, phytochemicals from herbal medicinal plants and/or some dietary plants developed in recent years have been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. In advanced tumors, a series of changes involving critical signaling molecules that would drive tumor cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and becoming invasive. In this review, we will discuss the potential molecular targets and signaling pathways that mediate tumor onset and metastasis. In addition, we will shed light on some of the phytochemicals that are capable of targeting these signaling pathways which would make them potentially applicable to cancer chemoprevention, treatment and control of cancer progression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Cancer Prevention Research, Department of Pharmaceutics, Ernest-Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 160 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shu", "ForeName": "Limin", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheung", "ForeName": "Ka-Lung", "Initials": "KL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khor", "ForeName": "Tin Oo", "Initials": "TO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chi", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Ah-Ng", "Initials": "AN"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 ES005022", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01-CA073674", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01-CA094828", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01-CA118947", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Metastasis Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "8605731", "ISSNLinking": "0167-7659"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20798979", "10.1007/s10555-010-9239-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
