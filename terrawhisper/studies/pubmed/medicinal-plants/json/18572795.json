Among others, the negative impacts include the extinction of some medicinal plants. The research issue is what strategy can be used for preserving the medicinal plants while little attention is given to them. A research action was thus started for preserving and conserving these plants. Methods used were participatory observation, field surveys, and demonstration-plots. The action consisted of: an awareness program, a preparation phase and the establishment of a park of medicinal plants. In doing that, the Systemic, Holistic, Interdisciplinary and Participatory (SHIP) approach was applied. Up to now, the results found are: 1) the awareness program was conducted several times; 2) two pieces of lands were provided from the provincial government of Bali and from the local community; 3) the field surveys identified about 200 kinds of medicinal plants in the house yards, government offices, hotels and median strips of roads; 4) in the traditional medicine texts (lontar), more then 500 kinds of medicinal plants were found to be cited; 5) the medicinal plants were classified into wooden trees, shrubs, grasses, watery plants, epiphytes and parasitic plants. It is concluded that preserving and conserving the medicinal plants in Bali is urgent and that there is a willingness to do that with the active support of the stakeholders. It is encouraging that good examples have already been established in Ubud, Tampaksiring and Karangasem. Therefore, it is recommended to establish a medicinal plants park in Bali since it will have multiplier effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of physiology, School of Medicine, University of Udayana, Denpasar, Bali 80232, Indonesia. nadip2003@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adiputra", "ForeName": "I Nyoman", "Initials": "IN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Hum Ergol (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0364267", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8134"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooperative Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18572795"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
