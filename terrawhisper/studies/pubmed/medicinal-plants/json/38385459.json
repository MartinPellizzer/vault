As best of our knowledge, current study first time reports the most potent inhibitors of LasR, a transcriptional activator of biofilm and virulence regulating genes in, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> LasR, utilizing newly functionalized imidazoles (5a-d), synthesized <i>via</i> 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using click approach. The synthesized ligands were characterized through Mass Spectrometry and 1H NMR. The binding potency and mode of biding of ligands. Quantum Mechanical(QM) methods were utilized to investigate the electronic basis, HOMO/LUMO and dipole moment of the geometry of the ligands for their binding potency. Dynamics cross correlation matrix (DCCMs) and protein surface analysis were further utilized to explore the structural dynamics of the protein. Free energy of binding of ligands and protein were further estimated using Molecular Mechanical Energies with the Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method. Molecular Docking studies revealed significant negative binding energies (5a\u2009-\u200910.33, 5b -10.09, 5c\u2009-\u200910.11, and 5d -8.33\u2009KJ/mol). HOMO/LUMO and potential energy surface map estimation showed the ligands(5a) with lower energy gaps and larger dipole moments had relatively larger binding potency. The significant change in the structural dynamics of LasR protein due to complex formation with newlyfunctionalized imidazoles ligands. Hydrogen bond surface analysis followed by MMPBSA calculations of free energy of binding further complemented the Molecular docking revelations showing the specifically ligand (5a) having the relatively higher energy of binding(-65.22kj/mol).Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
