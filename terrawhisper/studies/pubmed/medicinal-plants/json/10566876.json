MEMBH exhibited a remarkable antioxidant effect in a liposome model system, indicating that the extract was an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. The inhibitory effect of MEMBH on deoxyribose damage was amount-dependent and it afforded considerable protection against damage to deoxyribose. In addition, MEMBH at low amounts was more effective in protecting protein oxidation. Furthermore, the oxidation of 2'-dG to 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-2'dG) was inhibited by MEMBH. These results show that the extract also was an inhibitor of non-lipid oxidation damage. The extract exhibited metal binding ability and scavenging activity for hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical, which may explain the mechanism of their protecting lipids and non-lipids from oxidative damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Health, Chia Nan College of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan Hsien, Taiwan, ROC."}], "LastName": "Duh", "ForeName": "P D", "Initials": "PD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yen", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G9481N71RO", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10566876", "10.1016/s0278-6915(99)00096-4", "S0278-6915(99)00096-4"]}}]}
