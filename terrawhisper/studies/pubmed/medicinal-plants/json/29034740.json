The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the traditional herbal medicine Gamiguibi-tang (GGBT) in patients with cancer-related sleep disturbance.", "We conducted a prospective, randomized, wait-list-controlled, open-label pilot clinical trial on cancer-related sleep disturbance. Patients with cancer experiencing poor sleep quality with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index of at least 6 were randomly assigned to the GGBT and wait-list groups to receive GGBT and conventional care, respectively, for 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score. Fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment were assessed as the secondary endpoints by using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).", "Thirty participants who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled. Sleep disturbance assessed using the ISI improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (-5.5 \u00b1 4.4 vs 0.1 \u00b1 1.1, P < .001). Fatigue level determined using the BFI also improved significantly more in the GGBT group than in the wait-list group (-0.8 \u00b1 0.8 vs 0.0 \u00b1 0.3, P = .002). The BDI and MoCA scores showed no significant changes. Adverse events were reported in two patients in the GGBT group and consisted of mild dyspepsia and mild edema.", "GGBT may be a potential treatment option for cancer-related sleep disturbance. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GGBT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Korean Medicine Cancer Center, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jee Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Korean Medicine Cancer Center, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Hye Kyung", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Korean Medicine Cancer Center, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Han Sung", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Korean Medicine Cancer Center, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Sung Soo", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Eo", "ForeName": "Wankyu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Korean Medicine Cancer Center, Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Seong Woo", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Pragmatic Clinical Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Integr Cancer Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101128834", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7354"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fatigue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Severity of Illness Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Wake Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Garland SN, Johnson JA, Savard J, et al.
