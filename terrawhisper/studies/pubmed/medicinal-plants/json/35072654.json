The crude methanolic extract of whole herb of Phyla nodiflora (Pn.Cr) was subjected to phytochemical, antioxidant and neuropharmacological assessment. The Pn.Cr was initially exposed to the in vitro examination for phytocomposition through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). The Sprague Dawley rats were chronically administered with various doses (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) of Pn.Cr for one month with subsequent exposure to neurobehavioral and biochemical experimentation. The Pn.Cr exhibited a dose-dependent anxiolytic effect (P < 0.05 in comparison to control) as rats preferred central, illuminated and open arm zones in open field (OFT), light/dark (L/D) and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. Likewise, scopolamine-induced amnesia was noticeably reversed with P < 0.05 by Pn.Cr as animals showed improved spontaneous alternation, discrimination index and shorter escape latencies in Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Subsequently, in vivo enzymatic assays depicted the reduced acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde levels. The levels of oxidative stress combating enzymes (glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) were increased in a dose-dependent style. The UHPLC detected 22 phytocompounds were further investigated in silico studied to predict the interaction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing phytocompounds with human acetylcholinesterase. The four BBB crossing phytocompounds belonging to flavonoids, chalcones and alkaloids showed possible interaction with the target enzyme. We found that the phytocompounds owned by Pn.Cr might be playing multiple roles in modulation of different pathways to hinder the pathophysiology of neurological disorders including anxiety and Alzheimer's disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "H M A", "Initials": "HMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Women University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Javaid", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmacy, Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rasool", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Anjum", "ForeName": "S M M", "Initials": "SMM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, P.R.
