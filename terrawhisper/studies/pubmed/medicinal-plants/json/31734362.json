It is difficult to remove the hull of Tartary buckwheat fruit and breeding new easy-dehulled varieties has been one of the major breeding objectives. The bHLH gene family plays a vital role in plant growth and fruit dehiscence. In order to improve Tartary buckwheat breeding, we need to study the bHLH gene family for excavating genes with potential regulation of fruit development and dehiscence. Here, 164 Fagopyrum tataricum bHLH (FtbHLH) genes were identified. Analyses of gene structure and motif composition illustrate that the members of specific FtbHLH subfamily are relatively conserved. Synteny and phylogenetic analyses of bHLH genes in Tartary buckwheat and other plants lay a foundation for further exploring the evolutionary characteristic of the FtbHLH genes (FtbHLHs). qRT-PCR experiments showed that FtbHLHs expression patterns were different in plant organs, indicating that they may perform diverse functions. In addition, some genes that potentially regulate flower and fruit development and easy dehulling were screened out. Overall, this study will be helpful for further analyzing the biological function of FtbHLHs and provides clues for improving the genetic breeding and economic value of the Tartary buckwheat."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
