It is currently used in studies involving cancer and platelet aggregation in humans, as well as herbicide resistance in plants. Inhibitors of apyrase are being investigated for their use to suppress tumors and combat herbicide resistance. Only a few inhibitors of apyrase have been reported, many of which were identified through automated screening using a 96-well plate format and colorimetric phosphate detection. However, these screens have had limitations, including large volumes, inconsistent reproducibility, high incidence of false hits, and lack of higher-throughput compatibility. A luciferin/luciferase-based detection system has been reported to examine potential inhibitors of apyrase; however, these reactions were performed in tubes with the assay completion in seconds, which necessitate the development of a high-throughput screening (HTS)-compatible format for screening. Therefore, a more cost-effective biochemical assay that improved the limitations of the previous assay formats using a commercially available luminescence-based detection system was developed. This new robust mix-and-read platform incorporates a low-volume luminescence-based protocol, formatted for use in 384-well microplates. This new format provides a simple and cost-effective method to screen for apyrase inhibitors and will facilitate larger HTS efforts to identify potent inhibitors of apyrase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Targeted Therapeutic Drug Discovery and Development Program, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Veloria", "ForeName": "John R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Targeted Therapeutic Drug Discovery and Development Program, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Devkota", "ForeName": "Ashwini K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Targeted Therapeutic Drug Discovery and Development Program, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Eun Jeong", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Targeted Therapeutic Drug Discovery and Development Program, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Division of Chemical Biology & Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA."}], "LastName": "Dalby", "ForeName": "Kevin N", "Initials": "KN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "SLAS Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101697563", "ISSNLinking": "2472-5552"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Apyrase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Apyrase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Screening Assays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27821623", "10.1177/1087057116675859", "S2472-5552(22)06939-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
