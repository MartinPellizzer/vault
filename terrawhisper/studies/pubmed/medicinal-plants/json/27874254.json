It is an important medicinal plant that has been used as a sedative and to improve memory for a number of years in most of Asia. However, the in vivo constituents of the multiple constituents from Radix Polygalae remain unknown. In the current study, ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and the MarkerLynx<sup>TM</sup> software combined with multiple data processing approach were used to study the constituents in vitro and in vivo. A rapid and efficient method for the characterization of multiple constituents in the herbal medicine Radix Polygalae by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry is described. In total, 35 compounds in the Radix Polygalae and 13 compounds absorbed into blood were characterized. Of the 35 compounds in vitro, ten were reported for first time. In the 13 compounds in vivo, six were prototype components and seven were metabolites were also elucidated for first time. This work narrowed the range of screening the potentially bioactive components and provided a basis for the quality control and mechanism of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
