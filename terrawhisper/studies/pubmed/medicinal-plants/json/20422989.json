The bolting date of winter raised seedlings started in middle of July, 50 d later than tranditional seedlings, and bolting peck date was in the last ten days of July, 40 d later than the traditional seedlings. The highest ratio of premature bolting for winter raised seedlings was 1%, and the lowest was 0.
