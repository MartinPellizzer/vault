However, the drug-like properties of these compounds are poor. To improve the physicochemical properties of rocaglaol, 36 nitrogen-containing phenyl-substituted rocaglaol derivatives were designed and synthesized. These derivatives were tested for the inhibitory effects on three tumor cell lines, HEL, MDA-231, and SW480, using the MTT assay. Among them, 22 derivatives exhibited good cytotoxic activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 0.11 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.88 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM. Fourteen derivatives exhibited stronger cytotoxicity than the positive control, adriamycin. In particular, a water-soluble derivative revealed selective cytotoxic effects on HEL cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.19 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcM). This compound could induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HEL cells. Western blot assays suggested that the water-soluble derivative could downregulate the expression of the marker proteins of apoptosis, PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9, thus inducing apoptosis. Further CETSA and Western blot studies implied that this water-soluble derivative might be an inhibitor of friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli-1). This water-soluble derivative may serve as a potential antileukemia agent by suppressing the expression of Fli-1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
