Traditional system of medicine throughout the world has been utilizing this group of plants to treat various ailments. One of the outstanding features of these spore forming plants is their chemistry, especially that of the liverworts. Liverworts have yielded a rich array of terpenoids, especially sesqui- and diterpenoids. Many of these compounds are characterized by unprecedented structures, and some have not been found in any other plants, fungi or marine organisms. Among the bryophytes, the chemical constituents of liverworts and their biological activity have been studied in the most detail. In this review the chemistry of the terpenoids found in bryophytes have been presented, and their phytotoxic, antimicrobial, antifungal, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, piscicidal, insect repellent, antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
