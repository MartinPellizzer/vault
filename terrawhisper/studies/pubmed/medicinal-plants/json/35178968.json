The present study statistically analyzed the harvest period standards of plant medicinal materials in the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia(Vol.\u2160) and put forward the existing problems and suggestions based on herbal records and modern research to provide references for the improvement of the standards. According to the statistical analysis, in 499 types of plant medicinal materials, harvest period standards are recorded under 486 types, accounting for 97.4%, and are lacking in the remaining. Only one medicinal material(Stellariae Radix) is recorded with the standard of the harvest year. The standards of the harvest season and phenological period are recorded under 233 types, accounting for 46.7%. For 237 types, only harvest season is specified, accounting for 47.5%, and for 15 types, only harvest phenological period is specified, accounting for 3.0%. Among 222 types mainly derived from cultivation and 51 types from wild resources and cultivation, only 11 types are recorded with harvest period of cultivated products. Only Stellariae Radix is recorded with the harvest period standards for the wild and cultivated products separately. The harvest period standards of plant medicinal materials with different medicinal parts have certain rules to follow. The main problems about the harvest period standards are discovered. Specifically, no harvest period standards are recorded under 13 types of plant medicinal materials. Almost all perennial cultivated medicinal materials are not recorded with harvest year standard. No phenological period standard is found under 250 types of plant medicinal materials. There is no clear distinction between the harvest period standards of cultivated and wild products. The evidence for harvest period standards of 26 types of plant medicinal materials that can be harvested all year round is insufficient. As a result, it is proposed to strengthen basic research in response to the above-mentioned problems and improve the harvest period standards as soon as possible to ensure the quality of Chinese medicinal materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Jie-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute & Department of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Medical Plant Cultivation Research Institute Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Jiang-Qun", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Medical Plant Cultivation Research Institute Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiu-Ling", "Initials": "QL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Breeding of Endangered Medicinal Materials, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China Key Laboratory of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for Agarwood Sustainable Utilization,Hainan Provincial Key Laboratory of Resources Conservation and Development of Southern Medicine,Hainan Branch of the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Haikou 570311,China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Jian-He", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35178968", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20211106.103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
