The participants were selected using simple random sampling. Participants received 5\u00a0ml syrup V. odorata or placebo twice a day for 1\u00a0month.

Exclusions consisted of 12 participants who\u00a0withdrew from the study due to unwillingness to cooperate,\u00a08 who had irregular\u00a0consumption of the therapeutic syrup, 6 with\u00a0inaccurate completion of the questionnaire, and 8 due to lack of accessibility. The two study groups were homogenous in terms of demographic characteristics.
