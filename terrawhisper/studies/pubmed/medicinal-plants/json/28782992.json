Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is effective and safe for this disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of TCM remedies for psoriasis are still not fully understood. TCM contains numerous natural products. Natural products have historically been invaluable as a resource of therapeutic agents. Yet, there is no integrated information about active compounds of TCM for psoriasis.", "We use systems pharmacology methods to develop the Psoriasis Database of Traditional Chinese Medicine (PDTCM). The database covered a number of psoriasis-related information (formulas, TCM, compounds, target proteins, diseases and biomarkers). With these data information, an online platform was constructed Results: PDTCM comprises 38 empirical therapeutic formulas, 34373 compounds from 1424 medicinal plants, 44 psoriasis-related proteins and 76 biomarkers from 111 related diseases. On this platform, users can screen active compounds for a psoriasis-related target and explore molecular mechanisms of TCM. Accordingly, users can also download the retrieved structures and data information with a defined value set. In addition, it helps to get a better understanding of Chinese prescriptions in disease treatment.", "With the systems pharmacology-based data, PDTCM would become a valuable resource for TCM in psoriasis-related research. Key messages PDTCM platform comprises a great deal of data on TCM and psoriasis. On this platform, users can retrieve and get needed information with systems pharmacology methods, such as active compounds screening, target prediction and molecular mechanisms exploration. It is a tool for psoriasis-related research on natural drugs systematically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The Second Institute of Clinical Medicine , Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Lab of Chinese Materia Medica Preparation , Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Postdoctoral Research Station , Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dongmei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The Second Institute of Clinical Medicine , Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Lab of Chinese Materia Medica Preparation , Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences , Guangzhou , China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Jiangyong", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The Second Institute of Clinical Medicine , Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Lab of Chinese Materia Medica Preparation , Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences , Guangzhou , China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering , Peking University , Beijing , China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering , Peking University , Beijing , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lirong", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Lab of Chinese Materia Medica Preparation , Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS), State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications, College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering , Peking University , Beijing , China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Xiaojie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a The Second Institute of Clinical Medicine , Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Lab of Chinese Materia Medica Preparation , Guangdong Provincial Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences , Guangzhou , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Clinical Research on Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome , Guangzhou , China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Chuanjian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Ann Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8906388", "ISSNLinking": "0785-3890"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Dissemination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28782992", "10.1080/07853890.2017.1364417"]}}]}
