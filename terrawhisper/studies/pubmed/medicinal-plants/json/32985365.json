One of the plant medicines from TAM used in this protocol is purgahuasca. It is a decoction of the vine <i>Banisteriopsis caapi</i> alone, whose use is traditional among the Awaj\u00fan and other ethnic groups in Peru. The research began with a field trip to Awaj\u00fan territory to explore the indigenous use of purgahuasca as an initiation rite. Then, analysis of its application was conducted in the clinical context of Takiwasi. Open-ended and semi-structured interviews with Awaj\u00fan informants and Takiwasi's therapeutic staff were performed and analyzed following the narrative methodological approach. Further clinical data on the ingestion of purgahuasca by Takiwasi's SUD patients were obtained from the internal repository. These indicate that 359 (92.1%) patients reported having had the so-called <i>mareaci\u00f3n</i> (dizziness), 299 (76.7%) experienced physical sensations, and 208 (53.3%) had visions. These effects can be related to the psychoactivity of \u03b2-Carbolines alkaloids from <i>B. caapi</i>, a medicinal plant that seems to have potential benefits also for SUD, especially giving a key contribution to the patients' therapeutic process of becoming aware of the personal reasons behind addictive behaviors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1185-8569"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department, Center for Drug Addiction Treatment and Research on Traditional Medicines - Takiwasi, Tarapoto, Peru."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti Scalo, Italy."}], "LastName": "Politi", "ForeName": "Matteo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department, Center for Drug Addiction Treatment and Research on Traditional Medicines - Takiwasi, Tarapoto, Peru."}], "LastName": "Friso", "ForeName": "Fabio", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department, Center for Drug Addiction Treatment and Research on Traditional Medicines - Takiwasi, Tarapoto, Peru."}], "LastName": "Saucedo", "ForeName": "Gary", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Department, Center for Drug Addiction Treatment and Research on Traditional Medicines - Takiwasi, Tarapoto, Peru."}], "LastName": "Torres", "ForeName": "Jaime", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Psychoactive Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "8113536", "ISSNLinking": "0279-1072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Banisteriopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32985365", "10.1080/02791072.2020.1820641"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
