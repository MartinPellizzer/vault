There are few studies on the genetic factors that can influence vitamin D levels. In particular, the data from twin and family-based studies have reported that circulating vitamin D concentrations are partially determined by genetic factors. Moreover, it has been shown that genetic variants (e.g., mutation) and alteration (e.g., deletion, amplification, inversion) in genes involved in the metabolism, catabolism, transport, or binding of vitamin D to it receptor, might affect vitamin D level. However, the underlying genetic determinants of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D] concentrations remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, the association between epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and vitamin D level has now been reported in several studies. The aim of current review was to provide an overview of the possible value of loci associated to vitamin D metabolism, catabolism, and transport as well epigenetic modification and environmental factors influencing vitamin D status."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrami", "ForeName": "Afsane", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabatabaeizadeh", "ForeName": "Seyed-Amir", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Complementary and Chinese Medicine, Persian and Complementary Medicine Faculty, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahrami-Taghanaki", "ForeName": "Hamidreza", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Modern Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Behboodi", "ForeName": "Negin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biostatistics & Epidemiology, School of Health, Management & Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Habibollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Medical Education, Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Falmer, Sussex BN1 9PH, Brighton, UK."}], "LastName": "Ferns", "ForeName": "Gordon A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5947-8904"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mobarhan", "ForeName": "Majid Ghayour", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4968-0962"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-16-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin D"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P6YZ13C99Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcifediol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Calcifediol"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin D Deficiency"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29030989", "10.1002/jcp.26216"]}}]}
