The obtained fractions were analysed by GC-MS and reversed-phase HPLC. The yield of essential oil achieved by a 30-min extraction with pure CO2 at 90 atm and 40 degrees C was 4.4 times higher than that produced by steam distillation performed for 4 h. The recovery of the flavonoid apigenin obtained by supercritical CO2 after a 30-min extraction at 200 atm and 40 degrees C was 71.4% compared to Soxhlet extraction performed for 6 h and 124.6% compared to maceration performed for 3 days. However, the highly polar flavonoid apigenin-7-glucoside was not extracted by 100% CO2 (recovery values < 1.1%). Its extraction efficiency was markedly improved by the addition of the polar modifier methanol (5%, v/v) to the CO2 fluid, yet the obtained recoveries were unsatisfactory (14.6-19.5%). The SFE method was scaled-up for preparative applications using a pilot plant with three separation stages operating in series. Large-scale SFE was technically feasible with pure CO2 as the extracting fluid. However, the use of CO2 modified with organic solvents was not effective at the pilot-plant scale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Italy. sls@unife.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scalia", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Giuffreda", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pallado", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10701421", "10.1016/s0731-7085(99)00152-1", "S0731-7085(99)00152-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
