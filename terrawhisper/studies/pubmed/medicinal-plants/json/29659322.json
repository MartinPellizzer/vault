In present study, a new sensitive and robust assay using Fourier Transform Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) combined with partial least square (PLS) multivariate methods has been developed for detection and quantification of saccharin adulteration in different commercial fruit juice samples. For this investigation, six different commercially available fruit juice samples were intentionally adulterated with saccharin at the following percentage levels: 0%, 0.10%, 0.30%, 0.50%, 0.70%, 0.90%, 1.10%, 1.30%, 1.50%, 1.70% and 2.00% (weight/volume). Altogether, 198 samples were used including 18 pure juice samples (unadulterated) and 180 juice samples adulterated with saccharin. PLS multivariate methods including partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least-squares regressions (PLSR) were applied to the obtained spectral data to build models. The PLS-DA model was employed to differentiate between pure fruit juice samples and those adulterated with saccharin. The R<sup>2</sup> value obtained for the PLS-DA model was 97.90% with an RMSE error of 0.67%. Similarly, a PLS regression model was also developed to quantify the amount of saccharin adulterant in juice samples. The R<sup>2</sup> value obtained for the PLSR model was 97.04% with RMSECV error of 0.88%. The employed model was then cross-validated by using a test set which included 30% of the total adulterated juice samples. The excellent performance of the model was proved by the low root mean squared error of prediction value of 0.92% and the high correlation factor of 0.97. This newly developed method is robust, nondestructive, highly sensitive and economical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Mabood", "ForeName": "Fazal", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Javid", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Chemistry , University of Malakand , Chakdara , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jabeen", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Allaham", "ForeName": "Batoul", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Albroumi", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Alghawi", "ForeName": "Said", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Alameri", "ForeName": "Saif", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Gilani", "ForeName": "Syed A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Al-Harrasi", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Haq", "ForeName": "Quazi M I", "Initials": "QMI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Saima", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "101485040", "ISSNLinking": "1944-0057"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "FST467XS7D", "NameOfSubstance": "Saccharin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit and Vegetable Juices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29659322", "10.1080/19440049.2018.1457802"]}}]}
