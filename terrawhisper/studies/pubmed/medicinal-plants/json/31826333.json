They enjoy a limited distribution in the plant kingdom and predominantly occur in several genera of Solanaceae. Of which, the genus Physalis is an important resource for this type of natural molecules. The present review aims to comprehensively illustrate the structural characteristics and classification of withanolides, and particularly focus on the progression on phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of withanolides from Physalis ranging from January 2015 to June 2019.", "Approximately 351 natural withanolides with novel and unique structures have so far been identified from genus Physalis, mainly isolated from the species of P.\u00a0angulata and P.\u00a0peruviana. Withanolides demonstrated diverse biological activity, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunoregulatory, trypanocidal and leishmanicidal activity. Their observed pharmacological functions supported the uses of Physalis species in traditional or folk medicines.", "Due to their unique structure skeleton and potent bioactivities, withanolides are regarded to be promising drug candidates, particularly for developing anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents.
