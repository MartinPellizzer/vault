At present, Xi-Xian-Tong-Shuan capsule is predominantly used in patients with acute cerebral ischemia; however, its protective effect on CCH has rarely been reported.", "To explore the underlying mechanisms by which Xi-Xian-Tong-Shuan capsule alleviates cognitive impairment caused by CCH.", "A model of CCH was established in specific-pathogen-free (SPF)-grade male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). Xi-Xian-Tong-Shuan capsules were intragastrically administered for 42 days after the BCCAO surgery. We then assessed for changes in cognitive function, expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and coagulation function as well as for the presence of white matter lesions and neuronal loss. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze the experimental data.", "The rats showed significant cognitive dysfunction after the BCCAO surgery along with white matter lesions, a loss of neurons, and elevated levels of inflammatory factors, all of which were significantly reversed after intervention with Xi-Xian-Tong-Shuan capsules.", "Xi-Xian-Tong-Shuan capsules can ameliorate vascular cognitive impairment in CCH rats by preventing damage of white matter, reducing neuronal loss, and inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory factors.
