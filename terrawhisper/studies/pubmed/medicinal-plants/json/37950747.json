From the ethanol extract of a whole <i>P. pellucida</i> plant, one previously undescribed carotane sesquiterpene (pellucarotine), one known carotane sesquiterpene (daucol), and one phenylpropanoid (dillapiol) were isolated and structurally elucidated. Their structures were determined based on 1D and 2D NMR, HR-ESI-Mass, experimental, and computational electronic circular dichroism spectroscopic data and compared with those reported in the literature. Antimicrobial assay results showed that pellucarotine had an anti-infective effect on <i>Candida albicans</i> with an MIC of 512\u2009\u00b5g/mL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1977-9272"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Ngo", "ForeName": "Quynh-Mai Thi", "Initials": "QT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Thi Tran", "ForeName": "Ngan", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen Thi Thu", "ForeName": "Phuong", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry and Standardization, National Institute of Medicinal Materials, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Thi", "ForeName": "Thu Nguyen", "Initials": "TN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry and Standardization, National Institute of Medicinal Materials, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen Manh", "ForeName": "Khoa", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen Van", "ForeName": "Hung", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Pham Van", "ForeName": "Linh", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical - Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Group, Hai Phong University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Haiphong, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Nguyen Van", "ForeName": "Khai", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37950747", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2280923"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
