In previous studies different species of Equisetum showed several phenolic compounds. The objective of this study was, for the first time, based on phytochemistry analysis to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The 70% ethanolic and methanolic extracts of E. hyemale were characterized by spectrophotometric and high-performance liquid chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector analyses, as well as its antioxidant potential based on the scavenger activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). In addition was verified the antimicrobial activity by broth microdilution technique against bacteria and fungi. The extracts showed phytochemical similarity, which demonstrated the presence of phenolic compounds, the scavenging activity for free radicals was about 30% and was observed better antifungal activity against dermatophyte fungi, with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of 0.62\u2009mg/mL to Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum canis. The extracts exhibits great potential to therapeutic applications or product development, since both possess antifungal activity and antioxidant action associated with little difference in their phytochemical composition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Drugs and Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "de Queiroz", "ForeName": "Geisiany M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Drugs and Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Politi", "ForeName": "Fl\u00e1vio A S", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Drugs and Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Rodrigues", "ForeName": "Edv\u00e2nio R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Drugs and Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Souza-Moreira", "ForeName": "Tatiana M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Natural Active Principles and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Moreira", "ForeName": "Raquel R D", "Initials": "RR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Chemistry of Natural Products, Institute of Chemistry of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Cardoso", "ForeName": "C\u00e1ssia R P", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Chemistry of Natural Products, Institute of Chemistry of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "Lourdes C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Drugs and Medicines, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Araraquara, UNESP-Univ Estadual Paulista , Araraquara, Brazil ."}], "LastName": "Pietro", "ForeName": "Rosemeire C L R", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arthrodermataceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25587637", "10.1089/jmf.2014.0089"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
