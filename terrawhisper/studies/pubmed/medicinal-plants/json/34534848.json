Contact time, eluent kind and volume, pH, the mass of the MMIP were all taken into consideration as key factors. Design expert and multi-objective response surface methodology (RSM) were used to optimize these variables. The mass of the MMIP, sample pH, eluent kind, time of sorption, the volume of eluent, and time of elution were 10\u00a0mg, 6, acetonitrile, 28\u00a0min, 200\u00a0\u00b5L, and 5.5\u00a0min, respectively, for the maximum extraction recovery of the analytes. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.042\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> at the optimal conditions, while the value for the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.140\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>. At the optimized conditions for thymol and carvacrol, the suggested MMIP sorbent had sorption capacities of 64.1 and 72.6\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Furthermore, for triplicate measurements, the linear dynamic range (LDR) was 0.40-5000\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, and the method's accuracy (RSD %) was 6.26%. The saturation magnetization for the MMIP was 19.0 emu g<sup>-1</sup> obtained by VSM, allowing the sorbent to be separated quickly. The sorption experiments confirmed the large sorption capacity of the MMIP for thymol and carvacrol, as well as its homogeneous binding sites. The extraction recovery for thymol and carvacrol was 96.9-103.8% and 96.6-105.4%, respectively, at all spiked amounts (20, 100, 200, and 500\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>). The findings of seven desorption-regeneration cycles using MMIP demonstrated the high stability of the sorbent. The MMIP revealed a particular behavior of sorption for thymol and carvacrol, implying a selective, simple, effective, and flexible analytical method."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
