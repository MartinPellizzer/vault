(CQ) against human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cell line and in silico analysis of selected active agents against apoptosis executioner enzyme caspase-3.", "Cell viability was analyzed in HeLa cells at different concentrations (25-300 \u03bcg/ml) of CQ extract. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cellular apoptosis, cell cycle analysis and caspases-3 activation were evaluated. In silico, structure-based virtual screening analysis was carried out using AutoDock Vina and iGEMDOCK.", "Cell viability of HeLa cells was reduced significantly (p < 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner, however, CQ extract showed non-toxic to normal kidney epithelial NRK-52E cells. CQ extract induced the intracellular ROS level, nuclear condensation and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) with the induction of annexin V-FITC positive cells. CQ extract arrested cells in G0/G1 and G2/M checkpoints and activated caspase-3 activity significantly in HeLa cells. The molecular docking study showed a strong binding affinity of CQ phytocomponents against the caspase-3 (PDB ID: 1GFW) protein of human apoptosis. PASS analyses of selected active components using Lipinski's Rule of five showed promising results. Further, drug-likeness and toxicity assessment using OSIRIS Data Warrior V5.2.1 software exhibited the feasibility of phytocomponents as drug candidates with no predicted toxicity.", "This study suggested that active constituents in CQ extract can be considered as potential chemotherapeutic candidates in the management of cervical cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Era's Lucknow Medical College &amp; Hospital, Era University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Sahabjada", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Interdisciplinary Biotechnology Unit, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Zia", "ForeName": "Qamar", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Era University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Personalized and Molecular Medicine, Era University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Sushma", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Lucknow, Lucknow 226007, India."}], "LastName": "Jafri", "ForeName": "Asif", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow 226003, India."}], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "Deepika", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department, Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ahamed", "ForeName": "Maqusood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Shibli National (PG) College, Azamgarh 276001, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mohd S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh 202002, India."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cissus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33568037", "10.2174/1871520621666210210103729", "ACAMC-EPUB-114069"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
