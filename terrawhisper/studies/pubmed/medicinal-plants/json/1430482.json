Eighteen Holstein cows were fed diets based on pea with triticale, pearl millet, or alfalfa plus corn silages. Dry matter digestibility of the pea with triticale diet was higher than for control (71.1 vs. 66.9%), but DM digestibility was not different between control and pearl millet diets. Milk production was not affected by diets containing pea with triticale or pearl millet compared with control diets (25.2, 23.2, and 24.5 kg/d). Cows fed pea with triticale produced milk with a higher concentration of fat (4.59 vs. 3.35%) and more FCM (27.3 vs. 22.1 kg/d) than those fed the control diet. However, cows fed the control diet gained more BW than those receiving pea with triticale or pearl millet diets. Partitioning of energy between body stores and milk production was different between cows fed pea with triticale and control diets; however, total energy use was not different (32.4 vs. 30.5 Mcal of NE(L)/d). Differences in energy partitioning may have been caused partly by differences in ruminal fermentation of the respective diets."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dairy Science, Ohio State University, Wooster 44691."}], "LastName": "Messman", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weiss", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Henderlong", "ForeName": "P R", "Initials": "PR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shockey", "ForeName": "W L", "Initials": "WL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1430482", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(92)78040-0", "S0022-0302(92)78040-0"]}}]}
