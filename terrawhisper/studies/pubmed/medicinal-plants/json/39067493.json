It infects more than 500 host plant species belonging to 100 families. Many important oil-seed and leguminous crops are known to be attacked by this devastating plant pathogen. In the present study, antifungal potential of flowers of a leguminous tree Acacia nilotica subsp. indica, was assessed against this pathogen through bioassays guided fractionation. Initially, methanolic extracts of 1\u00a0%-5\u00a0% of leaf, flower, root-bark and stem-bark of the plant species under consideration were evaluated for their antifungal potential against the target pathogen. Among these, the best antifungal activity was shown by flower extract. The reduction in growth of the test fungal strain was 27-49\u00a0%, 4-40\u00a0% and 2-27\u00a0% due to flower, root-bark and leaf extracts, respectivey, over control. Flower extract was partitioned using n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol as the solvents. Bioassays guided study of these fractions of methanolic extract of flower revealed that high antifungal potential was shown by n-hexane and chloroform fractions against M. phaseolina causing 26-53\u00a0% and 28-50\u00a0% decline in fungal biomass, respectively, as compared to that of control. GC-MS analysis of chloroform fraction revealed the presence of 27 compounds in this fraction. Among these cyclopentanol,-1-methyl (10.93\u00a0%) was the predominant compound followed by methyl, 4,4-dimethyl butanoate (7.04\u00a0%), 1-pentanol (6.80\u00a0%), 2-propanol, 1-cyclopropyl (6.11\u00a0%), 1H,imidazole-4-5-dihydro-2-methyl (5.93\u00a0%), trichloroethane (5.91\u00a0%), carbonic acid-ethyl hexyl ester (4.59\u00a0%), 1,4-butandiol,2,3-bis(methylene)- (4.54\u00a0%) and [S]-3,4-dimethyl pentanol (4.48\u00a0%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Lushan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Science.
