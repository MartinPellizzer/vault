Herein, we report geranylation of eight chalcones by the <i>Aspergillus terreus</i> aromatic prenyltransferase AtaPT. Ten new mono-geranylated enzyme products (<b>1G</b>-<b>5G</b>, <b>6G1</b>, <b>6G2</b>, <b>7G</b>, <b>8G1</b>, and <b>8G2</b>) were obtained. Most of the products are <i>C</i>-geranylated products with prenyl moieties at ring B. In comparison, plant aromatic prenyltransferases usually catalyze the geranylation at ring A. Therefore, AtaPT can be used complementarily for chalcone geranylation to increase the structural diversity of small molecules. In addition, seven compounds (<b>1G</b>, <b>3G</b>, <b>4G</b>, <b>6G1</b>, <b>7G</b>, <b>8G1</b>, and <b>8G2</b>) exhibited a potential inhibitory effect on \u03b1-glucosidase with the IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 45.59 \u00b1 3.48 to 82.85 \u00b1 2.15 \u03bcg/mL. Among them, compound <b>7G</b> (45.59 \u00b1 3.48 \u03bcg/mL) was the most potential \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, which is about seven times stronger than the positive control acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub> = 346.63 \u00b1 15.65 \u03bcg/mL)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Linlan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Centre for R&D of Fine Chemicals, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4583-2655"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie und Biotechnologie, Fachbereich Pharmazie, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Robert-Koch-Str. 4, Marburg 35037, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shu-Ming", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3550-161X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Chun-Mao", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Green Pesticide and Agricultural Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Centre for R&D of Fine Chemicals, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6826-987X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylallyltranstransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylallyltranstransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36893066", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c08743"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
