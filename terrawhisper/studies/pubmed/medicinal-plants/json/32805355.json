Various medicinal plants used in folk medicine have demonstrated wound healing and antimicrobial properties, and some of these species are currently used in commercial preparations. Despite the well-documented and rich tradition of the use of local herbs for the treatment of skin injuries in Samoan folk medicine, their wound healing potential has not yet been systematically studied.", "Investigation into the in vitro antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts from 14 medicinal plants used in Samoan traditional medicine for the healing of wounds, burns and sores, and their effects on the proliferation and migration of human fibroblasts.", "The antibacterial activity of these extracts was tested against pathogens associated with infected skin injuries, using the broth microdilution method. The effect on migration, proliferation and viability of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated using wound healing scratch assay, cell proliferation assay, and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity test.", "The extracts from Cerbera manghas, Commelina diffusa, Kleinhovia hospita, Mikania micrantha, Omalanthus nutans, Peperomia pellucida, Phymatosorus scolopendria, Piper graeffei, Psychotria insularum, and Schizostachyum glaucifolium inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \u22654\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, whereas C. manghas and P. pellucida produced the same MIC against both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Among the antibacterially active species, C. diffusa, K. hospita, P. scolopendria, P. insularum, and S. glaucifolium did not produce toxicity towards the standard line of normal adult human dermal fibroblasts (IC<sub>80</sub>\u00a0>\u00a0128\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). In addition, extracts from Barringtonia asiatica, C. manghas, M. micrantha, O. nutans, P. insularum, and Piper graeffei stimulated significant migration of dermal fibroblasts, while M. micrantha, O. nutans, and P. insularum did not affect cell proliferation at a concentration of 32\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.", "The results suggest that the above-mentioned species of Samoan medicinal plants can be used for the development of new wound healing agents. However, further phytochemical and pharmacological research is needed regarding the isolation and identification of their active constituents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
