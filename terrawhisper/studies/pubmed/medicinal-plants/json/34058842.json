In June 2019, symptoms of leaf spots on sweetgum were observed in a field (5 ha) located in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. On this field, approximately 45% of 1,000 trees showed the same symptoms. Symptoms were observed showing irregular or circular dark brown necrotic lesions approximately 5 to 15 mm in diameter with a yellowish margin on the leaves. To isolate the pathogen, diseased leaf sections (4\u00d74mm) were excised from the margin of the lesion, surface-sterilized with 0.1% NaOCl for 90 s, rinsed 4 times in sterile distilled water, air dried and then transferred on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 25\u00b0C in the dark. Pure cultures were obtained by monospore isolation after subculture. Ten purified isolates, named FXI to FXR, were transferred to fresh PDA and incubated as above to allow for morphological and molecular identification. After 7 days, the aerial mycelium was abundant, fluffy and exhibited white to greyish-green coloration. The conidia were dark brown or olive, solitary or produced in chains, obclavate, with 1 to 15 pseudosepta, and measured 45 to 200\u00b5m \uf0b4 10 to 18\u00b5m. Based on morphological features, these 10 isolates were identified as <i>Corynespora cassiicola</i> (Ellis et al. 1971). Genomic DNA of each isolate was extracted from mycelia using the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. The EF-1\u03b1 gene and ITS region were amplified and sequenced with the primer pairs rDNA ITS primers (ITS4/ITS5) (White et al. 1990) and EF1-728F/EF-986R (Carbone et al.1999) respectively. The sequences were deposited in GenBank. BLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequence had 99.66% similarity to <i>C. cassiicola</i> MH255527 and that the EF-1\u03b1 sequence had 100% similarity to <i>C. cassiicola</i> KX429668A. maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on EF-1\u03b1 and ITS sequences using MEGA 7 revealed that ten isolates were placed in the same clade as C. cassiicola (Isolate: XQ3-1; accession numbers: MH572687 and MH569606, respectively) at 98% bootstrap support. Based on the morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses, all isolates were identified as <i>C. cassiicola.</i> For the pathogenicity test, a 10 \u00b5l conidial suspension (1\u00d7105 spores/ml) of each isolate was dripped onto healthy leaves of 2-year-old sweetgum potted seedlings respectively. Leaves inoculated with sterile water served as controls. Three plants (3 leaves per plant) were conducted for each treatment. The experiment was repeat twice. All seedlings were enclosed in plastic transparent incubators to maintain high relative humidity (90% to 100%) and incubated in a greenhouse at 25\u00b0C with a 12-h photoperiod. After 10 days, leaves inoculated with conidial suspension of each isolate showed symptoms of leaf spots, similar to those observed in the field. Control plants were remained healthy. In order to reisolate the pathogen, surface-sterilized and monosporic isolation was conducted as described above. The same fungus was reisolated from the lesions of symptomatic leaves, and its identity was confirmed by molecular and morphological approaches, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. Chlorothalonil and Boscalid can be used to effectively control <i>Corynespora</i> leaf spot (Chairin T et al.2017). To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by <i>C. cassiicola</i> on <i>L. styraciflua</i> in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing, Jiangsu, China; 444060750@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Yun-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Forestry, Nanjing Forestry University, No. 159 long pan Road, Nanjing , Jiangsu, China, 210037."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States; Zhengxr@njfu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xiang-Rong", "Initials": "XR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanjing Forestry University, 74584, College of Forestry, No.159, Longpan Road, Xuanwu District, Nanjing, China, 210037."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States; cfengmao@njfu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Fengmao", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["34058842", "10.1094/PDIS-08-20-1842-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
