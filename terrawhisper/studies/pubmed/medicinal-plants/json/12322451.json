Forests are the main home of Earth's species. They cover only 6% of the planet's land surface, and 50% of them are tropical forests inhabited by possibly 70% and conceivably 90% of all species. Aside from their being a habitat, these forests contain plants that have been known to contribute to our health. Analgesics, antibiotics, contraceptives are some of the few byproducts of plants in tropical forests. In addition, tropical forests contribute environmental services even more valuable than the material goods they produce. Most significant of these are watershed services, wherein deforestation of upland catchments can lead to disruption of hydrological systems, causing year-round water flows in downstream areas to give way to flood-and-drought regimes. Moreover, forests have a role in carbon sinking and hence in mitigating global warming. Depletion of forests through deforestation as well as forest fires could lead to an increased rate of die-off in remaining forests in other parts of the world, plus a decline of biomass in other ecological zones such as grasslands."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["148111", "00292282"], "GeneralNote": ["POPEN.
