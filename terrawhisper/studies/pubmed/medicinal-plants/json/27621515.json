The former treatise deals with the diagnosis of diseases while the latter with the treatment using medicinal plants and other recipes. In M\u0101dhava Cikits\u0101, a common Sanskrit name is found to describe two or more totally different botanical plant species (thus leading to ambiguity) and a distinct botanical species is also found to represent two or more Sanskrit names at several instances.", "The present paper deals with the correct botanical identification (most probable) of Sanskrit named plants described in M\u0101dhava Cikits\u0101 for the treatment of Diarrhoea (Atis\u0101ra Cikits\u0101).", "The authentic manuscripts of 'M\u0101dhava Cikits\u0101' were critically studied for the present research outcome. A detailed literature survey is carried out from various references and texts.", "The list of Sanskrit named plants contains 103 names, while after the critical study and assigning the most probable botanical identification as per ICBN, the list of plant species described in the text for the treatment of Diarrhoea is found to contain 73 names.", "The present study will certainly benefit Ayurvedic medical practitioners and pharmaceutical companies in selection of proper plant species avoiding substitutions for drug formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Jamkhed Mahavidyalaya, Jamkhed, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Salve", "ForeName": "Niteen Ramdas", "Initials": "NR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Sub-centre Latur of Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Debendranath", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kapoor LD.
