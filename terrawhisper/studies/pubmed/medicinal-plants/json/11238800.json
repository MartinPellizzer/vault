Dietary therapy is the first step in the treatment of hyperlipidemia; garlic has been used medicinally for centuries and is still included in the traditional medicine of many cultures. Historically, there has been great interest in the role of garlic in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. Evidence from numerous studies points to the fact that garlic can bring about the normalization of plasma lipids, enhancement of fibrinolytic activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation and reduction of blood pressure and glucose. However, some contradictory results have also emerged as a result of methodological shortcomings, the use of different formulations/preparations of garlic and different time scales of the studies. Accordingly, further clinical studies are required in which standardized formulations of garlic with known compositions can be used. Such formulations (e.g., Aged Garlic Extract) are now available and are being investigated. Evidence obtained from these studies indicates that garlic has potential in the prevention and control of cardiovascular disorders and is beneficial when taken as a dietary supplement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomolecular Sciences, Liverpool John Moore University, Liverpool L3 3AF, UK."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}], "NumberOfReferences": "29"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11238800", "10.1093/jn/131.3.977S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
