It is native to Indonesia and Malaysia and widely distributed in countries including Northeast India, China, Peninsular Malaysia and Java. Due to vide pharmacological values, it is necessary to recognize this species for its significance of pharmacological importance. This article provides the botanical characteristics, chemical compounds of vegetation, ethnopharmacological values, therapeutic properties, along with the potential pesticidal properties of this important medicinal plant. The information in this article was gathered by searching the online journals in the databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science etc. The terms such as Alpinia malaccensis, Malacca ginger, Rankihiriya, pharmacology, chemical composition, ethnopharmacology, etc., were used in different combinations. A detailed study of the available resources for A. malaccensis confirmed its native and distribution, traditional values, chemical properties, and medicinal values. Its essential oils and extracts are the reservoir of a wide range of important chemical constituents. Traditionally, it is being used to treat nausea, vomiting and wounds along with as a seasoning agent in meat processing and as perfume. Apart from traditional values, it has been reported for several pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory etc. We believe that this review will help to provide the collective information of A. malaccensis to further explore it in the prevention and treatment of various diseases and help to the systematic study of this plant to utilize its potential in various areas of human welfare."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2628-1747"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, G.B.
