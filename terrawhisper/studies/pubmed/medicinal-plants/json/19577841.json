The effects of arsenic (As) on the growth and the formation of pharmaceutical components of S. baicalensis, and the uptake and accumulation of As by S. baicalensis were investigated using a field pot-culture experiment. The results show that spiking low concentrations of As (</=100mgkg(-1)) into soils can hasten the growth and development of the roots. High levels of As, however, reduced plant growth. The concentrations of five flavone components were not significantly affected by spiking low concentrations of As (</=200mgkg(-1)) into soils. High levels of As inhibited the generation of baicalin and wogoninside, but facilitated the generation of baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A in S. baicalensis Georgi. The concentration of As in each part of the plant was proportional to the concentration of As spiked into the soil. The application of phosphorus (P) to the soil promoted the uptake and accumulation of As in the roots of the plant, but this synergistic effect became weaker with the incremental addition of P. Dry biomass did not change in response to low levels of P addition (</=200mgkg(-1)) to soils, but it increased significantly under high levels of P. Based on the results of both this pot-culture experiment and human health risk assessments, maximum safety limits of 2.0mgkg(-1) of As in the roots of S. baicalensis Georgi and 70mgkg(-1) of As in cultivated soils are suggested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijing Area Major Laboratory of Protection and Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100875, China. caohongbin@ires.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Hongbin", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jianjiang", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wensheng", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Hazard Mater", "NlmUniqueID": "9422688", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Restoration and Remediation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19577841", "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.06.022", "S0304-3894(09)00943-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
