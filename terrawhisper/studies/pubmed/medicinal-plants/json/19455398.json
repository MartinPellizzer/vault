In dipping technique, larvae were immersed in the concentrations of plant extracts for 30 seconds. However, in thin film technique, larvae were exposed to thin layer from each plant extract in the Petri-dishes. Results showed that all extracts had toxic effects on larvae in both two treatments. Hexane and diethyl ether extracts of A. herba-alba and ethyl acetate extract of A. monosperma recorded the highest effect in both two treatments. Ethanol extracts of E. aegyptiaca and A. monosperma were the highest in dipping and thin film treatments, respectively. In dipping treatment, most plant extracts revealed extending effect on pupae especially while in thin film treatment most larvae which succeeded to develop to pupae produced normal flies. Deformed pupae were only recorded with the high concentration of diethyl extracts of A. herba-alba. Hexane, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate extracts of F. crespa only produced low percentages of deformed flies. Histological examination conducted on larvae confirmed that extracts in thin film treatment penetrated to the gut and destroyed its epithelial cells and wall. It concluded that the crude extracts of the four tested plants can be used in controlling of C. albiceps larvae while hexane extracts of E. aegyptiaca, A. herba-alba and A. monosperma are considered the most promising plant preparations against the larvae by using thin film technique."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Animal Diseases, Veterinary Research Division, National Research Center, Dokki, Giza, Egypt. aasobhy@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Shafy", "ForeName": "Sobhy", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "El-Khateeb", "ForeName": "Rabab M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soliman", "ForeName": "Mahmoud M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Aziz", "ForeName": "Mohamed M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Trop Anim Health Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "1277355", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4747"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiparasitic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2001 Apr;31(1):223-32", "ArticleIdList": ["12557945"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1991 Aug;21(2):539-46", "ArticleIdList": ["1875078"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1998 Apr;28(1):45-51", "ArticleIdList": ["9617041"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1999;29(1):91-100", "ArticleIdList": ["12561887"]}, {"Citation": "J Commun Dis. 2002 Dec;34(4):264-9", "ArticleIdList": ["14710857"]}, {"Citation": "J Econ Entomol. 2004 Oct;97(5):1581-6", "ArticleIdList": ["15568346"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1997 Dec;27(3):719-37", "ArticleIdList": ["9425818"]}, {"Citation": "Braz J Biol. 2006 Feb;66(1A):95-100", "ArticleIdList": ["16680310"]}, {"Citation": "J Med Entomol. 1970 Jan;7(1):46-64", "ArticleIdList": ["5435809"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1998 Dec;28(3):699-709", "ArticleIdList": ["9914694"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 1998 Aug;28(2):503-10", "ArticleIdList": ["9707679"]}, {"Citation": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2003 Apr;33(1):189-200", "ArticleIdList": ["12739811"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19455398", "10.1007/s11250-009-9373-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
