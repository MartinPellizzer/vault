In this context, medicinal plants represent an alternative source of active compounds for developing efficient antiviral therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of <i>Arisaema tortuosum</i>, a plant used in the traditional medicine of India. A chloroform soluble fraction of the leaves exhibited anti-HSV-2 activity with a selectivity index of 758. The extract was also active against acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 and HSV-1. The mechanism of action of the extract was investigated evidencing inhibition of both early and late events of the HSV-2 replicative cycle. A HPLC-PDA-MS/MS analysis showed the presence of flavonoids including apigenin and luteolin in the chloroform extract (CE). Apigenin and luteolin showed a high inhibitory activity with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.05 and 0.41\u2009\u00b5g/mL, respectively. Both compounds exhibited antiviral activity when added up to 6\u2009h post infection and were able to reduce the viral progeny production. In addition, apigenin interfered with cell-to-cell virus spread."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Orbassano, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ritt\u00e0", "ForeName": "Massimo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Science and Technology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Marengo", "ForeName": "Arianna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Orbassano, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Civra", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Orbassano, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Lembo", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Science and Technology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Cagliero", "ForeName": "Cecilia", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India."}], "LastName": "Kant", "ForeName": "Kamal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "Uma Ranjan", "Initials": "UR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Drug Science and Technology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Rubiolo", "ForeName": "Patrizia", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Technology, Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi, India."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Manik", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Torino, Orbassano, Torino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Donalisio", "ForeName": "Manuela", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arisaema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Simplex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 2, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31968380", "10.1055/a-1087-8303"]}}]}
