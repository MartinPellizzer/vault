Their structures were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis (1D, 2D NMR, and HRESIMS) and ECD calculation. Sulphurenolides A and B are a pair of C-20 epimer, and sulphurenolide B represents the first naturally occurring 20R-brassinosteroid. Moreover, sulphurenolides A-C are firstly reported 5-hydroxylation and homo-6-oxa derivatives of brassinosteroids from natural sources. Anti-inflammatory assay revealed that sulphurenolides B and C exhibited significant inhibitory effects on NO production in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW264.7 cells, and sulphurenolide C showed stronger inhibition than that of positive control, minocycline."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
