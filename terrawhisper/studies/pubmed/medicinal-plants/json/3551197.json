Marked weakness, hyporeflexia, hair bristling, ptosis, spinal deformity, weight loss and dypsnea were prominent signs. Mortality in mice given green fruit was 100% at all doses; with toxin T-514 the mortality was 100% at 45 mg/kg. One hundred and sixty-two necropsies were performed and major lesions were found in liver and lung. The pulmonary lesions consisted of progressive vascular congestion and hemorrhage. Alterations in liver consisted of congestion, hemorrhage, hepatocyte degeneration, central zone necrosis and acute diffuse necrosis. Green fruit was more toxic than ripe fruit and T-514 was more active than T-544."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bermudez", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonzalez-Spencer", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guerrero", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waksman", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pi\u00f1eyro", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicon", "NlmUniqueID": "1307333", "ISSNLinking": "0041-0101"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3551197", "10.1016/0041-0101(86)90135-2"]}}]}
