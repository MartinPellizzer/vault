We recently demonstrated that IR occurs at the pre-symptomatic state during the aging process of a mouse model of aging, providing a promising biomarker for that state, and can be restored to the normal state by juzentaihoto (JTT), a Japanese herbal medicine (Kampo) (Okada et al. 2021). Here we characterized the genes that accumulate retained introns, examined the biological significance of increased IR in these genes for the host, and determined whether drugs other than JTT can have this effect. By analyzing RNA-sequencing data generated from the hippocampus of the 19-week-old SAMP8 mouse, a model for studying age-related depression and Alzheimer's disease, we showed that genes with increased IR are generally involved in multiple metabolic pathways and have pivotal roles in sensing homeostasis. We thus propose that IR is a stress response and works to fine-tune the expression of many downstream target genes, leading to lower levels of their translation under stress conditions. Interestingly, Kampo medicines, as well as other organic compounds, restored splicing of a specific set of retained introns in these sensor genes in accordance with the physiological recovery conditions of the host, which corresponds with the recovery of transcripts represented by differentially expressed genes. Thus, analysis of IR genes may have broad applicability in evaluating the pre-symptomatic state based on the extent of IR of selective sensor genes, opening a promising early diagnosis of any diseases and a strategy for evaluating efficacies of several drugs based on the extent of IR restoration of these sensor genes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
