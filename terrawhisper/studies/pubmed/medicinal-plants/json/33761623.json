Because Polygoni multiflori Radix has a traditional medicinal use to treat intestinal diseases, and the water extract of this herbal medicine had a positive influence on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced UC model in our study. Meanwhile 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside (TSG) as the major component of the water extract of Polygoni multiflori Radix with yield of more than 10% exhibited the remarkable anti-inflammatory activity in vivo and in vitro, we predicted that TSG may contribute to benefit intestinal tract presented by the water extract of Polygoni multiflori Radix. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the pharmacological effect of this compound on UC model and its possible mechanism to regulate intestinal function through gut microbiota.", "Ulcerative colitis model was established in BALb/c mice by continuously administrating 3% (w/v) DSS aqueous solution for one week. The disease activity index (DAI), colon length, histopathological examination by H&E and the levels of tight junction proteins (TJP) by immunofluorescence staining were performed in ulcerative colitis model following the protocol. Furthermore, the levels of main inflammatory factors like TNF-\u03b1, IL-\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 were analyzed by the ELIZA kits for the further confirmation of anti-inflammatory activity of TSG on ulcerative colitis model. Finally, 16S rDNA sequencing technology was conducted to explore the composition and relative abundance of gut microbiota of different treatment groups.", "TSG treatments effectively increased body weight about 5% of those in DSS group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as well remarkably reduced the DAI scores to the 50% of those in DSS group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the UC model. TSG treatments of either 25\u00a0mg/kg (TSG-25) or 100\u00a0mg/kg (TSG-100) dosage restored epithelial barrier structure and exhibited obviously intact colon histology with reduced signs of inflammatory cells infiltration, preserved epithelia barrier, restored crypt structure, and increased numbers of goblet cells. TSG treatments could markedly lessen the histopathologic score two or three times than those in DSS group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Especially for TSG-100 treatment, the fluorescence intensity of ZO-1 and Occludin were nearly back to 80% of those in normal group, and were 1.5 times more than those in the DSS group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, direct evidence pointed to TSG as a therapeutically active molecule in the prevention and treatment of UC by significantly reducing the production of these pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05-0.001) and increasing the levels of anti-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine IL-10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05-0.001). Finally, it was found TSG treatments significantly raised the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with a dose-dependently and improved the homeostasis of the gut microbiota composition which disrupted by DSS through increasing genus level Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 and decreasing genus level of Helicobacter, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides.", "The present results suggested that TSG treatments had a desirable pharmacological effect on acute colitis induced by DSS in the mice as well showed the possible mechanism relate to improve the intestinal function through balancing the gut microbiota of intestinal flora."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
