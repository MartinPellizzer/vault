We investigated the effects of L-canavanine on performance and select metabolic responses of growing chicks. Canavanine was added to a control diet, in an amount equivalent to that provided by 300 g raw canavalia seeds/kg diet (10 g free base canavanine/kg diet). Growth, plasma basic amino acids and kidney arginase, activity were measured. The incorporation of canavanine into a nutritionally balanced diet for growing chicks depressed feed intake and growth by approximately 25% (P < 0.01) compared with the control diet. Performance was unaffected by equimolar amounts of arginine. Canavanine exerted its growth-depressing effect exclusively by reducing feed intake, because this effect was not observed in a pair-feeding experiment. Chicks fed a diet containing 473 mmol canavanine sulfate/kg for 11 d were given an intracrop dose of 946 mmol of canavanine sulfate or arginine hydrochloride. In both cases, plasma histidine and lysine concentrations were significantly decreased compared with a placebo group dosed with water. Plasma arginine concentration was unaffected by the canavanine sulfate dose but, as expected, was significantly increased by the arginine hydrochloride dose. Free base canavanine significantly (P < 0.05) reduced kidney arginase activity. No overt toxic effects were observed at any point during the study. These data indicate that, although canavanine is not the principal antinutritional factor in Canavalia ensiformis seeds, its presence in the diet precludes optimum performance of chicks."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departmento de Ciencias Fisiol\u00f3gicas, Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Maracay, Aragua."}], "LastName": "Michelangeli", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vargas", "ForeName": "R E", "Initials": "RE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3HZV514J4B", "NameOfSubstance": "Canavanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4QD397987E", "NameOfSubstance": "Histidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arginase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Canavanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Histidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8027859", "10.1093/jn/124.7.1081"]}}]}
