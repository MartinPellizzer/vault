Herein, we prepared a dual-responsive synergistic drug delivery nanoparticle carrier (NPS@Bai/Cip), which responds to sub-acid bacterial microenvironments and targets phosphatase or phospholipase at infection sites. Nanoparticles surfaces were positively (10.0\u2009mV) charged under acidic conditions, leading to good bacterial adhesion and enhanced drug accumulation. NPS@Bai/Cip showed good antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against drug-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. NPS@Bai/Cip could inhibit the biofilm formation <i>via</i> affecting the swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities of <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. NPS@Bai/Cip was used to treat drug-resistance <i>P. aeruginosa</i>-induced infection in rats by improving wound healing and reducing inflammatory responses. Thus, NPS@Bai/Cip functioned as an antibacterial and antibiofilm agent with good potential for treating bacteria-induced infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yujia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Province Hospital), Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Province Hospital), Nanjing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiufen", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Tianyu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8373-3530"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4333-9106"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiangchun", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomater Sci Polym Ed", "NlmUniqueID": "9007393", "ISSNLinking": "0920-5063"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36799915", "10.1080/09205063.2023.2182575"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
