First, their mental health profile was examined by a number of subjective and objective assessments. Second, the medical consumption of the users was studied with special attention to the psychotropic drugs prescribed. The prevalence of psychological problems and symptoms of psychological distress was higher among OTC-P users than among non-users. Somatic problems and symptoms were comparable in the two groups; social support was better in the OTC-P users. Half of the users were known to have mental health problems by their Primary Care Physician (PCP). The DSM IV Axis I disorders were mostly mood and anxiety disorders. A benzodiazepine had been prescribed to one-third of the OTC-P users. No other psychotropic drugs had been prescribed, and the medical consumption was comparable in the two groups. PCPs should be aware of concomitant OTC-Ps use."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University Medical Centre St Radboud, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Rijswijk", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van de Lisdonk", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zitman", "ForeName": "F G", "Initials": "FG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Gen Hosp Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "7905527", "ISSNLinking": "0163-8343"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12794-10-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzodiazepines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Benzodiazepines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depressive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10936630", "10.1016/s0163-8343(00)00078-5", "S0163-8343(00)00078-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
