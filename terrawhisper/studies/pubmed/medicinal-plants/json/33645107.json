However, given on the fact that traditional Chinese medicine is a multi-dimensional and complex system with multiple components, multiple pathways, multiple targets, and an unclear pharmacodynamic material basis, the research on the pharmacokinetics of traditio-nal Chinese medicine has become a scientific and technological problem. Although the pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicine has achieved remarkable development with the emergence of new theories, methods and technologies, there are still some problems in the application of the research direction of the pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicine judging from the current application of the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Therefore, this article discussed the current research status on pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicines by analyzing the projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in the past 5 years from 2016 to 2020, mainly including the application and funding analysis, main research contents of the projects in pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicines. And the research hotspots, difficulties and deficiencies were focused in order to provide certain reference for researchers engaged in pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science,National Natural Science Foundation of China Beijing 100085,China Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics in Guizhou,State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Provincial Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine,School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Zi-Peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science,National Natural Science Foundation of China Beijing 100085,China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences,Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine Guangzhou 510006,China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chao-Zhan", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Science,National Natural Science Foundation of China Beijing 100085,China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Li-Wei", "Initials": "LW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Financial Management"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Foundations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Natural Science Disciplines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645107", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210122.502"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
