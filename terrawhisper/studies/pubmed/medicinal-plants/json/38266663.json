Isoflavonoids, a type of secondary metabolite, have little cytotoxicity against healthy human cells, making them interesting candidates for cancer treatment. Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the chemo-preventive benefits of flavonoids in treating various cancers. Biochanin A (BA), an isoflavonoid abundant in plants such as red clover, soy, peanuts, and chickpeas, was the subject of our present study. This study aimed to determine how BA affected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in human lung cancer cells. The study provides meaningful insight and a significant impact of BA on the association between metastasis, inflammation, and G6PD inhibition in A549 cells. Comprehensive in vitro tests revealed that BA has anti-inflammatory effects. Molecular docking experiments shed light on BA's high binding affinity for the G6PD receptor. BA substantially decreased the expression of G6PD and other inflammatory and metastasis-related markers. In conclusion, our findings highlight the potential of BA as a therapeutic agent in cancer treatment, specifically by targeting G6PD and related pathways. BA's varied effects, which range from anti-inflammatory capabilities to metastasis reduction, make it an appealing option for future investigation in the development of new cancer therapeutics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
