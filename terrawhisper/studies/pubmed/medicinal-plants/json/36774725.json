However, medicinal plants are still a source of inspiration for the discovery of new treatments of several diseases, including diabetes. The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant and antidiabetic properties of Oxalis pes-caprae flowers extract in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The phytochemical and antioxidant activities of both aqueous and methanolic extracts were assessed by in-vitro testing such as free radical scavenging assays (DPPH and ABTS<sup>+</sup>), ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) chelating activity and reducing power assay. Additionally, the detection of Amadori products and advanced glycation end products was used to determine the antiglycation potential. \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory assessment was employed to determine the antidiabetic effect, while alloxan-induced diabetic mice were used to measure the in-vivo activities of antioxidants and carbohydrates enzymes. The effect of the methanolic extract on body weight and blood glucose level of extract-treated diabetic mice were also investigated. Among the tested extract, the methanolic extract was the richest in phenolic compounds which is directly related with their remarkable antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory and antiglycation activity. The oral administration of the two doses of Oxalis pes-caprae flowers (150\u00a0mg/kg and 250\u00a0mg/kg) daily for 3 weeks resulted in hypoglycemic effect compared to the reference drug, glibenclamide (10\u00a0mg/kg). Furthermore, the extract was shown to significantly increase the activities of antioxidants and glycolysis enzymes in the liver, kidney and spleen of diabetic mice, compared to diabetic control group. Therefore, Oxalis pes-caprae extract effectively exhibited hypoglycemic and antidiabetic effects as indicated by in-vitro and in-vivo studies, confirming the protective effects on hyperglycemia and oxidative damage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
