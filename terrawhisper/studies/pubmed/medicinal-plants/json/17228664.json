The growth curve line of Raji cells was drawn also by MTT assay. The cellular morphology was observed by invert microscope, Giemas staining and MTT assay. The expression of apoptosis related protein bcl-2, bax was measured by immunocytochemistry and the quantitative analysis was made with figure analysis system.", "1. Prunella vulgaris L. could obviously suppress the cell proliferation of Raji cells in a concentration-dependent manner (r = 0.97). The IC50 was 0.118 mg/ml. 2. After Raji cells was reacted with injection of Prunella vulgaris L.
