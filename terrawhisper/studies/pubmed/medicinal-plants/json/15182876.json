Complementary and alternative medicine sells, because in some cases it works as well or better than mainstream medicine. In addition, many practitioners of complementary medicine understand Hippocrates' aphorism: \"It is more important to know the person that has the disease than the disease the person has.\" It is important to recognize that spending time with the patient is often as therapeutic as drugs. CAM offers patients the time, touch, attention, and level of personal interaction that are increasingly uncommon in contemporary medical care. There is a major need for large and appropriately designed studies to test the effectiveness of complementary techniques. As in other areas of health care, studies in the elderly are consistently lacking. With the growing interest in CAM, it is important for medical providers to keep an open mind--to both the potential benefits and potential harms of alternative treatments. When treatments are shown to be dangerous or ineffective, we must educate the public and work to remove these therapies from the market place. When treatments are proven effective, Western and Eastern medical providers must work together with patients to provide the most appropriate and comprehensive health care."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Geriatric Medicine, Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center, MO 63104, USA. gammackj@slu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gammack", "ForeName": "Julie K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morley", "ForeName": "John E", "Initials": "JE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Geriatr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8603766", "ISSNLinking": "0749-0690"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geriatric Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hormone Replacement Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longevity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physical Therapy Modalities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}], "NumberOfReferences": "169"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15182876", "10.1016/j.cger.2004.02.006", "S0749069004000230"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
