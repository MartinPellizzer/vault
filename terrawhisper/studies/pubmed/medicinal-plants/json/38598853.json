DC. in Hubei Province of China.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The cultivated aromatic medicinal herb Atractylodes lancea (Thunb.) DC. is widely used in the pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and cosmetics industries (Na-Bangchang et al. 2014; Zhan et al. 2023). Huanggang in Hubei Province is a major production area for A. lancea (Huang et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2023). In April 2023, more than two-thirds of the surveyed plant leaves in this region exhibited virus-like symptoms, such as curling and mosaic patterns. To identify the underlying cause, 80 symptomatic plant leaf samples were collected from four fields (20 leaves per field) in this region and pooled for virome analysis. Total RNA, including ribosomal RNA, was extracted from the pooled samples using the Plant RNA Extraction Mini Kit (Onrew Biotech, Guangdong, China), for sequencing library construction. The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform was used to sequence the library and generate 150 bp paired-end reads. After processing the raw data with Trimmomatic software, a total of 44,354,650 high-quality clean reads were obtained. The clean reads were aligned against ribosomal RNA using BWA software (v0.7.17) to avoid interference and eliminate corresponding sequences. After removing potential contamination, contig assembly of the clean reads was performed using Megahit software (v1.2.9). The resulting contigs were compared with the virus NT database using the BLASTn program. Sequence pairwise comparison revealed 8 contigs (574 nt to 2243 nt) with identities ranging from 81.88% to 90.77% with Atractylodes mild mottle virus (AMMV, NC_027924.1, Lim et al., 2015). Additionally, contigs mapped to Carlavirus, Pelarspovirus, and other plant viruses in our virome dataset had low coverage and pairwise identity (less than 70%), which need to be further investigated. The presence of AMMV was confirmed by aligning the clean reads to the reference sequence (NC_027924.1) using BWA and SAMtools software, resulting in a consensus sequence (8024 nt) with gaps. DNA extraction from the pooled samples was performed using the Rapid Universal Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (Simgen, Zhejiang, China). Two pairs of specific primers, 3399F (5'-AAAGAAGAACCTCCTGATACGG-3')/5924R (5'-TGAACCTGATTCTCTTGGC-3') and 1830F (5'- CTCAGGAAATCCCAATGC -3')/3640R(5'-TTTCCCAATGTTCTTCGGG-3'), were designed to amplify the complete gene sequences of polymerase and coat protein (CP), based on the consensus sequence. The PCR products with the lengths of 2521 bp and 1814 bp were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara Biotech, Dalian, China) for sequencing. The BLASTn analysis showed that the polymerase and CP gene sequences shared an identity of 94.51% (1929/2041 nt) and 88.41% (1419/1605 nt) with the AMMV isolate (NC_027924.1), respectively. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers OR544810 and OR544811. We collected leaves from 32 A. lancea plants (16 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic) in the fields. RT-PCR was conducted using CPF (5'-CTGCGAATATGAAAGTGC-3') and CPR (5'-GGTGAGCTTGTCTGTTAGG-3') primers, which were designed targeting a 527bp fragment of the CP gene (OR544811). Amplicons of the expected size (527bp) were detected in 24 plants (11 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic), three of which were sequenced by Sanger sequencing, showing a 100% match to OR544811. These findings indicate that AMMV is prevalent in the major production area of A. lancea. Further research is needed to better characterize the potential risks of AMMV to A. lancea cultivation in China as well as other countries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, 240515, 16 Huangjiahu West Road, Hongshan District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, Wuhan, China, 430065; 1546155942@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 1261089410@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 1287920751@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, 240515, College of Pharmacy, The west NO.1 of Huangjiahu Road, wuhan, China, 430065."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, 240515, Hubei Key Laboratory of Resources and Chemistry of Chinese Medicine, The west NO.1 of Huangjiahu Road, wuhan, China, 430065; hxiao0430@hbtcm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, China; 465667892@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 455769451@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Gonghao", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; 2405642978@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuanyuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuhan, China; gl1224@163.com."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, ChinaWuhan, China, 430065; yukun_hbtcm@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Kun", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38598853", "10.1094/PDIS-11-23-2401-PDN"]}}]}
