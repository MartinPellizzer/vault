Although the effectiveness and remarkable safety of TCM have been documented after controlled clinical studies, there are several herbal and animal parts that are toxic or difficult to identify. DNA polymorphism-based assays have recently been developed for the identification of herbal medicines. In this approach, small amounts of DNA are amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and the reactions products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, sequencing, or hybridization with species-specific probes. With the DNA based identification of TCM materials as an example, chip-based analytical micro devices were developed with the goal of fabricating an integrated device that will enable sample preparation, amplification, and analysis on a single microchip-based device (\"lab-on-a-chip\"). The application of a silicon-based polymerase chain reaction microreactor and a DNA microarray for the DNA sequence-based identification of toxic medicinal plants is reported here."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, SAR, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Carles", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moganti", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lenigk", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsim", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ip", "ForeName": "N Y", "Initials": "NY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hsing", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sucher", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Fresenius J Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9114077", "ISSNLinking": "0937-0633"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z4152N8IUI", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microchemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11678190", "10.1007/s002160100964"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
