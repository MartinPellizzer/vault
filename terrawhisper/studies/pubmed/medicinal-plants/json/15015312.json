Seventy-two rats, including animals with TNBS-induced colitis, were treated with saline, TMP-1 (100, 200, 400 mg.kg-1) and DX. White blood cells were counted on the fifth day and the rats were killed by ether on the sixth day. SOD activity in serum, MPO and SOD activity of colonic tissue were measured.", "The remarkable effects of TMP-1 at dosage of 200, 400 mg.kg-1 on TNBS-induced colitis were observed. The ulcerative area was diminished and weight of colon was reduced. White blood cell population was reduced, SOD activity in serum and SOD activity of colon tissue were remarkably increased, and, MPO activity of colonic tissue was reduced.", "TMP-1 has significant effects on TNBS-induced colitis in rats with lower side effects, which suggests the effective component of rhubarb on colitis perhaps is TMP. The mechanism of the actions of TMP may relate to its antiflammation, antioxidation and immunoloregulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710032, Shanxi, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Qi-bing", "Initials": "QB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Si-yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Feng-hua", "Initials": "FH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Yin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jia-yun", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Jing-ru", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-peng", "Initials": "ZP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8T3HQG2ZC4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colitis, Ulcerative"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15015312"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
