After a 72 h culture, the cell number was significantly increased by AFE at 1, 5 and 10 micrograms/ml. An increase in the cell number by 5 micrograms/ml AFE observed after a 72 or 96 h treatment. The incorporations of both [3H]thymidine and [14C]leucine by the growing cells were significantly increased by 5 micrograms/ml AFE after a 72 h treatment. In addition, the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by either growing or confluent cells was significantly increased by 50 micrograms/ml AFE after a 72 h treatment. The stimulatory activity of AFE was recognized in the low-molecular-weight fraction (molecular weight less than or equal to 10000 dalton). These results clearly indicated that AFE contained some low-molecular-weight component(s) which stimulates the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kaji", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kaga", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miezi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ejiri", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakuragawa", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2337970", "10.1248/cpb.38.538"]}}]}
