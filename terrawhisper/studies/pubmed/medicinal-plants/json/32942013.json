A large number of synthetic drugs are available for the treatment of different types of cancer; however, a major problem associated with these drugs is its toxicity towards the normal cells. To overcome these problems, researchers explore plants derived phytochemicals because of their pleiotropic action and least toxicity towards the normal cells. Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone found extensively in citrus fruits and has shown potent anti-cancer activity in different types of cancer cells. Hence, this review examines the anti-cancer activity of tangeretin via different molecular targets/pathways. Tangeretin induces apoptosis via intrinsic as well as extrinsic pathways and arrest the cell cycle. It also suppresses cell proliferation by modulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Notch, and MAPK signalling pathways. Besides, it induces autophagic cell death, suppresses migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Further, the role of tangeretin in multi-drug resistance and combination therapy, different biological sources of tangeretin, its derivatives, and pharmacokinetics profile and toxicity studies are also discussed. Towards the end, the challenges associated with tangeretin usage as potential anti-cancer phytochemicals have also been discussed. Tangeretin, like a pandora's box, needs to be explored further, and more research is warranted to improve its usefulness for better human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
