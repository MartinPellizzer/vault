The structures of these compounds were determined through spectroscopic analysis and ECD calculations. Olivierisecosides NP (1-3) were identified as aromatic conjugated seco-iridoid glucosides, among them olivierisecoside N was representing a particularly rare subtype known as the morroniside seco-iridoids. The compounds 2, 3, 5, and 6 exhibited significant inhibition of COX-2 expression, particularly compound 5 which demonstrated the most pronounced inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 23.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51\u00a0\u03bcM.
