KY88 LIVER LIVO (KY88) is a blend of such compound. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of KY88 on the production of cytokines by lymphocytes in vitro.", "Seventy Sprague Dawley rats were used of which 40 were orally fed with 4 mg purified KY88 for 35 d. Normal human lymphocytes were isolated and cultured in standard conditions. The culture medium was collected at zero and 72 h after the KY88 treatment. The cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma, were measured by ELISA kits.", "TNF-alpha levels in the supernatant of cultured human lymphocytes significantly increased after the treatment of PHA and KY88. The mean levels were (855+/-251), (399+/-145), and (176+/-49) ng/L after the treatment with KY88 at the concentrations of 10, 1 and 0.1 g/mL respectively. However, the level in the control group without specific treatment was only (68+/-4) ng/L. The difference between KY88 10 g/mL and control groups was significant (P<0.05). All other cytokines did not show significant variations between KY88 and the control groups. KY88 may regulate the immune function through the induction of TNF-alpha expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, The University of Hong Kong, China. lwcchow@hkucc.hku.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chow", "ForeName": "Wing Cheong Louis", "Initials": "WC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loo", "ForeName": "Tjing Yung", "Initials": "TY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sham", "ForeName": "Shun Tong Jonathan", "Initials": "ST"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83869-56-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bupleurum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12546721"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
