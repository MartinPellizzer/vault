One of the most promising approaches is to inhibit intestinal alpha glucosidases. Based on our previous studies, four pyrimidine-fused heterocycles (PFH) were selected as they revealed satisfactory inhibitory action against mammalian \u03b1-glucosidase. The interaction of these compounds with both active domains of human maltase-glucoamylase (MGAM) and their effect on human Caco-2 cell line were investigated. The docking assessments suggested that binding properties of these ligands were almost similar to that of acarbose by establishing hydrogen bonds especially with Tyr1251 and Arg526 in both C-terminal and N-terminal MGAM, respectively. Also, these compounds indicated a stronger affinity for C-terminal of MGAM. L2 and L4 made tightly complexes with both terminals of MGAM which in turn revealed the importance of introducing pyrimidine scaffold and its hinge compartment. The results of molecular dynamics simulation analyses confirmed the docking data and showed deep penetration of L2 and L4 into the active site of MGAM. Based on cell cytotoxicity assessments, no significant cell death induction was observed. Hence, these functional MGAM inhibitors might be considered as new potential therapeutic compounds in treatment of diabetes and its complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
