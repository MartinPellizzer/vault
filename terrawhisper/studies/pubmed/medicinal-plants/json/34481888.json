Various bleeding control techniques have been emerged to augment hemostasis, which still has several limitations and drawbacks. In this study, epinephrine-entrapped chitosan nanoparticles were electrosprayed on a base pad and covered by a gelatin nanofiber layer (E-CS-Gl. Physico-chemical characteristics, hemocompatibility, cytotoxicity, and blood coagulation tests were studied in-vitro, and blood coagulation and hemostasis potential tests were performed in-vivo. The in-vitro results showed that the prepared nano-biomaterial is cytocompatible against HuGu cells. Also, hemocompatibility studies showed that PT and aPTT times did not change in comparison with the controls. Further blood coagulation study indicated that E-CS-Gl provides an ultimate interface to induce red blood cell absorption and aggregation, resulting in augmented blood coagulation. E-CS-Gl also caused rapid clotting in rat models of ruptured femoral artery and liver compared to controls. Findings exhibited that E-CS-Gl is a safe and effective hemostatic agent and provides a new approach for fast and safe hemorrhage control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
