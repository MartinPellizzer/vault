After that, they were evaluated for melanin synthesis in murine B16 cells and inhibitory effect on the growth of CA (Candida albicans), EC (Escherichia coli), SA (Staphylococcus aureus). It was found that eleven compounds (6b-f, 6j-o) showed a better activity on melanin synthesis than positive control (8-MOP). Among them, compounds 6d (242%) and 6f (390%), with nearly 1.6 and 2.6-fold potency compared with 8-MOP (149%) respectively, were recognized as the most promising candidate hits for further pharmacological study of anti-vitiligo. Seven halogen substituted compounds exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against CA. It is interesting that 6e-f and 6l-m, which had two halogens on the benzene showed a comparable activity with Amphotericin B against CA. The evaluation of melanin synthesis in B16 cells and inhibitory effect on bacteria of above structurally diverse derivatives had also led to an outline of structure-activity relationship."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
