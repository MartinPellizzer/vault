Some metabolites of plants and microorganisms possess properties that would make them effective treatments against bacterial infection, inflammation, cancer, and an array of other medical conditions. In addition, natural compounds offer therapeutic approaches with lower toxicity compared to most synthetic analogues. However, it is challenging to identify and isolate potential drug candidates without specific information about structural specificity and limited knowledge of any specific physiological pathways in which they are involved. To solve this problem and find a way to efficiently utilize natural sources for the screening of compounds candidates, technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics techniques, and molecular analysis systems, should be adapted for screening many chemical compounds. Molecular techniques capable of performing analysis of large datasets, such as whole-genome sequencing and cellular protein expression profile, have become essential tools in drug discovery. OMICs, as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, are often used in targeted drug discovery, isolation, and characterization. This review summarizes technologies that are effective in natural source drug discovery and aid in a more precisely targeted pharmaceutical approach, including RNA interference or CRISPR technology. We strongly suggest that a multidisciplinary effort utilizing novel molecular tools to identify and isolate active compounds applicable for future drug discovery and production must be enhanced with all the available computational tools."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList":
