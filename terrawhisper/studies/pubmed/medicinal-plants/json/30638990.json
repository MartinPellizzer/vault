Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates autophagy, which is regarded as the key cause of the activation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC). In this study, the effects of probucol on HSC activation and autophagy in\u00a0vitro and vivo and the role of FXR in this progress were investigated. Results showed that probucol ameliorated hepatic fibrosis and autophagy, and increased the expression of FXR in liver in a mouse model of fibrosis induced by CCl<sub>4</sub>. And probucol could alleviate lipopolysaccharide-induced autophagy and HSC activation in\u00a0vitro. In addition, probucol increased FXR expression, and the Z-guggulsterone, an antagonist of FXR, could block the effects of probucol on HSC activation and autophagy. Additionally, agonists of FXR could suppress LPS-induced autophagy and activation. These results suggest that probucol could ameliorate hepatic fibrosis, and inhibit HSC autophagy and activation, and these effects are associated with FXR."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
