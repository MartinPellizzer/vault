In recent studies, Nanoscience and nanotechnology are blazing fields for researchers; for researchers; of late there has been a prodigious excitement in the field of nanopharmacology to study silver nanoparticle (SNP) synthesis using natural products. Biological methods have been used to synthesize SNPs using medicinally active plants having an antidiabetic role, and this made us to assess the biologically synthesized SNPs from the seed extract of <i>Psoralea corylifolia</i> using 1 mM silver nitrate solution. The synthesized herbal-mediated SNPs (HMSNPs) were subjected to various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and differential light scattering (DLS), respectively. In the current study the HMSNPs were tested to observe the <i>in vitro</i> antidiabetic activity and possible toxic effects in healthy female albino mice by following OECD guidelines-425. Huge data from biochemical, cellular, mouse, and chemical inhibitor studies have recognized protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as a major negative regulator of insulin signaling. In addition, corroboration suggests that insulin action can be enhanced by the inhibition of PTP1B. Keeping in view of the above fact, the PTP1B assay was done to determine the PTP1 B inhibitory effect of HMSNPs. It can be concluded that medicinal plants can be a good source for the synthe sis of HMSNPs. This study can be used for the development of valuable nanomedicines to treat various ailments, and it also highlights the safety and biocompatibility of SNPs within a biological cell; <i>in vivo</i> parameters need to be considered for further discoveries.", "In present research, acute oral toxicity studies and <i>in vitro</i> anti diabetic activity of Herbal mediated silver nanoparticles (HMSNPs) has been investigated. Characterization techniques employed to determine the Crystallanity, size, shape and elemental composition of HMSNPs. The results obtained from acute oral toxicity studies and histopathological studies showed that the synthesized HMSNPs were non-toxic and safe. and also had good <i>in vitro</i> anti diabetic activity. The results would provide certain references to screen out more pharmacological activities of silver nanoparticles using green biosynthesis methods. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> HMSNPs: Herbal mediated silver nanoparticles, XRD: X-ray diffraction, EDX: Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, TEM: Transmission electron microscope, PTP1B: Protein tyrosine phosphotase 1B, OECD: Organization for economic cooperation and development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Science and Technology, JNT University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Shanker", "ForeName": "Kalakotla", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Science and Technology, JNT University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Mohan", "ForeName": "Gottumukkala Krishna", "Initials": "GK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Pullareddy Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medak, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Md Ashwaq", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Nanoscience and Technology, Institute of Science and Technology, JNT University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Jayarambabu", "ForeName": "Naradala", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Science and Technology, JNT University Hyderabad, Kukatpally, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Pravallika", "ForeName": "Poka Lakshmi", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dewanjee S, Das AK, Sahu R, Gangopadhyay M.
