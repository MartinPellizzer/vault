It is also present in different pathophysiologies related to several etiological agents. The aim of this study is to investigate the antidiarrheal effect of \u03b1 -Terpineol (\u03b1-TPN) in different diarrhea models in rodents. The antidiarrheal effect of \u03b1-TPN in the treatment of acute diarrhea and enteropooling induced by castor oil or PGE<sub>2</sub> in Swiss mice pretreated orally with saline (NaCl 0.9%), Loperamide (5\u2009mg/kg) and \u03b1-TPN (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50\u2009mg/kg) was analyzed. Additionally, parameters of severity, total weight of faeces and post-treatment for 4\u2009h were evaluated. Modulation of the opioid and cholinergic pathways was performed and intestinal transit model using activated charcoal as marker was also used. The effect of \u03b1-TPN on secretory diarrhea was investigated using the model of fluid secretion in intestinal loops isolated from cholera toxin-treated mice. \u03b1-TPN showed antidiarrheal effect (*p\u2009<\u20090.05), reducing the total stool amount (*55%, *48%, *44%, *24%) and diarrheal (*47%, *66%; *56%, 10%) respectively for the doses tested. All doses investigated in the enteropooling test presented significant changes (*46%, *78%, *66%, *41% respectively) in relation to the control. \u03b1-TPN through the muscarinic pathway reduced the gastrointestinal transit (*31%), besides inhibiting PGE<sub>2</sub>-induced diarrhea (*39%). \u03b1-TPN also reduced fluid formation and loss of Cl<sup>-</sup> ions, by interacting directly with GM1 receptors and cholera toxin, thus increasing the uptake of intestinal fluids. The results suggest an anti-diarrheal activity of \u03b1-TPN due to its anticholinergic action, ability to block PGE<sub>2</sub> and GM1 receptors and interaction with cholera toxin in secretory diarrhea, making it a promising candidate drug for the treatment of diarrheal diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 The Authors.
