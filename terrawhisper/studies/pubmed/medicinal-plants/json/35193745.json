Besides, these compounds have been associated with several health benefits in humans. Several exogenous and endogenous cues, for example, light, temperature, nutrient status, and phytohormones have been reported as modulators of biosynthesis and accumulation of flavonoids. Thus, multiple hormones and stress-related signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of gene expression associated with this pathway. The transcriptional regulators belonging to the MYB and bHLH family transcription factors are well documented as the direct regulators of the structural genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis. Recent studies also suggest that some of these factors are regulated by molecular components involved in stress and hormone signaling pathways. Adapter proteins for transcriptional activation or repression via recruitment of co-activators and co-repressors, respectively, E2 ubiquitin ligases, miRNA processing complex, and DNA methylation/demethylation factors have been recently discovered in various plants to play key roles in fine-tuning flavonoids synthesis. In the present review, we aim to provide comprehensive information about the role of different factors in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. Besides, we describe the potential upstream regulators involved in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis within the context of available information. To sum up, the present review furnishes an updated account of signal transduction pathways modulating the biosynthesis of flavonoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
