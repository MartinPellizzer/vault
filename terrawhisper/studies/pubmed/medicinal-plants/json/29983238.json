The levels of IL-4, IgE, PLA<sub>2</sub>, and TP significantly reduced in groups treated with all concentrations of RA compared to asthma group (P<0.001 for all cases). IFN-\u03b3 was significantly decreased in groups treated with two lower concentrations of RA but IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio was increased in groups treated with two higher concentrations of RA compared to asthma group (P<0.05 to P<0.001). Treatment with all doses of RA led to significant improvement in pathological scores in asthmatic animals (P<0.05 to P<0.001). Most measured parameters were also significantly improved in dexamethasone-treated animals (P<0.01 to P<0.001) but IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 ratio and the scores of interstitial fibrosis, bleeding and epithelial damage did not change in this group.", "The results indicated a preventive effect for RA on immunological and inflammatory mediators as well as lung pathological changes in asthmatic rats which were comparable or even more potent than that of dexamethasone."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 SEICAP.
