Since long-term use of chemical agents is not recommended, an alternative option would be medicinal plants for disinfection of the oral cavity.", "The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of <i>thymus vulgaris</i> (T. vulgaris) essential oil to decrease the count of <i>candida albicans</i> (C. albicans) accumulated on removal orthodontic appliances.", "In this 2-arm parallel controlled clinical trial, forty-four patients whose removable orthodontic appliances were contaminated with C. albicans were randomly divided into two groups by electronic random sampling. In the first group, T. vulgaris essential oil spray and in the second group, 0.2% chlorhexidine (CHX) spray was applied to the appliances. Thereafter, the C. albicans colony count was measured at baseline (T0) and at 2 (T1) and 5 (T2) days after the intervention. Microbial samples were collected by a sterile swab from 3 spots on the internal surface of orthodontic appliances. The Friedman test was used for within-group comparisons and the Mann Whitney test was employed to compare the efficacy of T. vulgaris essential oil with CHX.", "The results of this study revealed that continuous use of 2%T. vulgaris essential oil or 0.2% CHX significantly decreased the colony count of C. albicans on removable orthodontic appliances; Howevere, no significant difference was noted in the efficacy of 2% T. vulgaris essential oil and 0.2% CHX in decreasing the C. albicans colony count.", "T. vulgaris essential oil and CHX have favorable antimicrobial activity against C. albicans. Moreover, 2% T. vulgaris essential oil can be considered as an alternative to 0.2% CHX to eliminate fungal contamination of orthodontic appliances."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 Journal of Dentistry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Orthodontic, School of Dentistry, Shiraz Branch, Azad University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naseri", "ForeName": "Navid", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dentist, School of Dentistry, Shiraz Branch, Azad University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kalantari Khandani", "ForeName": "Arefe", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Orthodontic, School of Dentistry, Shiraz Branch, Azad University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baherimoghadam", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PhD Student, Dept. of Drug and Food Control, School of Pharmacy, Kerman University of Medical Science, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kalantari Khandani", "ForeName": "Azade", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral and Dental Disease Research Center, School of Dentistry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamedani", "ForeName": "Shahram", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nouripour-Sisakht", "ForeName": "Sadegh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Natural Resources and Environmental Engineering, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safaeian", "ForeName": "Roja", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "J Dent (Shiraz)", "NlmUniqueID": "101615440", "ISSNLinking": "2345-6418"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Littlewood SJ, Tait AG, Mandall NA, Lewis DH.
