The produced EPS consisted of two different heteropolysaccharides and two proteoglycans. The food intake of the diabetic control rats (STZ) was increased by 28.1%, whereas body weight gain was reduced by 44.1% as compared to the nondiabetic animals (NC). The plasma glucose level in the EPS-fed rats (EPS) was substantially reduced by 52.3% as compared to the diabetic rats (STZ), which is the highest hypoglycemic effect among mushroom-derived materials documented in literature. The activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and asparate aminotransferase (AST) were significantly decreased by administration of P. baumii EPS, thereby exhibiting a remedial role in liver function. The significant increase in weights of liver, spleen, and kidney was observed in diabetic groups (both STZ and EPS) compared to NC. The results suggest that orally administrated P. baumii EPS exhibited considerable hypoglycemic effect in STZ-induced diabetic rats and that these EPS may be useful for the management of diabetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Daegu University, Kyungsan, Kyungbuk 712-714, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Hye-Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sang-Woo", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Jong-Min", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joo", "ForeName": "Ji-Hoon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Oh", "Initials": "HO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Mi", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Jong-Won", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15850599", "10.1016/j.lfs.2004.12.019", "S0024-3205(05)00093-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
