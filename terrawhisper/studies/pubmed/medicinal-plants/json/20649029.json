Some natural compounds from Chinese herbs, which were shown to have the property as that of receptor agonist, might provide a rich source in search of new candidates for therapeutic use. For exploring this possibility, we developed a cell-based high throughput (HTS) D5 receptor assay to screen the herb-based natural compound library established in our centre. The D5 receptor plasmid (hD5R/pcDNA3.1) and reporter gene plasmid (4 x CRE/TK/Luci/pGL3) were co-transfected into HEK293 cell line. After G418 being selected, the monoclonal cell lines bearing hD5R and the reporter gene were established and used for agonist screening. To optimize the assay condition, the effects of some factors such as cell number per well, incubation time, and the doses of SKF38393 (a potent selective partial D1-like agonist) were examined by using forskolin, a positive compound for cAMP response element. The best condition for this HTS assay included: the cell number at 5 x 10(4)/mL, the dose of forskolin at 5-20 micromol/L, the dose of SKF38393 at 100 nmol/L-100 micromol/L, and the agonist incubation time at 6 -8 h. Thereafter, water extracts from more than 200 Chinese herbs in our library were screened and three of these water extracts showed positive activity, with higher or similar activity as SKF38393. In conclusion, we have established a cell-based HTS assay for D5 receptor agonist screening, and by use of this HTS assay, 3 Chinese herbs maybe contain components exhibiting D5 receptor agonist property. This work provides an alternative vision of how to use herb medicines and a way to develop potential drugs for treatment of neurological disorders."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medical Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing, 400067, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Xiaohong", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Zhongyi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xuxu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lixia", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Yi Xue Gong Cheng Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9426398", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5515"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "137750-35-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Dopamine D5"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Screening Assays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Dopamine D5"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20649029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
