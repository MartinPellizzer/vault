This plant is often contaminated by cadmium (Cd) and render health risk to human consumers. Understanding distribution of Cd and its chemical forms is important to evaluate accumulation of the metal and its detoxification mechanisms in this plant. Since few studies have focused on this aspect, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to spatially locate Cd in rhizome cross-sections, and ICP-MS to analyze the Cd subcellular distribution and the chemical forms of Cd in different tissues. Rhizome bioimaging results showed that Cd was distributed predominantly within the periderm, cortex, pith, and root trace vascular bundle. The LA-ICP-MS results suggested that Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels might be a pathway for Cd entry into the plant. Subcellular distribution data indicated that most of Cd was associated with the cell wall (41.8-77.1%) and the soluble fraction (14.4-52.7%) in all tissues. Analysis of chemical forms revealed that majority Cd existed in less mobile and less toxic forms in all tissues, and P could convert to insoluble phosphate with Cd to moderate Cd toxicity. The new understanding of Cd accumulation and detoxification might provide novel strategies for reducing the levels of Cd in C. chinensis Franch., thereby mitigating its potential transfer to humans and providing a theoretical basis for evaluating the Cd status in other medicinal plants. Further, our findings might provide a basis for establishing a reasonable Cd limit level of traditional Chinese medicinal materials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
