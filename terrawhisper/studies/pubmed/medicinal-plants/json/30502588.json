Vicenin-2, a bioflavonoid which are isolated from several medicinal plants. The present study was demonstrated the role of vicenin-2 on UVB linked oxidative stress and photoaging signaling in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). In this study, UVB-irradiation (100\u202fmJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) significantly elevated the intracellular ROS levels, lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, depletion of antioxidants resulted in apoptotic HDF cells. Interestingly, HDF cells were administrated with vicenin-2, 1\u202fh before UVB-irradiation prevents ROS generation, TBARS, apoptotic changes and DNA damage in HDF. MAPKs and MMP signaling are implicated in oxidative stress and photoaging; these signaling events are considered as photoaging and differentiation. We found that Vicenin-2 prevents over expression of MAPKs (p-ERK1, p-JNK & p-p38), AP-1 and MMPs (MMP-2, 9 & 12) in during the exposure of UVB in HDF cells. These findings conclude that vicenin-2 could be a potential bioactive ingredient to absorb UV photons and protects the dermal cells from the UVB associated oxidative stress and photoaging signaling due to sunscreen properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
