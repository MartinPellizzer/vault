The references have been collected from the 1970s to the present. \"Scutellarein\" is the most meaningful keyword to search for publications, in which it was used alone or in combination with other keywords.", "SCT as a hydrophobic flavonoid can be found in various medicinal plants of the families Lamiaceae, Compositae, and Verbenaceae. Flavone SCT has drawn much interest due to its wide pharmacological effects, such as anticancer, anti-inflammation, antioxidant, antiobesity, and vasorelaxant. The SCT treatments also possessed a lot of positive results in the neuron, liver, heart, lung, kidney, bone, and skin protective experiments, and human sperm function enhancement. Its underlying mechanism of action may relate to the apoptotic program and cytokine inhibition by regulating a panel of the signaling pathway, e.g., NF-\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa B)/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), I\u03baBa (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells inhibitors alpha)/NF-\u03baB, TRAF2 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2)/NF-\u03baB, and PTEN (phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10)/Akt (protein kinase B)/NF-\u03baB. In addition, the metabolic actions and synthetic derivative promotions of SCT were mostly based on the substitution of hydroxyl groups. Collectively, the studies that aim to highlight the role of scutellarein in preclinical and clinical treatments are urgently needed. More and more experiments to improve its bioavailability are expected."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
