This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Citrus aurantium vaginal cream on vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.", "This single-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted on 30 postmenopausal women who were referred to the Gynecology Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital in the city of Noor, Iran, from June to November 2020. Citrus aurantium vaginal cream was administered to women diagnosed with vaginal atrophy (based on subjective symptoms of atrophy, descriptive evaluation of the vagina, vaginal pH measurement, and degree of vaginal maturation determined by vaginal smear) every night in the first two weeks and every other night for the second two weeks. Data were collected using the scale of subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy; descriptive evaluation checklist of vaginal mucosa; laboratory results registration form (vaginal maturation index, vaginal maturation value, and vaginal pH) before the intervention and two and four weeks after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 24) through the analysis of variance with repeated measurements, and LSD post-hoc test. A P value less than 0.05 (P<0.05) was considered statistically significant.", "Citrus aurantium vaginal cream improved subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy (P<0.001), reduced the score of descriptive evaluation of vaginal mucosa (P<0.001), decreased vaginal pH (P<0.001), and increased vaginal maturity (P<0.001).", "The results showed that citrus aurantium vaginal cream could improve the symptoms of vaginal atrophy without causing serious complications. However, further studies with a control group are suggested to confirm the findings of this study.<b>Trial Registration Number:</b> IRCT20200215046494N."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 International Journal of Community Based Nursing and Midwifery."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Noor, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgharpoor", "ForeName": "Homeira", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, School of Medicine, Social Development & Health Promotion Research Center, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadizadeh-Talasaz", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, School of Medicine, Reproductive Health and Population Research Center, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmani", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Imam Ali Hospital, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmati", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Int J Community Based Nurs Midwifery", "NlmUniqueID": "101615484", "ISSNLinking": "2322-2476"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vaginal Creams, Foams, and Jellies"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vaginal Creams, Foams, and Jellies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postmenopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Vaginal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Atrophy"}], "CoiStatement": "None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Nappi RE, Kotek M, Bre\u0161t\u2019ansk\u00fd A, et al.
