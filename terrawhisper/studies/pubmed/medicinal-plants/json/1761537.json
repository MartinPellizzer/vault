WBAI is a dimer with two binding sites. The titration calorimetry yielded single-site binding constants ranging from 0.56 +/- 0.14 x 10(3) M-1 for Gal at 323.15 K to 7.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(3) M-1 for GalNAc at 298.15 K and binding enthalpies ranging from -28.0 +/- 2.0 kJ mol-1 for GalNAc at 298.15 K to -14.3 +/- 0.1 kJ mol-1 for methyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside at 322.65 K. The denaturation transition consisted of two overlapping peaks over the pH range 5.6-7.4. Fits of the differential scanning calorimetry data to a two-state transition model showed that the low temperature transition (341.6 +/- 0.4 K at pH 7.4) consisted of two domains unfolding as a single entity while the higher temperature transition (347.8 +/- 0.6 K at pH 7.4) is of the remaining WBAI dimer unfolding into two monomers. Both transitions shift to higher temperatures and higher calorimetric enthalpies with increase in added ligand concentration at pH 7.4. Analysis of the temperature increase as a function of added ligand concentration suggests that one ligand binds to the two domains unfolding at 341.6 +/- 0.6 K and one ligand binds to the domain unfolding at 347.8 +/- 0.6 K."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Rockville, Maryland 20850."}], "LastName": "Schwarz", "ForeName": "F P", "Initials": "FP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Puri", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Surolia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "winged bean lectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X2RN3Q8DNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1761537", "S0021-9258(18)54235-6"]}}]}
