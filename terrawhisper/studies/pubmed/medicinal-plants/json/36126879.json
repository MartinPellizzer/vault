Although dozens of LAC genes have been identified in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (a model medicinal plant), most have not been functionally characterized. Here, we explored the expression patterns and the functionality of SmLAC25 in S. miltiorrhiza. SmLAC25 has a higher expression level in roots and responds to methyl jasmonate, auxin, abscisic acid, and gibberellin stimuli. The SmLAC25 protein is localized in the cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Recombinant SmLAC25 protein could oxidize coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, two monomers of G-lignin and S-lignin. To investigate its function, we generated SmLAC25-overexpressed S. miltiorrhiza plantlets and hairy roots. The lignin content increased significantly in all SmLAC25-overexpressed plantlets and hairy roots, compared with the controls. However, the concentrations of rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B decreased significantly in all the SmLAC25-overexpressed lines. Further studies revealed that the transcription levels of some key enzyme genes in the lignin synthesis pathway (e.g., SmCCR and SmCOMT) were significantly improved in the SmLAC25-overexpressed lines, while the expression levels of multiple enzyme genes in the salvianolic acid biosynthesis pathway were inhibited. We speculated that the overexpression of SmLAC25 promoted the metabolic flux of lignin synthesis, which resulted in a decreased metabolic flux to the salvianolic acid biosynthesis pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
