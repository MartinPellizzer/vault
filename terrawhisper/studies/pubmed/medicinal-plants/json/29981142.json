As such, HR culture has an immense potential as a valuable platform to elucidate biosynthetic pathways and physiological processes, generate recombinant therapeutic proteins, assist molecular breeding, and enhance phytoremediation efforts. However, some plant species appear recalcitrant to the classical Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation techniques. Sonication-assisted Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (SAArT) is a highly effective method to deliver bacteria to target plant tissues that includes exposure of the explants to short periods of ultrasound in the presence of the bacteria.Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics is one of the most powerful and suitable platforms for identifying and obtaining structural information on a wide range of compounds with a high analytical precision. In terms of plant science, NMR metabolomics is used to determine the phytochemical variations of medicinal plants or commercial cultivars in certain environments and conditions, including biotic stress and plant biotic interaction, structural determination of natural products, quality control of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, and comparison of metabolite differences between plants and their respective in vitro cultures.In this chapter, we attempt to summarize our knowledge and expertise in induction of hairy roots from rare and recalcitrant plant species by SAArT technique and further methodology for extraction of secondary metabolites of moderate to high polarity and their identification by using NMR-based metabolomics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Group of Plant Cell Biotechnology and Metabolomics, The Stephan Angeloff Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 139 Ruski Blvd., 4000, Plovdiv, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Marchev", "ForeName": "Andrey S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Faculty of Biology, Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\", 8 Dragan Tsankov Blvd., Sofia, 1164, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Yordanova", "ForeName": "Zhenya P", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Group of Plant Cell Biotechnology and Metabolomics, The Stephan Angeloff Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 139 Ruski Blvd., 4000, Plovdiv, Bulgaria. milengeorgiev@gbg.bg."}], "LastName": "Georgiev", "ForeName": "Milen I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Methods Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214969", "ISSNLinking": "1064-3745"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29981142", "10.1007/978-1-4939-8594-4_32"]}}]}
