Persistent infection is the strongest risk factor for developing gastric complications leading to gastric cancer. The antibiotic resistance of current anti-H. pylori drugs lead to the search for novel candidates from medicinal plants. Traditionally, Corydalis yanhusuo (Y.H. Chou & Chun C.Hsu) W.T. Wang ex Z.Y. Su & C.Y. Wu (Papaveraceae) has been used for the treatment of digestive system diseases in China. So, it's essential to explore and confirm the anti-H. pylori activity of C. yanhusuo and characterize the pharmacologically active compounds.", "This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of C. yanhusuo as complementary or alternative modes of treatment against H. pylori-related diseases and ascertain the active substances of C. yanhusuo to develop non-toxic, natural, and inexpensive products.", "C. yanhusuo was subjected to solid-liquid extraction with water (WECY), ethanol EECY), and chloroform (CECY). The extracts were screened by agar diffusion assay, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the minimum bactericidal (MBC) for their in vitro antimicrobial activity, and by Berthelot reaction for urease inhibition. To assess the in vivo action, H. pylori-induced C57BL/6 mice were used to detect RUT biopsy, perform visual and histopathological analyses and evaluate IgG expression. Furthermore, we compared the anti-H. pylori activities of major alkaloids in CECY to identify the bioactive constituents.", "Among the three C. yanhusuo extracts, CECY showed the maximum in vitro antibacterial activity. Administration of CECY significantly inhibited the survival of H. pylori colonized in the gastric mucosa and alleviated gastric damage along with a reduction in the expression levels of IgG in H. pylori-infected mice. Berberine and dehydrocorydaline exhibited obvious anti-H. pylori activity with MIC of 25 and 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively.", "C. yanhusuo extracts showed anti-H. pylori activity in different degrees. Among them, CECY showed significant anti-H. pylori, gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo and in vitro. Dehydrocorydalmine, an active alkaloid compound isolated from C. yanhusuo, warranted further investigation for its potential anti-H. pylori activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
