It is known for high amounts of the valuable benzylisoquinoline alkaloid thebaine. The effects of induced polyploidy as well as the effect of methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation on the root production of thebaine and on the expression of five alkaloid biosynthesis related genes were studied. The in vitro tetraploidy induction caused a significant increased expression of norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) and salutaridinol (SAT), and a significant decreased expression of berberine bridge enzyme (BBE) in the leaves. In the root tissues, the BBE, NCS, and SAT showed an increased expression in tetraploid plants, while codeinone reductase (COR) showed a decreased expression. A similar alteration pattern was found in mixoploid plants when compared to their diploid counterparts. MeJA at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5\u00a0mM caused a remarkable increase in the thebaine content in the roots of treated plants, where the highest thebaine content was identified in plants elicited with 0.5\u00a0mM MeJA. Elicitation treatment caused a substantial increase in the expression of NCS and SAT in the leaves, while it had no major effect on BBE, codeine 3-O-demethylase (CODM) and COR. Expression analysis in the roots showed that MeJA caused a significant increase in the expression of only BBE and NCS, while expression of other studied genes remained unchanged. Our results may be exploited for improved thebaine production and the processing of Persian poppy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
