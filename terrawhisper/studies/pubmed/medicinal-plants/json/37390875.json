The study also emphasises the importance of conservation strategies to protect Saraca as a valuable resource for healthcare and suggests that more research is needed to systematically evaluate its phytochemical, pharmacological, and clinical properties, as well as to develop safety, pharmacology, and toxicology reports for traditional formulations.", "In light of this study, S. asoca could be considered an important source of potential herbal drugs.
