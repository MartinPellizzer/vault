Second, the rats were randomly divided into seven groups: model, XDP (90, 30, 10 mg x kg(-1)), XT (90, 30 mg x kg(-1)), lumbrukinase capsule. Then the effect of the drugs on thrombus and thrombosis was studied after the rats'thrombosis was induced by the electrical stimulation of common carotid artery. Third, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, model, XDP (80, 40 mg x kg(-1)), XT (40, 20 mg x kg(-1)).
