The H and E rabbits were fed a diet supplemented with cholesterol (0.5%) and coconut oil (10%) for 4 weeks. In addition, group E received 10 mL of the fruit juice/day during the last 2 weeks.

Total plasma cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, HDL and triglyceride levels were determined using commercial kits. MDA was quantified in native and oxidized LDL and in the arterial wall.", "After 4 weeks, the E group rabbits had a significantly lower weight, plasma cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride and aortic cholesterol content than group H(p < 0.05).
