By means of methanol extraction and gel filtration chromatography, two polymeric fractions were isolated from the cold water extract. A methanol-soluble polymeric fraction (CS1) was highly active in inhibiting CP complement activity exclusively, whereas a methanol-insoluble polymeric fraction (CI1) exhibited an inhibitory effect on both CP and AP complement activity. Preliminary chemical analysis of the anti-complementary fractions revealed the presence of structures of carbohydrate and of peptide nature in CS1 and CI1. The modulation of CP complement activity by CS1 was studied in more detail. Its inhibitory effect was proven to be based on complement consumption rather than on chelation of Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ or on stabilization of the target cells in the complement-assay. The purification of the aqueous extract prepared by refluxing, resulted in the isolation of a polymeric fraction with the same qualities as CS1. However, a fraction with properties similar to CI1 could not be isolated from this extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Simons", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hart", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Dijk", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "F C", "Initials": "FC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Silva", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Labadie", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2601357", "10.1016/0378-8741(89)90064-0", "0378-8741(89)90064-0"]}}]}
