Its roots and rhizomes are used as the traditional Chinese medicine Gan-Cao. However, little is known on medicinal potential and chemistry of the other parts of the plant. In this work, the biological activities and chemical components of the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of G. uralensis were investigated comparatively. The four parts exhibited different but noticeable biological activities. The chemicals in the four parts were globally characterized by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) on a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC system connected to a Q-Exactive quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer. By integrating molecular networking, compound spectral matching, MS2LDA-based substructure recognition, and reference standards comparison, a total of 1301 compounds were rapidly characterized. Three flavonoid C-glycosides were purified and their structures were identified by NMR spectroscopic analysis. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) further revealed 196 differential chemicals for the four parts. This work will promote the medicinal resource utilization of G. uralensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
