Nearly all parts of the plant especially needles are believed to possess medicinal and clinical values in traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurvedic, Unani or Homeopathic. They are used to heal numerous diseases, including afflictions of the skin, eyes, throats and ears. Various parts of the plant including needles are rich in biologically active compounds, such as thunbergol, 3-carene, cembrene, \u03b1-pinene, quercetin, xanthone, etc. The scientific data available for the biological potential of this plant and its constituents have been found to be scanty and also does not satisfy the basis of their age-old folklore and local uses. This review focuses on a detailed analysis of ethnopharmacognosical studies on the needles of different Pinus species growing naturally in northwestern region of Indian Himalayas including investigations and findings that have come up with a concrete view of the abilities of plant components for example phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and other constituents to treat oxidative, inflammatory and microbial responses. Careful evaluation of the data presented may be helpful for the researchers to discover and evaluate the specific chemical entities responsible for the traditional medicinal uses of P. roxburghii, P.wallichiana, P. merkusii, P.kesiya and P.thunbergii."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Lav", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Dixit", "ForeName": "Pooja", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Ravi P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Diversity, Systematics and Herbarium Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Shivaraman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering Division, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Praveen C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Saxena", "ForeName": "Gauri", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JPF3YI7O34", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-pinene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bicyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31424365", "10.2174/1389201020666190819153600", "CPB-EPUB-100322"]}}]}
