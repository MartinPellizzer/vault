These are usually collected in the countryside, boiled dry or fresh, and drunk after meals. The drinking of t\u00e9 is a social habit that encourages conversation in a relaxed atmosphere. T\u00e9s are also commonly used as digestifs and stomachics, and in some cases as laxatives, antidiarrhoeics, and to reduce the blood pressure. They are not used as stimulants. It appears that the habit of drinking Camellia sinensis afforded the cognitive context for drinking other infusions with no specific medicinal purpose. Some t\u00e9 species are very common in Spain (and their use is quite extended), others are endemic, and others still are allochthonous that now live in the wild. The majority of these species belong to the families Asteraceae and Lamiaceae. The most important and widely distributed are Jasonia glutinosa, Sideritis hyssopifolia, Lithospermum officinale, Chenopodium ambrosioides and Bidens aurea. Other remarkable but more locally used t\u00e9s include Cruciata glabra (only in the Pyrenees), Inula salicina and Mentha arvensis (in the Central Mountain Range of Madrid), and Potentilla caulescens (in Tarragona)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico (CSIC), Plaza de Murillo 2, E-28014 Madrid, Spain. mpardo@ma-rjb.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pardo de Santayana", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blanco", "ForeName": "Emilio", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morales", "ForeName": "Ram\u00f3n", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}], "NumberOfReferences": "97"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15763359", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.11.003", "S0378-8741(04)00561-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
