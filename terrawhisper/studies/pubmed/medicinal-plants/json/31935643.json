In this study, the pineapple and maize residues under different operations were monitored by batch biogas assays and 16S high-throughput sequencing to explore: 1) biomethane potential regarding different operations, 2) microbial communities in different treated reactors, and 3) significant factors determine microbial distribution. Results showed that the co-digestion had higher methanogenic abundance and biomethane production (~3300\u00a0mL<sub>n</sub>) versus mono-digestion under mesophilic condition. To the thermophilic condition, the co-digestion had less methanogenic abundance but more biomethane production (~5000\u00a0mL<sub>n</sub>). Statistical evidence uncovered that the Clostridiaceae and Thermoanaerobacteraceae dominated pathways linked closely with methanogenesis which may contribute the more biomethane production in the thermophilic condition. This study demonstrated the temperature regulations drove rare taxa as major contributors for biomethane production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
