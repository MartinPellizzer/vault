The normal mice received olive oil (0.2 ml/mouse) for five weeks. The CCl4 control mice, on the other hand, received CCl4 (0.05 ml/mouse) in olive oil for five weeks. The extract was administered at the dose of 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg for five weeks by gastric intubation in addition to CCl4 treatment. The CCl4 administration alone caused hepatocellular necrosis, severe anemia, leucopaenia, lymphocytopaenia, neutrophilia, eosinophilia and haemoglobinaemia along with the alterations of plasma albumin and globulin. The administration of plant extract (at 100 or 150 mg/kg) restored the CCl4-induced alterations of the haematological parameters to the normal level. The extract of T. portulacastrum elicited a marked protection against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by the several haematological parameters, related indices of formed elements, and different fractions of plasma protein. We also observed the dose-dependent antihepatotoxic effect of the extraction on these mice. The 150 mg/kg of extract was found to be more effective in normalizing the toxic effects of CCl4 on the above parameters of mice. These results suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of T. portulacastrum could be caused by its critical involvement in modulating several factors associated with erythropoiesis, and the boosting of general immunity of the host."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mandal", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karmakar", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandyopadhyay", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "prevention & control", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9875435", "10.1007/BF02975279"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
