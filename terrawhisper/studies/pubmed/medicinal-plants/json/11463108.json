Treatment with oral quinine sulfate (10 mg/kg every 8 hr) was substituted for i.v. quinine when the patient was able to take oral medicine. All patients were followed up in the hospital for 7 days; thereafter, they were treated as outpatients on Days 14, 21, and 28. Mortality rate, the main efficacy parameter, was 11.8% lower in the arteether treatment group than in the quinine group (15.7% versus 27.4%); however, the difference was not significant (P = 0.25). Means for fever clearance time, coma resolution time, and parasite clearance time were similar in the 2 treatment groups (42.2 +/- 34.9 hr; 34.8 +/- 18.8 hr, and 46.3 +/- 28.5 hr, respectively for arteether, versus 45.0 +/- 26.7 hr; 30.3 +/- 18.9 hr, and 40.7 +/- 18.9 hr, respectively, for quinine). At 28 days, the cure rates were 73.2% and 64.9% for the arteether and quinine treatment groups, respectively. Arteether is safe and therapeutically at least as effective as quinine for the treatment of cerebral malaria in children in Cameroon. Because of its ease of administration, arteether appears to be suited for use in the rural zones where monitoring facilities do not exist."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Study of Medicinal Plants/Medical Research Center, Yaounde, Cameroon, West Africa. roger.moyou@camnet.cm"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moyou-Somo", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tietche", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ondoa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kouemeni", "ForeName": "L E", "Initials": "LE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekoe", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mbonda", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nsangou", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jemea", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guemkam", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Trop Med Hyg", "NlmUniqueID": "0370507", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9637"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A7V27PHC7A", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XGL7GFB9YI", "NameOfSubstance": "artemotil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria, Cerebral"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria, Falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11463108", "10.4269/ajtmh.2001.64.229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
