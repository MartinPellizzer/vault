Since the concentration of \"endogenous digitalis\" was 7-19 fold higher in 2 patients, who had become uremic due to a malignant hypertension and since their serum levels fell 3-fold by hemodialysis, the hemofiltrate was used for partial purification of the substance. This was possible by hydrophobic chromatography on Amberlite XAD-2, octadecyl-coated silica gel, anion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on membrane-bound (Na+ + K+)-ATPase. The partially purified substance behaved like the material described by Cloix et al. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 131:1234-1240 and competed with digoxin for digoxin antibodies. Ascorbic acid isolated on the search for an inhibitor of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase from beef brain inhibited [3H]ouabain binding due to a decrease of the ouabain binding sites by a reduction of a group within the ATP binding site of the enzyme. Unsaturated fatty acids claimed to be \"endogenous digitalis (Tamura et al. [1985] J. Biol. Chem. 260:9672-9677)\" also lowered the capacity of the cardiac glycoside binding site but did not compete with ouabain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kuske", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moreth", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Renner", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wizemann", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schoner", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Klin Wochenschr", "NlmUniqueID": "2985205R", "ISSNLinking": "0023-2173"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrafiltration"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2439745"]}}]}
