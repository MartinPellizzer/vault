Therefore, we developed a simple and fast procedure to extract and simultaneously hydrolyze phytoestrogens and their conjugates from food items, and present a fast and selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for precise determinations of the most common dietary phytoestrogens genistein, biochanin-A, daidzein, formononetin, and coumestrol using flavone as internal standard. For the first time HPLC was applied to measure these phytoestrogens and their most abundant metabolites equol and O-desmethyl-angolensin from human urine. The proposed methodology has been evaluated for losses due to thermal degradation during extraction and hydrolysis and due to sample handling during the entire work-up including solid phase extraction, and values are given for inter- and intra-assay variability. We present isoflavonoid levels of most common peas and beans used in \"western\" and \"eastern\" diets and compare isoflavonoid and coumestrol levels of raw, canned, and cooked foods which can be used in future epidemiological studies. We also determined human urinary levels with our methodology comparing values before and after soybean intake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Carcinogenesis Program, Cancer Research Center of Hawaii, Honolulu 96813."}], "LastName": "Franke", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Custer", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cerna", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Narala", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proc Soc Exp Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7505892", "ISSNLinking": "0037-9727"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4',7-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydroisoflavone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "531-95-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Equol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V7NW98OB34", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumestrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chromans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coumestrol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7892289", "10.3181/00379727-208-43826"]}}]}
