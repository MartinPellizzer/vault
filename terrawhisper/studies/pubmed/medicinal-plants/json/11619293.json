The original book was kept at the Faculty of Literature, Tokyo University. In 1994, this book was first published as one of the Iwanami-Bunko Series. I studied the tales recorded in this book and found that twenty-seven of them were concerned with medical and pharmaceutial sciences. In these medical and pharmaceutical tales, there were several kinds, relating to such matters as spells to cure or prevent illness, curious sicknesses, episodes regarding the origin of remedies, medicinal plants and crude drugs, medical books, doctors and surgeons, persons who lived long, and so forth. It was difficult to explain about the spells which were thought effective to cure illness, but I could gain an understanding that Japanese people lived such lives in the old days."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamada", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Ishigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0165261", "ISSNLinking": "0549-3323"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History of Pharmacy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine in Literature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11619293"]}}]}
