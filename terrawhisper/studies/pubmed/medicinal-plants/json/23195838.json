Ten were active against at least one of the pathogenic and/or non-pathogenic bacteria and one against a non-pathogenic fungus in bioautographic TLC and agar diffusion tests. Cytotoxic/antitumor potential was found for one plant species with cell lines (KB, Caco-2) and for six with the brine shrimp assay. In the NF-\u03baB- and the HET-CAM-test used to test for anti-inflammatory potential, two respectively one plant extract showed noteworthy activity. Furthermore, a potentially immunomodulating activity was investigated by evaluating the influence of extracts in various in vitro assays using murine and human lymphoid cells. In addition to the reported biological activities of the eleven plant species, comparisons of the ethnobotanical data and strategies for the selection for further phytochemical investigations are discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 1998 Gustav Fischer Verlag.
