The bean pathogen, Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli, secretes a glycoenzyme, kievitone hydratase (EC 4.2.1.95), which catalyzes conversion of kievitone to a less toxic metabolite. Among F. solani strains, those that are highly virulent to P. vulgaris also produce kievitone hydratase constitutively, suggesting that the enzyme is a virulence factor. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified enzyme, the kievitone hydratase cDNA and gene (khs) were cloned. The identities of khs and the cDNA were confirmed by their expression in transgenic Neurospora crassa and Emericella nidulans. Based on the gene and cDNA sequences, khs is predicted to encode a preprotein of 350 amino acids, from which a 19 amino acid N-terminal transit peptide is removed during maturation and secretion. The predicted mass of the mature polypeptide, 37 kDa, contrasts with the 47 to 49 kDa size estimated by electrophoresis of purified enzyme, confirming that the enzyme is extensively glycosylated. The inferred polypeptide sequence has seven canonical sites for N-glycosylation. Southern blot-hybridization analysis of F. s. f. sp. phaseoli DNA indicates one khs locus and an additional locus with weak hybridization to the khs probe. Sequences related to khs were also detected in several isolates of F. solani and the related teleomorph, Nectria haematococca. However, strains of F. oxysporum known to exhibit inducible kievitone hydratase activity (but not pathogenic to bean) did not have detectable khs homology. Nevertheless, all isolates known to cause severe disease on bean possessed khs sequence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of Kentucky, Lexington 40546-0091, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "K R", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schardl", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["L39639"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydro-Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.2.1.95", "NameOfSubstance": "kievitone hydratase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytoalexins"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["khs"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungal Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydro-Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytoalexins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7655061", "10.1094/mpmi-8-0388"]}}]}
