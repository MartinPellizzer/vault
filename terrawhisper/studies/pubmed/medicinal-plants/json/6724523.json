This combination minimizes potentially harmful effects of proteinases and products of the secondary metabolism of a green plant during the early steps. The molecular mass is 260 000 Da with a subunit structure of alpha 2 beta 2 (alpha = 59 000, beta = 70 000 Da). Enzymatic activity was optimal with 20mM Mg2+ and 10mM KCl at pH 6.5 and pH 8.5, depending on the buffer substance. Kinetic measurements at low temperature and steady-state kinetics indicate that the esterification of tRNA or a step preceding it, but not the activation, are rate-determining at pH 7.65. The cognate tRNAPhe is exclusively aminoacylated at the 2'-OH group. tRNAs from Escherichia coli and bean chloroplasts are not aminoacylated. No immunological relationship of the plant enzyme to other phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases was revealed by immuno-diffusion and immunotitration with polyclonal antibodies raised against the enzymes from E. coli, yeast and hen liver. ATP analogs revealed a unique pattern of substrate properties with indication of conservation of ATP binding in the form of an ATP-Mg2+ complex in the anti-conformation with a coordination of the cation to the nitrogen in position 7 of the purine moiety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rauhut", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gabius", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cramer", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985060R", "ISSNLinking": "0018-4888"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 6.1.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylalanine-tRNA Ligase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acyl-tRNA Synthetases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylalanine-tRNA Ligase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6724523", "10.1515/bchm2.1984.365.1.289"]}}]}
