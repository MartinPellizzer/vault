The biological activities were evaluated by AChE/BChE inhibition and MAO-A/MAO-B inhibition. The results revealed that the tertiary amines and methylene chain length significantly affected the eeAChE inhibitory potency, in particular, compound TM-14 showed the best eeAChE inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.9\u202f\u03bcM, in addition, both kinetic analysis of AChE inhibition and docking study displayed that TM-14 could simultaneously bind to the catalytic active site and peripheral anionic site of AChE. Moreover, compound TM-14 was a selective metal chelator and could form 1:1 TM-14-Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex. The structure-active-relationship also indicated that the O-alkylamine fragment remarkably decreased hMAO-B inhibitory activity, compound TM-2 exhibited potent hMAO-B inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u03bcM), which was supported by the molecular docking study. More interestingly, compounds TM-14 and TM-2 could cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro. Therefore, the structure-active-relationship of 2-acetylphenol-donepezil hybrids could encourage the development of multifunction agents with selective AChE inhibition or selective MAO-B inhibition for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
