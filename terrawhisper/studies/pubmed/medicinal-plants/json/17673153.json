Therefore we have investigated the possibility of using an arabinogalactan polysaccharide, G1-4A, from the stem of Tinospora cordifolia, for protection against endotoxin induced sepsis. There was 100% protection against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced mortality in mice pretreated with G1-4A. To elucidate the mechanism of action, its effect on macrophages, the primary source of these pro-inflammatory molecules was evaluated. G1-4A was shown to bind to the murine macrophages leading to their activation and reciprocally inhibited binding of LPS to macrophages. Following treatment with G1-4A, there was a small increase in serum TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels. However, challenge with LPS elicited significantly reduced levels of TNF-alpha in G1-4A pretreated mice as compared to the controls while the level of soluble TNFR was enhanced. An increase in serum IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-gamma levels and decrease in that of IL-10 was observed following challenge with LPS in mice pretreated with G1-4A as compared to the controls. In addition, G1-4A also modulated the release of nitric oxide by murine macrophages. Similar phenomenon was observed in a human monocytic cell line, U937. Thus G1-4A appeared to induce tolerance against endotoxic shock by modulation of cytokines and nitric oxide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Biology and Health Sciences Division, Bio-Medical Group, Mumbai-400 085, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Desai", "ForeName": "Veena R", "Initials": "VR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramkrishnan", "ForeName": "Rupal", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chintalwar", "ForeName": "Gajanan J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sainis", "ForeName": "K B", "Initials": "KB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "100965259", "ISSNLinking": "1567-5769"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SL4SX1O487", "NameOfSubstance": "arabinogalactan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Galactans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Septic"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tinospora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "U937 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17673153", "10.1016/j.intimp.2007.06.004", "S1567-5769(07)00167-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
