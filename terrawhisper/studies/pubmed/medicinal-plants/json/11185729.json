Ginkgo biloba extract (300 mg/kg BW) was administered orally 2 days before and 8 days concurrently with gentamicin (80 mg/kg BW). Saline treated animals served as control. Estimations of urine creatinine, glucose, blood urea, serum creatinine, plasma and kidney tissue MDA were carried out after 8 days of gentamicin treatment. Kidneys were examined using histological techniques. Blood urea and serum creatinine were increased by 896% and 461% respectively, with gentamicin, compared to saline treated group. Creatinine clearance was significantly decreased with gentamicin. Ginkgo biloba extract protected rats from gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Changes in blood urea, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance induced by gentamicin were significantly prevented by Ginkgo biloba extract. There was a 177% and 374% rise in plasma and kidney tissue MDA with gentamicin, which were significantly reduced to normal with Ginkgo biloba extract. Histomorphology showed necrosis and desquamation of tubular epithelial cells in renal cortex with gentamicin, while it was normal and comparable to control with Ginkgo biloba extract. These data suggest that supplementation of Ginkgo biloba extract may be helpful to reduce gentamicin nephrotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Punjagutta, Hyderabad, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naidu", "ForeName": "M U", "Initials": "MU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shifow", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ratnakar", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gentamicins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Gentamicins"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11185729", "10.1016/s0944-7113(00)80003-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
