Much effort has been made recently by the plant science research community to address this imbalance. The responses of plants to environmental conditions can now be defined using a variety of imaging approaches. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a promising approach to measure traits using a wide range of wavebands simultaneously in 3D to capture information in lab, glasshouse, or field settings. HSI has been applied to define abiotic, biotic, and quality traits for optimisation of crop management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
