Schischk. The confusion regarding the species emerged centuries ago. Various medicinal plants from the family Umbelliferae have been documented under the name Fangfeng or other similar names in different areas of China. However, the efficacy and chemical profiles of these herbs can vary widely. In recent years, studies on medicinal material markets have revealed that \"ChoutaiFangfeng\" and \"ShiFangfeng\" are sold as Fangfeng. Previous studies on the differences among these herbs were not accurate; therefore, comprehensive authentication of these species is required. Investigation of the microscopic features of the transverse sections and powders of herbs is of great significance in identifying traditional Chinese medicine. This approach offers the advantages of easy operation and rapid results. In this study, microscopic observation of cross-sectional tissues and powders of the herbs was performed using common light microscopy and polarized light microscopy, respectively, to identify Fangfeng, ChoutaiFangfeng, and ShiFangfeng. We found that phloem, clefts, and other significant tissue characteristics can be used to distinguish Fangfeng herbs. The developed method can also be applied to distinguish counterfeits of Fangfeng. Moreover, the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of Fangfeng and its two adulterants were determined."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2344-7350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Furui", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Donghui", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Shouhe", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dongmei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaoqiu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yingni", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2018014", "Agency": "the Fourth Investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine resources in Liaoning Province of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018017", "Agency": "the Fourth Investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine resources in Liaoning Province of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019017", "Agency": "the Fourth Investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine resources in Liaoning Province of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019019", "Agency": "the Fourth Investigation of Traditional Chinese Medicine resources in Liaoning Province of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Polarization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chinese Pharmacopoeia Committee.
