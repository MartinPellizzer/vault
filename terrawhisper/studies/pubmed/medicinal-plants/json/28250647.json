Group 1 (negative control) received distilled water and normal diet only, Groups 2-6 received the extract (at 250 or 500 mg/kg body weight) and/or SA at 2.5 mg/kg body weight.", "There was statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05) increase in the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes and lipid peroxidation in the SA group as compared with the negative control and treated groups. Administration of the extract reduced the effects of SA on the above parameters. Activities of serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases did not show statistically significant effects; however, the histological analyses revealed periportal cellular infiltration by mononuclear cells, whereas the MELAD treated groups show mild cellular infiltration and mild portal congestion.", "MELAD protect against SA-induced toxicities in rats, and it may offer protection in circumstances of co-exposure and cases of arsenicosis.", "MELAD extract significantly reduce the lipid peroxidation induced by sodium arsenite in the liver of rats.MELAD did not show profound effects on the activities of serum alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotranferases.MELAD offered significant protection against sodium arsenite-induced genotoxicity in the micronuclei induction assay.In the circumstances of co-exposure to arsenic contamination, MELAD may protect against sodium arsenite-induced toxicities. <b>Abbreviations Used:</b> MELAD: Methanol extract of the leaves of <i>Adansonia digitata</i>, SA: Sodium arsenite, nMPCEs: Number of micronucleated polychromatic erythocytes; ALT: Alanine aminotranferase; AST: Aspartate aminotranferase, TBARS: Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBA: Thiobarbituric acid, MDA: malondialdehyde, Sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), IARC: International Agency for Research on Cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Molecular Biology Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adegoke", "ForeName": "Ayodeji Mathias", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Molecular Biology Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Gbadegesin", "ForeName": "Michael Adedapo", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Research and Molecular Biology Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Odunola", "ForeName": "Oyeronke Adunni", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Wijeweera JB, Gandolfi AJ, Parrish A, Lantz RC.
