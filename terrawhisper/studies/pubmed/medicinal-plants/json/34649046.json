Among them, ophiopogonols A-B are two unusual spirostanols with a rearranged A/B ring system (5/7/6/5/5/6 ring system) that have not previously been identified in plants. The chemical structures of all isolated steroidal glycosides were elucidated by comprehensive analysis through chemical methods, HRESIMS, and NMR spectroscopy. Further, putative biosynthetic pathways for ophiopogonols A-B were proposed. In addition, based on traditional applications of O. japonicus, cytotoxic effects of the isolates were evaluated using human large cell lung carcinoma cells (NCI-H460\u00a0cells). Sprengerinin C displayed a remarkable cytotoxic effect with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u03bcM by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase cycle arrest in the NCI-H460\u00a0cell line."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
