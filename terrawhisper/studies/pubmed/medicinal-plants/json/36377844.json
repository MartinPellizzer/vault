The present study aimed to investigate the effects of products obtained from the thermal oxidation process of sunflower oil on metabolic indices, and the secretion status of leptin and ghrelin in rats. In vivo studies were designed after determining the rate of formation of active aldehydes and peroxide value in sunflower oil following 300\u00b0C in a period of 30-240\u2009min. To this end, 36 rats in 6 separate groups were fed with 2\u00a0ml of normal saline, fresh sunflower oil, and heated oils at 30, 60, 120, and 240\u2009min for 45\u2009days. Finally, lipid profile changes and leptin/ghrelin secretion were examined, along with histological changes in the liver tissue. The results indicated a significant increase in serum LDL, VLDL and triglycerides, and a decrease in HDL, in the groups treated with heated oils. These changes were associated with a higher accumulation of triglycerides, active aldehydes, and histological changes in the hepatic tissue. Although the serum ghrelin level in the groups receiving heated oil did not change significantly compared to the fresh oil, the serum leptin level increased significantly in the groups receiving heated oil. According to our findings, increasing the time of sunflower oil heating enhanced the formation of active aldehydes, so that daily consumption of such oxidized oils might be associated with the occurrence of dyslipidemia, fatty liver and the development of leptin resistance. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Sunflower oil is highly prone to oxidative degradation during the frying process. Increasing time of sunflower oil heating enhanced the formation of active aldehydes. Daily consumption of oxidized oils might be associated with the occurrence of dyslipidemia, fatty liver and the development of leptin resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9072-8318"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nili-Ahmadabadi", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0134-4257"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Torabi", "ForeName": "Kiyana", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3957-2781"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Mojdeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5853-752X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, School of Medicine, Nutrition Health Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heshmati", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ghrelin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Leptin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunflower Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ghrelin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leptin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dyslipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Liver"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abuzaytoun, R., Budge, S., Hansen, L.
