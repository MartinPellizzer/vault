Diabetes was induced with single intravenous injection of alloxan monohydrate (150mg/kg). Glibenclamide and acarbose were used as standard drugs. The crude powder of Thymus serpyllum (500 mg/kg b.w) significantly reduced blood glucose level in both normal and diabetic rabbits. Various extracts of Thymus serpyllum were compared for their hypoglycemic activity in diabetic rabbits. Ether and aqueous extracts significantly reduced the blood glucose level with maximum effect (p<0.001) produced by aqueous extract, which was selected for further study. Aqueous extract significantly inhibited the rise in glucose level in oral glucose tolerance test. The extract showed synergistic effect with different doses of insulin; however serum insulin level of the diabetic rabbits was not significantly increased by the extract. HbA1c level was significantly (p<0.05) reduced whereas hemoglobin level was significantly increased in three months study. Phytochemical screening of the aqueous extract showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpinoids, reducing sugar and cardiac glycosides. It is concluded that the aqueous extract might be used alone or in combination with insulin to manage diabetes and its associated complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Alamgeer", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mushtaq", "ForeName": "Muhammad Naveed", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bashir", "ForeName": "Sajid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy GC University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Ikram", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Pharmacy, Punjab University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Karim", "ForeName": "Sabeha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, The University of Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nasir Hayat", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine, Sargodha Medical College, University of Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Haroonur", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycated Hemoglobin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SW5YHA5NG", "NameOfSubstance": "Alloxan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alloxan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycated Hemoglobin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27731800"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
