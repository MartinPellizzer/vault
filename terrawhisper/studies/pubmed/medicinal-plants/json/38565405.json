We randomly assigned the 63 patients to receive a placebo (arm A), or 1200 mg HL301 (arm B), or 1800 mg HL301 (arm C). Patients received weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin concurrently with intensity-modulated radiation therapy at 60 to 66 Gy in conventional fractionation. Durvalumab was administered as a maintenance treatment according to standard clinical practice. HL301 was administered orally, daily for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was incidence of grade \u22652 radiation pneumonitis at 24 weeks postchemoradiotherapy.", "The baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced. The drug was tolerable with a compliance rate of 86.6%, 86.2%, and 88.8% in arms A, B, and C, respectively (P = .874). None of the patients experienced severe drug-related adverse events. No significant difference in the rate of adverse events were observed between the treatment arms. The incidence of grade \u22652 radiation pneumonitis at 24 weeks postchemoradiotherapy was 37.5% (95% CI, 18.5%-61.4%), 55.6% (95% CI, 33.7%-75.4%), and 52.4% (95% CI, 32.4%-71.7%) in arms A, B, and C, respectively (P = .535).", "This is the first exploratory clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of HL301 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Safety and feasibility of HL301 were established but no signals of efficacy in reducing radiation pneumonitis was observed in this dose level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
