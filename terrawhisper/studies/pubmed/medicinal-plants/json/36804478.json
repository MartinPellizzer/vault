The structures of all the isolated compounds were determined from NMR, HRESIMS and X-ray diffraction spectroscopies. Additionally, a novel 3-step synthetic route was developed to synthesize ligusticumine C by substitution, thiolation and coupling, with an overall yield of 5.4%. The inhibitory activities of the isolated compounds against phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) were tested, of which, (3S)-butylphthalide, a characteristic component of L. striatum, showed a potent inhibitory effect on PI3K\u03b1 (IC<sub>50</sub>: 3.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
