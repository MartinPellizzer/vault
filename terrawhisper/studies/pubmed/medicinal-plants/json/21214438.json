Ten of the 19 showed significant antiviral activity and all but two displayed antibiotic activity. Extracts of three species, Adansonia digitata (the most potent), Conyza aegyptiaca and Palisota hirsuta , were active against all three test viruses (herpes simplex, Sindbis and poliovirus). The other seven, however, were more selective, showing activity against only one or two viruses. The antibiotic profiles varied considerably. The observation that each extract showed a distinctive permutation of target organisms suggests that different bioactive phytochemicals are present in each species. Only two of the extracts were devoid of bioactivity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Anani", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hudson", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "de Souza", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akpagana", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tower", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arnason", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gbeassor", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21214438", "10.1076/1388-0209(200001)3811-BFT040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
