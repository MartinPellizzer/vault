They are occasionally present in various unrelated plants for no apparent reason; no phytohormonal function has yet been identified. In certain cases, ecdysteroids are accumulated to high levels in leaves, roots or seeds. Some ecdysteroid-containing plants have been known as medicinal plants for centuries. One of them, Leuzea carthamoides Iljin (Asteraceae), growing in Central Asia, contains 0.4% ecdysteroid in dry roots and 2% in seeds. A pharmacological preparation from this plant, \"Ecdisten', is already available as a commercial preparation for its anabolic, tonic and other effects, for medical use (review). It remained problematic, however, whether ecdysteroids were truly responsible for these effects, because Leuzea contains a number of other biologically active compounds in addition to ecdysteroids. We extracted and purified ecdysteroids from the seeds of Leuzea. With 6 g of 96% 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), we made a large-scale feeding assay with Japanese quail to find out whether ecdysteroid alone could duplicate the anabolic effects of the seeds. We found that the 96% ecdysteroid increased the mass of the developing quails in a dose-dependent manner, with the rate of increase proportional to the ecdysteroid content in the seeds; there was a 115% increase in living mass with 100 mg kg-1 of pure 20E compared with 109.5% increase with 100-180 mg kg-1 20E equivalents in the seeds. We conclude that the plethora of growth-promoting, vitamin-like effects induced in vertebrates by Leuzea is mediated by ecdysteroids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Entomology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Praha, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Sl\u00e1ma", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Koudela", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tenora", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mathov\u00e1", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Experientia", "NlmUniqueID": "0376547", "ISSNLinking": "0014-4754"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5289-74-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Ecdysterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Coturnix"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ecdysterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Maturation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1986 Oct;12(10):1979-86", "ArticleIdList": ["24306462"]}, {"Citation": "Yakugaku Zasshi. 1972 Aug;92(8):945-50", "ArticleIdList": ["4674414"]}, {"Citation": "Chem Ber. 1965 Jul;98(7):2394-402", "ArticleIdList": ["5849855"]}, {"Citation": "Nauchnye Doki Vyss Shkoly Biol Nauki. 1984;(11):16-20", "ArticleIdList": ["6525371"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8698114", "10.1007/BF01925578"]}}]}
