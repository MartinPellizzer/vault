The physiochemical properties of the obtained compounds, as well as the Caco-2 cell-based permeability and uptake into hPepT1-MDCK cells were evaluated using various analytical methods. Scutellarin methyl ester-4'-Val-homo-Leu dipeptide (5k) was determined as the optimal candidate with a high apparent permeability coefficient (P<sub>app A to B</sub>) of 1.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup> cm/s, low ER (P<sub>app BL to AP</sub>/P<sub>app AP to BL</sub>) of 0.52 in Caco-2 cells, and high uptake of 25.47\u00a0\u03bcmol/mg/min in hPepT1-MDCK cells. Comprehensive mechanistic studies demonstrated that pre-treatment of PC12 cells with 5k resulted in more potent anti-oxidative activity, which was manifested by a significant decrease in the malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, attenuation of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptotic cell accumulation in the sub-G1 peak, and improvement in the expression of the relevant apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and cleave-caspase-3). Moreover, evaluation of in vivo neuroprotective characteristics in hypoxic-ischemic rat pups revealed that 5k significantly reduced infarction and alleviated the related pathomorphological damage. The compound was also shown to ameliorate the neurological deficit at 48\u00a0h as well as to decrease the brain tissue loss at 4\u00a0weeks. Conjugate 5k was demonstrated to reduce the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and \u03b2-site APP-converting enzyme-1 (BACE-1) expression. Pharmacokinetic characterization of 5k indicated favorable druggability and pharmacokinetic properties. The conducted docking studies revealed optimal binding of 5k to PepT1. Hydrogen bonding as well as cation-\u03c0 interactions with the corresponding amino acid residues in the target active site were clearly observed. The obtained results suggest 5k as a potential candidate for anti-HIE therapy, which merits further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
