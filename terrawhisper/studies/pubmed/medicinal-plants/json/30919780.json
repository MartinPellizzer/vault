Considering the chronic nature of the disease as well as the necessity for the long-term use of chemical medications, various side effects could occur that include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperkalemia, and kidney failure. Therefore, suitable treatments with fewer side effects should be recommended. Recent investigations suggest increased tendency in people to use Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for knee OA treatment.", "This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of herbal preparations for the treatment of OA.", "The searched databases were Cochrane, Scopus, and PubMed. All the selected papers pertained to randomized controlled trials until August 8, 2017 in English in which one or several specific herbs had been used in knee OA treatment.", "We included 24 randomized trials (involving 2399 women and men). There were several different herbal medicines used within the included trials.", "The results show that the methods used in these trials may reduce symptoms and the extent of NSAID consumption and enhance the quality of life. Additional trials are suggested to investigate the safety and efficacy of herbs for the treatment of patients with OA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D Candidate of Persian Medicine, Student Research Committee, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Teymouri", "ForeName": "Soudeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharm.D, Assistant Professor, Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hasan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baghdar", "ForeName": "Hamideh Naghedi", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant Professor of Drug Control, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salari", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Rheumatol Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101261938", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3971"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis, Knee"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30919780", "10.2174/1573397115666190328150203", "CRR-EPUB-97612"]}}]}
