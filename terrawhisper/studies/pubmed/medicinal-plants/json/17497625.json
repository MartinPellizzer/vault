The identities of the latter three major 2-glucosyloxycinnamic acids were confirmed by comparing their retention times, UV and mass spectra with those of the reference standards. The characteristic ESI-MSn fragmentation patterns of the remaining six 2-glucosyloxycinnamic acid derivatives, which are similar to the three major compounds, have allowed the putative elucidation of their structures. The concentrations of the cis-, trans- and dihydromelilotosides were simultaneously determined by HPLC/ESI-MS2 using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode in extracts of Dendrobium species. The method was validated with respect to the overall intra- and inter-day variation (RSD less than 8%) and the limits of quantification for the cis-, trans- and dihydromelilotosides were 0.09, 0.09 and 0.01 microg/mL, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Medicines of Ministry of Education, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1200 Cailun Road, Zhangjiang Hi-tech Park, Shanghai 201203, P.
