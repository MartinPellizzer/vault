Herein, a specific ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole trap tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) method was developed and used for the determination of monosaccharide composition of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP).", "Exploration of a new efficient method for monosaccharide determination.", "In our study, hydrochloric acid was used to hydrolyse the polysaccharide obtained from L. barbarum fruits. Principal component analysis (PCA) and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) analysis were used for comprehensive evaluation of the samples. The results showed that LBP was composed of seven monosaccharides: galactose, arabinose, mannose, rhamnose, xylose, ribose, and glucose. The linear relationship of the seven monosaccharides was optimum within a certain concentration range. Quantitative recoveries of the seven monosaccharides from the samples ranged from 94.76% to 102.11%.", "A rapid quantitative detection method was established, in which the hydrolysis time was reduced from 12\u00a0h to 2\u00a0h. By using LBP as one of the indexes to evaluate the quality of L. barbarum, L. barbarum from Zhongning County, Ningxia Province, was identified as having the best quality among the varieties tested.", "The UHPLC-QTRAP-MS/MS pre-column derivatisation method used in this study was simple, accurate, and sensitive, with good repeatability, and can be used for quality evaluation and origin distinction of L. barbarum and other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7920-8725"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Junlin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "He", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Daiyin", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Suying", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Nianjun", "Initials": "N"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017YFC1701600", "Agency": "National Key R&D Project", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017YFC1701602", "Agency": "National Key R&D Project", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lycium barbarum polysaccharide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mohammadhosseini M, Sarker SD, Akbarzadeh A.
