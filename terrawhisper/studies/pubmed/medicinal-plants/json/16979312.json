Among the plant species studied, an ethanolic extract of Dioscorea membranacea exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity, with an IC(50) value of 23.6 microg/ml. From this extract, eight compounds [two naphthofuranoxepins (1, 2), one phenanthraquinone (3), three steroids (4-6) and two steroidal saponins (7, 8)] were isolated and further investigated for their inhibitory properties of NO production. It was found that diosgenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnosyl (1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7) possessed the highest activity (IC(50)=3.5 microM), followed by dioscoreanone (3, IC(50)=9.8 microM) and dioscorealide B (2, IC(50)=24.9 microM). Regarding structural requirements of diosgenin derivatives for NO production inhibitory activity, compound 7 which has a rhamnoglucosyl moiety at C-3 exhibited much higher activity than compounds that have either a diglucosyl substitution (8) or its aglycone (9); whereas, hydroxyl substitution at position 8 of naphthofuranoxepin derivatives conferred higher activity than the methoxyl group. It is concluded that diosgenin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnosyl (1-->2)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7), dioscoreanone (3) and dioscorealide B (2) are active principles for NO inhibitory activity of Dioscorea membranacea. Compounds 1-3 were also tested for the inhibitory effect on LPS-induced TNF-alpha release in RAW 264.7 cells. The result revealed that 3 possessed potent activity against TNF-alpha release with an IC(50) value of 17.6 microM, whereas, 1 and 2 exhibited mild activity. The present study may support the use of Dioscorea membranacea by Thai traditional doctors for treatment of the inflammatory diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Hat-Yai, Songkhla 90112, Thailand. supinyat@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tewtrakul", "ForeName": "Supinya", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itharat", "ForeName": "Arunporn", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dioscorea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Smilax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Verbenaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16979312", "10.1016/j.jep.2006.08.009", "S0378-8741(06)00406-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
