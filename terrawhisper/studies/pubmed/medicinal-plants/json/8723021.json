This study was therefore designed to examine the effects of allicin, an active constituent of garlic, on the lipid profile in a rabbit model.", "Allicin was produced by reacting alliin, synthesized in our laboratory, with purified alliinase. Nineteen New Zealand White rabbits were fed a cholesterol-rich diet (0.25% cholesterol) for 18 weeks. Ten rabbits received freshly produced allicin (3 mg/kg orally) starting at 8 weeks, and nine received placebo. There was no significant difference between the lipid profiles of the two groups at baseline up to 8 weeks.", "From day 28 of allicin supplementation a significant difference was found between the allicin and placebo groups in the graph regression lines describing the influence of allicin on serum cholesterol: Y = 41.39 + 8.69 multiplied by day (control) versus Y = -877.24 + 17.67 multiplied by day (allicin). The same trend was found for low-density lipoprotein concentrations: Y = 10.3 + 8.4 multiplied by (control) versus Y = -750.4 + 15.7 multiplied by day (allicin). The serum high-density lipoprotein levels also differed significantly between the groups: Y = 20.29 + 0.24 multiplied by day (control) versus Y = -109.9 + 1.65 multiplied by day (allicin).", "Our results indicate that allicin has a beneficial effect on the serum lipid profile in hyperlipidemic rabbits, and should be further tested clinically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neufeld Cardiac Research Institute, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel."}], "LastName": "Eilat", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oestraicher", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rabinkov", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohad", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mirelman", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Battler", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eldar", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vered", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Coron Artery Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9011445", "ISSNLinking": "0954-6928"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3C39BY17Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "allicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8723021"]}}]}
