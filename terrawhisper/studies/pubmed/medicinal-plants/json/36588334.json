The ingredients used in ugadi pachadi have often also been used in food as well as traditional Ayurveda and Siddha medicinal preparations. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a diverse family of enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses which can infect humans and have the potential to cause large-scale outbreaks.", "Considering the benefits of ugadi pachadi, we investigated the binding modes of various phytochemical constituents reported from its ingredients against five targets of SARS-CoV-2.", "Flexible-ligand docking simulations were achieved through AutoDock version 1.5.6. Following 50ns of molecular dynamics simulation using GROMACS 2018.1 software and binding free energy (\u0394G<sub>bind</sub>) of the protein-ligand complexes were calculated using the g_mmpbsa tool. ADME prediction was done using Qikprop of Schrodinger.", "From the molecular docking and MM/PBSA results compound Eriodictin exhibited the highest binding energy when complexed with nucleocapsid N protein (6M3M) (-6.8 kcal/mol, - 82.46 kJ/mol), bound SARS-CoV-2-hACE2 complex (6M0J) (-7.4 kcal/mol, -71.10 kJ/mol) and Mpro (6XR3) (-8.6 kcal/mol, -140.21 kJ/mol). Van der Waal and electrostatic energy terms highly favored total free energy binding.", "The compounds Eriodictin, Vitexin, Cycloart-3, 24, 27-triol, Agigenin, Mangiferin, Mangiferolic acid, Schaftoside, 27-Hydroxymangiferonic acid, Quercetin, Azadirachtol, Cubebin, Isomangiferin, Isoquercitrin, Malicarpin, Orientin and procyanidin dimer exhibited satisfactory binding energy values when compared with standard molecules. The further iterative optimization of high-ranked compounds following validation by in vitro and in vivo techniques assists in discovering therapeutic anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Ooty, Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Jupudi", "ForeName": "Srikanth", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Guru Nanak Institutions Technical Campus, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."}], "LastName": "Rajala", "ForeName": "Srikala", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Ooty, Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Gaddam", "ForeName": "Narasimha Rao", "Initials": "NR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Ooty, Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Swaminathan", "ForeName": "Gomathi", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Safety Associate, IQVIA, Bangalore, Karnataka, India."}], "LastName": "Peesa", "ForeName": "Jaya Preethi", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Ooty, Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Rajagopal", "ForeName": "Kalirajan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research, Ooty, Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Azam", "ForeName": "Mohammed Afzal", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Comput Aided Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101265750", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4099"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36588334", "10.2174/1573409919666221230105758", "CAD-EPUB-128532"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
