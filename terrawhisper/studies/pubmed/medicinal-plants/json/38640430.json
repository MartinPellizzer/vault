This plant is native to, or cultivated for various oriental medicinal purposes in, multiple regions of Asia, including Korea, China, and Japan (Lee 1982; Kim et al. 1994). Eleven <i>Puccinia</i> species have been reported to infect <i>Lycium</i> species (Ot\u00e1lora et al. 2018). In May and October 2022, symptoms of rust disease caused by <i>Puccinia</i> sp. were observed on almost all the leaves of about 60 sprawling stems of <i>L. chinense</i> plants on the seashore of Jeju island, Korea (33\u00b014'15.0835\u2033N, 126\u00b030'53.40E). Brownish red (uredinium) or blackish brown (telium) pustules were observed on upper and lower surfaces of infected leaves. These symptoms were observed on about 40 <i>L. chinense</i> plants, barely growing between rocks on the seashore of Ulsan Metropolitan City, and on the about 20 <i>L. chinense</i> plants on a small home garden of Jindo-gun, Korea, in June and October 2023, respectively. Uredinia were amphigenous, individually scattered, but sometimes formed groups of two or three on leaves and sepals, ferruginous, pulverulent, and surrounded by a ruptured epidermis, often developing into blackish telia. Urediniospores were either ellipsoid or ovoid, approximately 29.3-34.9 \u00d7 17-24.3 \u03bcm, with yellowish walls, 1-2 \u03bcm thick. The germ pores were bizonate, and each band contained four pores covered by low papillae. Blackish-brown telia were observed on both leaf surfaces. Teliospores were broadly ellipsoidal, and rounded at the apex and towards the base. They were measured approximately 37.1-53.4 \u00d7 25-34.5 \u03bcm. The walls were light chestnut-brown and 2-3.7 \u03bcm thick, apically up to 5-9 \u03bcm thick. The swollen pedicel was persistent, basal, hyaline, smooth, and similar in length to the spores (Fig. 1). These morphological characteristics were similar to those of <i>P. tumidipes</i>, as described by Ot\u00e1lora et al. (2018). The representative specimens were preserved at the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency Herbarium (PQK220531, -230605, and -231026). The fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and cytochrome oxidase subunit 3(CO3) regions were amplified from the total DNA of the isolates, using the primer pairs ITS5, ITS4, CO3F1, and CO3R1 for phylogenetic analysis (White et al. 1990; Vialle et al. 2009). PCR products were sequenced (Celemics, Seoul, Korea), and deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers are shown in Fig. 2.). The combined ITS2 and CO3 sequences were grouped with those of other isolates of <i>P. tumidipes</i> in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). In November 2022, three pathogenicity tests were conducted using a urediniospore suspension made with the PQK220531 isolate in sterile distilled water. The suspension was smeared onto the upper surface of healthy <i>L. chinense</i> leaves. The three inoculated plants were kept in the dark at saturated moisture levels for 24 hours and placed in an isolated glasshouse together with the three control plants. After two weeks, uredinia of <i>P. tumidipes</i> were observed on the leaves of the inoculated plants, but not on the control plants. Although no spermogonial or aecial stage has been observed in Korea, our study has proven that <i>P. tumidipes</i> is the causal fungus of rust disease in <i>L. chinense</i>. This result is also the first discovery of the New-World <i>P. tumidipes</i> in Asia, showing this fungus is not limitedly distributed in America and suggesting further surveys be done on its exact geographical distribution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); viola23@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Hyeyoun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); mjryu9@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Ryu", "ForeName": "Minji", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); jinycat@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Eun Jin", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); bangjune@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Young Ju", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Gimcheon, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); bskang32@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Byeongsam", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ibaraki University, Faculty of Education, 2-1-1 Bunkyo, Mito, Ibaraki, Japan, 310-8215; yoshitaka.ono.grapes@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Yoshitaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tokyo University of Agriculture, 13126, Department of Agriu, 1737 Funako, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan, 243-0034; ok201403@nodai.ac.jp."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Ok-Kyung", "Initials": "OK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 65359, Plant Quarantine, 167, Yongjeon-ro, Gimcheon-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea, Plant Quarantine Technology Center, Gimcheon, Gyeongsanbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of), 39660; mycomania21@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seong-Jin", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38640430", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0121-PDN"]}}]}
