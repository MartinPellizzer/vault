In this study, ethyl acetate parts of aqueous extracts from P.\u00a0vulgaris L. (EtOAc-APV) were found to demonstrate potent acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in vitro. Therefore, this study was designed to further investigate the effects of EtOAc-APV on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced aging rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12) and given orally by gavage EtOAc-APV (100 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. SCOP (1 mg/kg, ip) was administered to rats 30 min before starting behavioral tests consecutively for 3 days. EtOAc-APV could attenuate SCOP-induced brain senescence in rats by improving behavioral performance and decreasing brain cell damage, which was associated with a notable reduction in AChE activity and MDA level, as well as an increase in SOD and GPx activities. Additionally, EtOAc-APV administration could reduce the expression of NF-\u03baB and GFAP, which showed an anti-neuroinflammatory effect on the SCOP-treated rat. Overall, the current study highlights P.\u00a0vulgaris L. as an antidementia dietary supplement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University , Tianjin 300072, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Zhuo", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Target Organ Injury, Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces , Tianjin 300162, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jingze", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University , Tianjin 300072, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Honggai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University , Tianjin 300072, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Target Organ Injury, Logistics University of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces , Tianjin 300162, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratories of Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics , Tianjin 300193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Changxiao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8475-6988"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High-Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University , Tianjin 300072, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Memory Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prunella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28001065", "10.1021/acs.jafc.6b04597"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
