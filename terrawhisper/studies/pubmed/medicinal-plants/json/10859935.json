There were 166 families and 1,218 species consisting of 23 families and 159 species of Pteridophyta, 4 families and 7 species of Gymnosperma, 113 families and 700 species of the dicotyledous Angiosperma, and 26 families and 353 species of monocotyledous Angiosperma. There are 229 families and 5,500 species of plants in Japan, 196 families and 3,019 species in Kyushu, and 228 families and 3,477 species in Taiwan. There are 11 species of endemic plants on Tanegashima and Yakushima, and the best known of them is Pinus armandii Francht. var. amamiana Hatsushima. There are 181 species of flora of flora limited to the northern element, including several important medicinal plants, such as Akebia quinata Decaisne and Zanthoxylum piperitum DC. The 69 species of flora limited to the southern element include several important tropical plants, such as Messerschmidia argentea Johnston and Clerodendrum inerme Gaertn. Most of these plants are distributed on both island, but some of are distributed only Tanegashima. We concluded that one of the temperate borderlines of Japanese flora in the temperate zone is the islands of Tokara. The flora of Tanegashima and Yakushima are having a closely affinity of plant species and having the rich plant species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satake", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaburagi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nozaki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katsuki", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kokuritsu Iyakuhin Shokuhin Eisei Kenkyusho Hokoku", "NlmUniqueID": "9807834", "ISSNLinking": "1343-4292"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}], "NumberOfReferences": "10"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10859935"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
