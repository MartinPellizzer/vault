Due to the various side effects of prescribed hypnotics, demand for new drugs is still high. Recent studies have suggested the adenosine receptor (AR) as a potential therapeutic target for insomnia, however, clinically useful hypnotics targeting AR are not yet available. In the present study, we evaluated the hypnotic effect of rosmarinic acid, a phenolic compound widely found in medicinal plants, through pentobarbital-induced sleep test, electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG), and immunohistochemistry in mice. The underlying mechanisms were assessed by pharmacological approach using 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and SCH5826, antagonists for A<sub>1</sub>R and A<sub>2</sub>AR, respectively. Receptor-binding assay and functional agonism were also performed. Our study provides a new evidence that rosmarinic acid has a direct binding activity (Ki\u00a0=\u00a014.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM) and agonistic activity for A<sub>1</sub>R. We also found that rosmarinic acid significantly decreased sleep fragmentation and onset latency to NREM sleep, and these effects were abolished by DPCPX. The results from c-Fos immunostaining showed that rosmarinic acid decreased the neuronal activity in wake-promoting brain regions, such as the basal forebrain and the lateral hypothalamus, while increasing the neuronal activity in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, a sleep-promoting region; all these effects were significantly inhibited by DPCPX. Taken together, this study suggests that rosmarinic acid possesses novel activity as an A<sub>1</sub>R agonist and thereby exerts a hypnotic effect, and thus it may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for insomnia through targeting A<sub>1</sub>R."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
