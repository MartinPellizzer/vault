The toxin may also cause hepatoma and liver diseases in the Thais as well. It is, therefore, necessary to search for and to develop efficient technology to combat and control such dangerous mold and mycotoxins. This paper is a collection of our previous and present studies towards reduction of risk from aflatoxins in foods and feedstuffs. The investigation of mold and aflatoxin contamination in local foods and feedstuffs in Chiang Mai area was made. The inhibitory effect of garlic extract on growth of Aspergillus flavus and its aflatoxin production was demonstrated. Detoxification of aflatoxins by chemicals such as ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate and ammonium benzoate was also shown. Preventions of toxigenic mold growth and its aflatoxin production by means of some food preservative were reported. Modifications of such effective chemicals were investigated for safety in future application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sutabhaha", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suttajit", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Niyomca", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kitasato Arch Exp Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0376613", "ISSNLinking": "0023-1924"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Additives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "45JP4345C9", "NameOfSubstance": "ammonium bicarbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NJ5VT0FKLJ", "NameOfSubstance": "ammonium carbonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Domestic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Additives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1479782"]}}]}
