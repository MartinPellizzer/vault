These herbs have the highest appearance rate in the literature, and their compounds are listed. The human protein-protein interaction network and the T2DM disease protein interaction network were constructed. Then, the related algorithm for network topology was used to perform interventions on the interaction network of disease proteins and normal human proteins to test different Chinese herbal medicine compound combinations, according to the information on the interaction of compounds-targets in two databases, namely TarNet and the Medicinal Plants Database. Results of the intervention scores indicate that the method proposed in this study can provide new effective combinations of Chinese herbal medicines for T2DM. Network pharmacology can effectively promote the modernization and development of TCM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 China Pharmaceutical University. Published by Elsevier B.V.
