Wistar rats were assigned into the blank group, carbon tetrachloride-induced liver fibrosis model group, and low-, medium-, and high-dose S. comosa groups. HE staining and Masson staining were performed for the observation of liver tissue under a microscope. Further, Wistar rats were assigned into a control group and a S. comosa group for administration. Seven days later, blood was collected from the abdominal aorta, and different doses of drug-containing serum samples were used to treat hepatic stellate cell-T6(HSC-T6). Flow cytometry was adopted to detect the apoptosis of HSC-T6 cells. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry(UHPLC-TOF-MS) was employed to determine the components in Scabiosa comosa. The target of S. comosa and liver fibrosis were obtained from SwissTargetPrediction and GeneCards, respectively, and the common targets were selected as the anti-liver fibrosis targets. Protein-protein interaction was analyzed via STRING. Gene Ontology(GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment were carried out via Metascape. Phosphatidylinosital 3-kinase(PI3 K), protein kinase B(AKT), p-AKT, p38, and p-p38 targets which are involved in the top-ranked PI3 K/AKT and mitogen activated kinase-like protein(MAPK) signaling pathways were selected for validation via Western blot. The HE and Masson staining results showed that Scabiosa alleviated the hyperplasia of connective tissue and the fibrosis. The serum containing Scabiosa significantly promoted the apoptosis of HSC-T6 in a concentration-dependent manner. A total of 76 chemical components were identified by UHPLC-TOF-MS, among which flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols, and fatty acids were the main components. According to the prediction, there were 63 anti-liver fibrosis targets in Scabiosa comosa, the annotated GO terms of which involved biological processes, cell components, and molecular functions. The KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the targets were mainly involved in PI3 K/AKT, epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), RAS-associated protein 1(Rap1), hypoxia-inducible factor 1(HIF-1), resistance to audiogenic seizures(Ras), and MAPK signaling pathways. Western blot results showed that compared with the model group, S. comosa down-regulated the protein levels of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin(\u03b1-SMA), collagen \u2160, PI3 K, AKT, p-AKT, p38, and p-p38 in liver tissue. Compared with the control group, the low-, medium-, and high-dose S. comosa significantly down-regulated the protein levels of \u03b1-SMA, collagen \u2160, PI3 K, AKT, p-AKT, p38, and p-p38 in HSC-T6. The evidence of pharmacodynamics, network pharmacology, and molecular biology indicated that the plants of S. comosa had significant activity against liver fibrosis, the mechanism of which may involve the regulation of the key targets PI3 K, AKT, and MAPK14 p38 in the PI3 K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yu-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yang", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lu", "Initials": "XL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University Hohhot 010059, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yue-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen Type I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen Type I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dipsacaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35850815", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220207.702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
