Vanillyl nonanoate was stable in nonpolar solvents, whereas it was labile in polar solvents. In particular, vanillyl nonanoate tended to decompose in protic solvents such as alcohol and water. Structures of the decomposition products from vanillyl nonanoate in methanol and ethanol were determined to be methyl and ethyl vanillyl ethers, respectively. To clarify the decomposition mechanism of capsinoid, six analogues of vanillyl nonanoate were tested. The stability of the analogues in organic solvents suggested that the hydroxyl group in the para-position of the benzene ring largely contributes to the decomposition of capsinoid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Nutritional and Environmental Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka 422-8526, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sutoh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kobata", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11513705", "10.1021/jf0103424", "jf0103424"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
