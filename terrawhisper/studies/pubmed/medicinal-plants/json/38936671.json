Of recent, anti-tumor pregnane glycosides were isolated from Gongronema latifolium leaf, of which the toxicity of one, 3-O-[6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-\u03b2-D-allopyranosyl-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a04)-\u03b2-D-oleandropyranosyl]-17\u03b2-marsdenin (3DMAOM), has not been evaluated. This study, therefore, evaluated the effects of 3DMAOM on selected brain and kidney function indices in mice. Female Swiss albino mice were randomly administered 5% dimethyl sulphoxide and different doses of 3DMAOM (0.5, 1, 2, and 4\u00a0mg/kg body weight) for fourteen (14) days, and their blood, brains, and kidneys were collected for biochemical analysis. There was no significant alteration in the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), acetylcholinesterase, creatine kinase, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase in the brain of the treated groups compared to control. Also, no significant changes in the activities of ALP, gamma-glutamyltransferase, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase in the kidney of the treated groups compared to control. The plasma concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, creatinine, and urea of mice were not significantly altered at all doses of the 3DMAOM compared to controls. However, the plasma concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at all doses of the 3DMAOM, and the plasma concentration of uric acid was significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 2\u00a0mg/kg body weight of the 3DMAOM compared to controls. These findings suggest that 3DMAOM isolated from Gongronema latifolium leaf may not adversely affect brain function but may affect calcium ion homeostasis in subjects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
