Et Zucc (Meliaceae) or chinaberry. TSN present in the medicinal plants was first isolated and established by spectroscopic methods. In this report, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation using columns of smaller particle size with tandem mass spectrometry (MS(n)) was used for the rapid determination of TSN in botanical extracts. A comparison of different fragmentation patterns shows that the results from positive and negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS(n) are complementary. The two modes can yield structurally significant information for the characterization and rapid identification of TSN in botanical extracts. The data obtained showed that MS(3) generated more characteristic ions that are useful for the identification of TSN in unknown samples. The separation of TSN was achieved with a water/acetonitrile gradient system using a short C18 reversed-phase column with small particle size (50 x 2.0 mm, 3.5 microm). With LC/MS, the quantitative analysis of TSN in the botanical extracts was done using external standard calibration and the method precision was found to vary from 4.3 to 7.6% (RSD, n = 5) on different days."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community, Occupational and Family Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 16 Medical Drive, Singapore. cofongcn@nus.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Choon Nam", "Initials": "CN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79304-40-8", "NameOfSubstance": "toosendanin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Melia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17262897", "10.1002/rcm.2878"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
