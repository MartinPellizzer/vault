Wound and wound infections are also major health problem. Nowadays, medicinal plants play a major role in treatment of infectious diseases and wound healing and they are easily available and more affordable as compared to synthetic compounds. The aim of this study is therefore, to investigate the antibacterial and wound healing activities of 80% methanol extract of Hibiscus micranthus leaves using disc diffusion methods and rat excision model respectively.", "In vitro antibacterial screening was carried out against S. aureus, S.pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis bacterial strains using disc-well diffusion assay. Would healing activity was done in rats divided into four groups each consisting of six animals. Group I was served as a negative control (ointment base), Group II served as a positive control Nitrofurazone (NFZ 0.2% ointment), Groups III and IV was treated 5 and 10% extracts respectively. The acute oral toxicity test and skin sensitivity test were also performed before conducting the actual study. The extract was analyzed for secondary metabolites using standard methods.", "Preliminary phytochemical screening have revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, steroids, phenols, diterpines, anthraquinones and the absence of glycosides, terpinoides and triterpines. Based on acute oral toxicity test the extract was found to be safe up to a dose of 2\u00a0g/kg. In addition, acute dermal toxicity test indicated no sign of skin irritation. The leaves extract exhibited varying degrees of sensitivity with zones of inhibition ranging from 14.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.333 (S.pyogenes) to 22.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.202\u00a0mm (S.aureus). It was found that S. aureus and S. pneumonia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were the most sensitive to the extracts of the leaves at concentrations of 800\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml respectively followed by P. aeuruginosa [(18.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0.333\u00a0mm) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05)] at a concentration of 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. However, E. coli and P. mirabilis were found to be resistant to the extract at any of the applied doses. In the wound healing study, the 5 and 10% w/w extract exhibited significant wound contraction rate of 99.30% and 99.13% as compared to NFZ ointment and simple ointment base treated groups from 6th to 16th day, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).", "The present study suggests that the methanol extract of the leaves exhibited a potential antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms and wound healing activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hospital Pharmacy, University of Gondar Teaching Referral Hospital, Gondar, Ethiopia. berhan.uog1912@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Begashaw", "ForeName": "Berhan", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Bharat", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Tsegaw", "ForeName": "Asegedech", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar, Gondar, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Shewamene", "ForeName": "Zewdneh", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMC Complement Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101088661", "ISSNLinking": "1472-6882"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hibiscus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}], "CoiStatement": "ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE: Ethical approval was obtained from School of Pharmacy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Gondar.
