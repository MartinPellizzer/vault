In the present study, apoptotic/necrotic macrophage death was analyzed in J774A.1 macrophages and in peritoneal macrophages isolated from atherosclerotic apoE-/- mice treated with PJ. The effects of PJ were compared with those of the free radical generator 2, 2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH). Both PJ and AAPH significantly increased J774A.1 macrophage death; however, flow cytometric and microscopic analyses using annexin V/propidium iodide revealed that PJ increased the early apoptosis of the macrophage dose dependently (up to 2.5-fold, P < 0.01), whereas AAPH caused dose-dependent increases in late apoptosis/necrosis (up to 12-fold, P < 0.001). Unlike PJ, AAPH-induced macrophage death was associated with increased intracellular oxidative stress (up to 7-fold, P < 0.001) and with lipid stress demonstrated by triglyceride accumulation (up to 3-fold, P < 0.01) and greater chromatic vesicle response to culture medium (up to 5-fold, P < 0.001). Accordingly, recombinant paraoxonase 1, which hydrolyzes oxidized lipids, attenuated macrophage death induced by AAPH, but not by PJ. Similar apoptotic and oxidative effects were found in macrophages from apoE-/- mice treated with PJ or AAPH. As macrophage apoptotic/necrotic death has considerable impact on atherosclerosis progression, these findings may provide novel mechanisms for the antiatherogenicity of PJ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "*The Lipid Research Laboratory, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; and \u2020Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University, Beer Sheva, Israel."}], "LastName": "Rom", "ForeName": "Oren", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Volkova", "ForeName": "Nina", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nandi", "ForeName": "Sukhendu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jelinek", "ForeName": "Raz", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aviram", "ForeName": "Michael", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cardiovasc Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902492", "ISSNLinking": "0160-2446"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7381JDR72F", "NameOfSubstance": "2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amidines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins E"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit and Vegetable Juices"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lythraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Knockout"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27010808", "10.1097/FJC.0000000000000391"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
