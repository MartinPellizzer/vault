Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancer types, including HCC and it involves alterations in various metabolic or nutrient-sensing pathways within liver cells to facilitate the rapid growth and progression of tumours. However, the role of STAT3-NF\u03baB in metabolic reprogramming is still not clear.", "Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) administered animals showed decreased body weight and elevated level of serum enzymes. Also, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed ultrastructural alterations. Increased phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (p-STAT3), phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (p-NF\u03ba\u03b2), dynamin related protein 1 (Drp-1) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) expression enhance the carcinogenicity as revealed in immunohistochemistry (IHC). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) concentration of IL-6 was found to be elevated in time dependent manner both in blood serum and liver tissue. Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed increased level of p-STAT3, p-NF\u03ba\u03b2 and IL-6 stimulated the upregulation of mitophagy proteins such as Drp-1, Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK-1). Meanwhile, downregulation of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and cleaved caspase 3 suppresses apoptosis and enhanced expression of AFP supports tumorigenesis. The mRNA level of STAT3 and Drp-1 was also found to be significantly increased. Furthermore, we performed high-field 800\u00a0MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) based tissue and serum metabolomics analysis to identify metabolic signatures associated with the progression of liver cancer. The metabolomics findings revealed aberrant metabolic alterations in liver tissue and serum of 75th and 105th days of intervention groups in comparison to control, 15th and 45th days of intervention groups. Tissue metabolomics analysis revealed the accumulation of succinate in the liver tissue samples, whereas, serum metabolomics analysis revealed significantly decreased circulatory levels of ketone bodies (such as 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetate, acetone, etc.) and membrane metabolites suggesting activated ketolysis in advanced stages of liver cancer.", "STAT3-NF\u03ba\u03b2 signaling axis has a significant role in mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic alterations in the development of HCC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
