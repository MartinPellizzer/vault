Despite the discovery of some terpene synthase (TPS) in C. indicum (i.e., CiTPS) in previous studies, many TPSs and their corresponding terpene biosynthesis pathways have yet to be discovered. In the present study, terpenoid VOCs in different tissues from two cytotypes of C. indicum were analyzed. We identified 52 types of terpenoid VOCs and systematically investigated the content and distribution of these compounds in various tissues. The two cytotypes of C. indicum exhibited different volatile terpenoid profiles. The content of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in the two cytotypes showed an opposite trend. In addition, four full-length candidate TPSs (named CiTPS5-8) were cloned from Ci-GD<sub>4x</sub>, and their homologous TPS genes were screened based on the genome data of Ci-HB<sub>2x</sub>. These eight TPSs displayed various tissue expression patterns and were discovered to produce 22 terpenoids, 5 of which are monoterpenes and 17 are sesquiterpenes. We further proposed corresponding terpene synthesis pathways, which can enable the establishment of an understanding of the volatile terpenoid profiles of C. indicum with different cytotypes. This knowledge may provide a further understanding of germplasm in C. indicum and may be useful for biotechnology applications of Chrysanthemum plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
