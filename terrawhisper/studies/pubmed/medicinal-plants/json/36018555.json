The plants have immense medicinal and economic importance (Chen et al., 2021). Large-scale artificial planting has led to the emergence of various viral diseases in <i>Paris polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i>, including paris virus 1 (ParV1), paris mosaic necrosis virus (PMNV), paris polyphylla virus X, and pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) (Chen et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022). However, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) had not been reported as a pathogen on this host. In September 2021, symptoms of leaf shrinking, withering and mottling, and the plants demonstrating dwarfing first observed on <i>Paris polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i> in Qujing Province, Yunnan, China (Suppl Figure 1A). Leaves with these characteristic symptoms were collected from 20 plants. Virus particles in the samples were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using negative staining (Zhang et al., 2016). These samples revealed the presence of rod-shaped virions, which were approximately 300 nm long with a diameter of approximately 18nm (Suppl Figure 1B). Based on particle morphology these were identified as a putative <i>Tobamovirus</i>. To further identify the exact virus, total RNA was obtained using an RNA-easy Isolation Reagent (TaKaRaBiotech, Dalian, China), cDNA synthesis was performed and RT-PCR assays allowed to amplify a fragment of the CP gene of TMV using specific primers (Suppl table 1). A 480 bp fragment (Suppl Figure 1C) was obtained and cloned into the pMD-18T vector (TaKaRa Biotech, Dalian, China) and sequenced. BLASTn- analysis revealed that the 20 amplicons were identical and shared coat sequence (100%) identity with the TMV isolates Mile-1 (acc. no. MK584554.1) and the diseased <i>P. polyphylla</i> was infected with TMV. The sequence was deposited in the GenBank database with the accession number OM366238 (CP). The sap from infected plants was used as inoculum for transmission of TMV to 10 healthy <i>Nicotiana glutinosa</i> and <i>N. tabacum</i> K326, respectively. 15 days post-inoculation, obvious symptoms of necrosis and chlortisis for viral infection were observed on inoculated and systemic leaves. The systemic leaves of 20 from two species plants were collected, and tested positive for TMV by RT-PCR with the specific primers (Suppl table 1). The sequences of the movement protein (MP) gene (807 bp, OM3662406) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (3351 bp, OM366242) of TMV were obtained by RT-PCR assays using MP-and RdRp-specific primers (Suppl Table 1). A disease incidence survey was conducted by our team in three <i>Paris polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i> fields in Qujing province and we observed a symptom incidence of 60% across all three fields. To confirm that the symptoms corresponded to TMV infection, leaf samples from 20 plants were collected from per field and all plants tested positive for TMV using RT-PCR assays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of TMV infection in <i>P. polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i> in China. This report, in combination with another recent report of new viruses (Paris mitovirus 1, Paris virus 2) that infects the plants (Chen et al., 2022), points toward a need to intensively monitor the viruses in fields to protect the <i>P. polyphylla</i> var. <i>yunnanensis</i> industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "kunming, China; 2304286125@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "kunming, China; 491395667@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mengqiu", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "wenshan, China; 340277402@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Yanan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "kunming, China; 26498532@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Si", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "kunming, China; zhaolihua1547@126.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhongkai", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2238# Beijing Rd, Wuhua prefecture, Kunming , Yunnankunming, China, 650205; 356429686@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36018555", "10.1094/PDIS-07-22-1539-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
