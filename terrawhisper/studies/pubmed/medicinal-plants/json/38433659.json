These plants are effective radical scavengers, that have been employed in treatment of nervous system disorders, and thus, could be beneficial for the management of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Current clinical treatments for NDs present several side effects, therefore, there is need to develop new treatments that can mitigate these deadly diseases. Hence, this study investigated the neuroprotective activities of SB leaf and seed in aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>)-induced toxicity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. HPLC characterization of the leaves and seeds were carried out. AlCl<sub>3</sub>-diet was used to induce neurodegeneration and treated flies received SB leaf and seed extracts-supplemented diet. Survival and locomotor performance activities/levels of oxidative biomarkers [reactive oxygen species (ROS), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), total thiol, catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)], enzymes linked with neurodegeneration (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO)) were investigated. SB leaf had significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) higher polyphenol contents; gallic acid and P-coumaric acid were the most abundant polyphenol in the leaf and seed respectively. Percentage survival and locomotor rates, level/activities of total thiol, catalase, SOD and GST were significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) reduced while ROS, TBARS, AChE and MAO activities were significantly (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05) increased in AlCl<sub>3</sub>-diet-fed flies. Treatment with SB leaf and seed diet lessened these observed impairments. However, SB leaf had better neuroprotective activities that could be related to the observed higher phenolic constituents. Hence, SB leaf diet may offer improved therapeutic effect in NDs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5262-7487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oyeniran", "ForeName": "Olubukola H", "Initials": "OH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2981-3553"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytomedicine and Molecular Toxicology Research Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Courage", "ForeName": "Famusiwa D", "Initials": "FD"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8325-1304"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods, Nutraceuticals and Phytomedicine Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ademiluyi", "ForeName": "Adedayo O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5167-9779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods, Nutraceuticals and Phytomedicine Unit, Department of Biochemistry, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oboh", "ForeName": "Ganiyu", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38433659", "10.1080/01480545.2024.2317828"]}}]}
