Eighty per cent of respondents had patients who had used the herb. Side-effects and drug interactions were reported by 28% and 8% respectively of these psychiatrists. Some adverse events were described as serious. Psychiatrist attitudes about St John's Wort and alternative treatments were positive overall and psychiatrists seemed willing to recommend St John's Wort despite limited evidence of its usefulness.", "Psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand regularly manage patients who take St John's Wort and a considerable number actually recommend the treatment. However, they also report side-effects and drug interactions. Psychiatrists should routinely enquire about their patients' use of alternative treatments, be mindful of possible side-effects and in particular be aware of the dangers of combining St John's Wort with other psychotropics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rivendell Unit, Concord West, New South Wales, Australia. gwalter@mail.usyd.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Walter", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rey", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Harding", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "0111052", "ISSNLinking": "0004-8674"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "New Zealand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Psychiatry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11127631", "10.1080/000486700275"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
