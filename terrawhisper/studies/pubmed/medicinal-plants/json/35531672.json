Based on the theory and technology in ecological cultivation of Chinese medicinal materials, this study analyzed the challenges in ecological cultivation of G. elata, such as waste of fungus material, a few cultivation modes available, continuous cropping obstacles, frequent occurrence of diseases, and poor stability of ecological structure. According to the production practice, the following suggestions were proposed for ecological cultivation of G. elata: following the principle of environmental protection and no pollution, selecting suitable habitats to yield high-quality medicinal materials, committing to green control of diseases and pests, upgrading industrial structure to maximize the benefits, establishing a sound mechanism for protecting the genetic diversity of wild G. elata, carrying out simulative habitat cultivation to improve medicinal material quality, adopting science-based planning of fungus resources to relieve forestry pressure, enhancing the recycling and utilization of fungus materials, and applying diversified cultivation modes to improve the stability of ecological structure. The result is expected to provide a reference for the quality development of G. elata industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-Qiang", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming University of Science and Technology Kunming 650031, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ye", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Qing-Song", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shandong Analysis and Test Center Ji'nan 250014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35531672", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220218.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
