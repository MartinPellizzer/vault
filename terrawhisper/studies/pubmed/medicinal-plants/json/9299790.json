Its amino acid composition and the pattern of its regulated accumulation in developing seeds led to the suggestion that narbonin could be a storage protein. Therefore, it was expected to be present in protein bodies of the storage tissue cells. Comparison of the cDNA-derived amino acid sequence with a directly determined partial N-terminal sequence revealed that the primary translation product of narbonin mRNA lacks a transient N-terminal signal peptide (V.H. Nong et al., 1995, Plant Mol Biol 28: 61 - 72). Narbonin polypeptides that had been synthesized in a cell-free translation system supplemented with dog pancreas microsomes were not protected against degradation by posttranslationally added proteases (protease protection assay). In accordance with the lack of a signal peptide this indicates that the polypeptide was not cotranslationally sequestered into the microsomes. The protein-body fraction that had been isolated from mature narbon bean cotyledons by a non-aqueous gradient centrifugation procedure was free of narbonin; this was found in the soluble cell fraction. In electron micrographs, narbonin could be localized in the cytoplasm using the immuno gold-labelling technique. Previously, it had already been shown that narbonin is too slowly degraded during narbon bean germination to act as a storage protein. From all these results it has to be concluded that narbonin is a cytoplasmic protein which does not belong to the storage proteins in the restricted sense. Other possible functions are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pflanzengenetik und Kulterpflanzenforschung, Gatersleben, Germany."}], "LastName": "Steffens", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van", "ForeName": "H N", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hillmer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saalbach", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcntz", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "narbonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell-Free System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Immunoelectron"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Subcellular Fractions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9299790", "10.1007/s00050163"]}}]}
