The components were quantitatively determined with normalization method, and identified by GC-MS.", "From the aeration dried sample and the dried sample after sulfur-burnin fumigation, 216 and 211 components were detected, among them fifty and six-five components were identified, which were composed of 73.21% and 82.32% of the total essential oil, respectively.", "The yield of the essential oil extracted from the aeration dried sample was 3.50%, and that from the dried sample after sulfur-bumin fumigation was 4.22%. The latter is 1.2 times higher than the former. The components of the essential oil of both samples are mostly monoterpenoids and secondly sesquiterpenoids compounds, but there are marked differences between the compounds contained in the two samples. Therefore, the processing of flowers of the C. morifolium should be strictly controlled and standardized."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiu-Wei", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Wen-Bin", "Initials": "WB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17639980"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
