Rosa roxburghii extract (RRE) has unique advantages in anti-PLGC due to its multi-component, high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the astringency and instability of RRE in the digestive tract seriously hinder its clinical application. Herein, we report a chitosan-based food-grade Pickering emulsion (PE) for loading RRE to block unpleasant taste, improve stability, and promote the entry of RRE into gastric epithelial cells through the gastric adhesion of chitosan, thereby enhancing preventive and therapeutic effects against PLGC. This Pickering emulsion is constructed as a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion stabilized by the food-grade nanoparticles composed of soybean protein isolate (SPI) and chitosan (CS) through electrostatic interaction (defined as RRE@PE). The experimental results showed that RRE@PE performed better efficacy against PLGC than RRE by scavenging or inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation and reducing inflammatory cytokines. This Pickering emulsion enhances the application potential of RRE and is expected to be used for the treatment of clinical patients with PLGC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
