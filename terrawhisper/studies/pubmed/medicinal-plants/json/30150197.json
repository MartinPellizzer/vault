These plants are abundant in Khyber Pukhtoon Khawa, Pakistan as well as in all over the world and famous for their unique medicinal importance. These herbaceous species are so far used for animals curing while current exploration of these species showed that these species are a precious resource of various compounds which can be employed in the formation of different drugs. The results showed that the leaf and flower extracts of Adhatoda vasica and leaf extract of Calotropis procera contained higher contents of bioactive compounds. The chemical analysis of the samples resulted in higher values of total phenolic compounds (71.32mg GAE/g), total antioxidants (651% DPPH inhibition), the enzyme catalase (4716\u00b5g/g), ash content (16.72%) and pH values in the Calotropis procera, whereas the total carotenoids (1987mg/100g), the enzymes, superoxide dismutase (4566\u00b5g/g) and peroxidase (1322\u03bcg/g) were higher in leaves of Adhatoda vasica. The flower extract of the Adhatoda vasica was rich in the flavonoids (0.87mg/100g) and organic matter (89.99%) as compared to Calotropis procera. The obtained data for each parameter was interpreted by applying Complete Randomized Design (CRD) along with factorial arrangements. The mean comparison was performed using LSD test at 5% probability level. The presence of these phytochemicals may lead to the conclusion that these herbal plants have the potential for formation of new drugs and can be used as herbal medicine for treatment of different cancer and viral diseases. These compounds are also useful in the treatment of the tumor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Waseem", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Azmat", "ForeName": "Rafia", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shah Masaud", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "M Safeer", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qayyum", "ForeName": "Abdul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mehmood", "ForeName": "Ayaz", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Sami Ullah", "Initials": "SU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Haripur, Haripur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Ijaz", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acanthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30150197"]}}]}
