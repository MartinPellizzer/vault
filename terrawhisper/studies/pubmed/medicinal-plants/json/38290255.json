The exact pathogenesis of SLE is still a matter of debate. However, it has been suggested that the binding of autoantibodies to autoantigens forms immune complexes (ICs), activators of the immune response, in SLE patients. Ultimately, all of these responses lead to an imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in cumulative inflammation. IL-35, the newest member of the IL-12 family, is an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory cytokine secreted mainly by regulatory cells. Structurally, IL-35 is a heterodimeric cytokine, composed of Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 (EBI3) and p35. IL-35 appears to hold therapeutic and diagnostic potential in cancer and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarized the most recent associations between IL and 35 and SLE. Unfortunately, the comparative review of IL-35 in SLE indicates many differences and contradictions, which make it difficult to generalize the use of IL-35 in the treatment of SLE. With the available information, it is not possible to talk about targeting this cytokine for the lupus treatment. So, further studies would be needed to establish the clear and exact levels of this cytokine and its related receptors in people with lupus to provide IL-35 as a preferential therapeutic or diagnostic candidate in SLE management."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
