Accurate species quantification remains challenging, as current methods often yield inconsistent results. This study introduces a novel pyrosequencing-based technique, termed herb molecular quantification (Herb-Q), designed to precisely quantify herbal products. We evaluated its effectiveness using Pinellia ternata and five of its adulterants. Initially, we assessed commonly used DNA barcodes with sequences from a public database, identifying two candidate regions, Maturase K (matK) and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), for screening specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci, allowing for species-specific identification. These loci were validated by amplifying and sequencing genomic material from collected samples. Our validation studies showed that Herb-Q demonstrated excellent linearity, accuracy, repeatability, and detection limits. We established quantitative standard curves with high R<sup>2</sup> values (> 0.99) to enable precise species quantification, which were combined with external standards to provide clear and accurate visual quantification results. The average bias in quantifying the tuber of P. ternata was 2.38%, confirming that Herb-Q can accurately identify and quantify herbal product constituents. Moreover, the entire quantification process took less than 4 h. This study presents a novel, rapid method for accurately quantifying species in herbal products and advances the application of DNA barcoding from species identification to quantitative detection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 China Pharmaceutical University.
