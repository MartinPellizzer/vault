We prospectively evaluated the effect of Gahat consumption on 24-hour urine parameters in an attempt to assess its in vivo effect in normal volunteers.", "Eight non-stone-forming volunteers collected 24-hour urine specimens while on their routine diets for baseline data. Urine was analyzed for pH, volume, calcium, citrate, phosphate, sodium, magnesium, uric acid, and oxalate. The Gahat was prepared according to local custom. No additives were used to enhance flavor. The pureed mixture (8 ounces) was ingested three times daily for 2 days. Subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet, including fluid intake and activity during the study period. Twenty-four hours after the start of Gahat intake, a second 24-hour urine collection was initiated while volunteers continued the Gahat. Results of the urine samples before and after Gahat intake were analyzed, using the paired Student t test.", "There were no significant differences in urinary electrolytes between the urine samples before and after Gahat intake. Magnesium, urine volume, and uric acid differences approached clinical significance.", "Gahat increased urinary magnesium through an unknown mechanism and had no effect on other routine 24-hour urine electrolytes. The increase in urinary volume is attributed to the increase in fluid consumption by the subjects. If this legume is effective in preventing or dissolving urinary calculi, it may act through mechanisms not identified in 24-hour urine electrolytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schwartz", "ForeName": "B F", "Initials": "BF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schenkman", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stoller", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Urology", "NlmUniqueID": "0366151", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4295"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Citrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I38ZP9992A", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Citrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nepal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Calculi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11113729", "10.1016/s0090-4295(00)00840-2", "S0090-4295(00)00840-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
