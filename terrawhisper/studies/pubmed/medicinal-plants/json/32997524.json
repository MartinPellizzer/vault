The experiment was done under greenhouse conditions. The applied treatments tested in this experiment for Cd concentrations were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\u2009ppm and for Pb: 100, 350, 750, 1,000, 1,500\u2009ppm. The composition and amount of EOs had been determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that the contaminated soil had a negative impact on morphological traits development of basil (<i>e.g.</i>, the decline in fresh and dry weight). The increase in Cd and Pb concentrations enhanced the EOs yield of sweet basil. In general, basil cultivation in the Cd and Pb contaminated soils could cause undesirable impacts on morphological traits; however, the presence of these metals has a major influence on the EOs yield, composition, and phytoremediation of the soil."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Science, Botany & Microbiology Department, Sohag University, Sohag, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Youssef", "ForeName": "Naglaa A", "Initials": "NA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum basilicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32997524", "10.1080/15226514.2020.1812508"]}}]}
