The molecular weights were determined by fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The glycosyl and elemental composition of all the saponins was determined by applying our recently developed method, monomer mapping, consisting of a computer program and accurate mass measurements. Support for the presumed identity of the aglycone, i.e. quillaic acid, was found in the accurate mass determination, 1H NMR measurement and chemical reactions. The saponin composition of Quil A was shown to consist of pairs. Within the 3-O bound glycosyl moiety of a pair there was a structural difference: a pentose and rhamnose were interchanged. Structural differences between different pairs were located in the 28-O bound glycosyl moiety. A structural element, unknown to date and of which the elemental composition was deduced to be C8H12O5, was found in the 28-O bound glycosyl moiety of several saponins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Setten", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van de Werken", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zomer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kersten", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7647364", "10.1002/rcm.1290090808"]}}]}
