However, the yields of these metabolites are generally very low, making their extraction both time- and labour-consuming. Transcription factor (TF)-targeted secondary metabolic engineering can efficiently regulate the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. v-Myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB) TFs are involved in regulating various morphological and developmental processes, responses to stress, and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in plants. This review discusses the biological functions and transcription regulation mechanisms of MYB TFs and summarises the research progress concerning MYB TFs involved in the biosynthesis of representative active components. In the transcriptional regulatory network, MYB TFs regulate multiple synthase genes to mediate active ingredient biosynthesis. This study will serve as a reference for the in-depth analysis of the MYB TF family in medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
