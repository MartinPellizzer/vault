We find that formate inhibition of PS II turnover rates increases as the pH of the reaction medium is lowered. Bicarbonate ions can inhibit PS II turnover rates. The relative potency of the anionic inhibitors N-3, I-, OA-c, and Cl- is the same for both carbonic anhydrase and PS II. The inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on PS II increases as light intensity decreases, indicating a lowering of quantum yields in the presence of the inhibitor. Imidazole inhibition of PS II increases with pH in a manner suggesting that the unprotonated form of the compound is inhibitory. Formate, bicarbonate, acetazolamide, and imidazole all inhibit DCMU-insensitive, silicomolybdate-supported oxygen evolution, indicating that the site(s) of action of the inhibitors is at, or before, the primary stable PS II electron acceptor, Q. This inhibitory effect of low levels of HCO-3 along with the known enhancement by HCO-3 of quinone-mediated electron flow suggests an antagonistic control effect on PS II photochemistry. We conclude that the responses of PS II to anions (formate, bicarbonate), acetazolamide, and imidazole are analogous to the responses shown by carbonic anhydrase. These findings suggest that the enzyme carbonic anhydrase may provide a model system to gain insight into the \"bicarbonate-effect\" associated with PS II in chloroplasts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stemler", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jursinic", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bicarbonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Formates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Imidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O3FX965V0I", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetazolamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetazolamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Bicarbonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Formates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Imidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6830257", "10.1016/0003-9861(83)90139-x", "0003-9861(83)90139-X"]}}]}
