The crosses were planned to test for cytoplasmic inheritance of male sterility. In four locations significant differences between reciprocal crosses were observed. The progenies of these reciprocal crosses were used in a crossing scheme designed to test whether these reciprocal differences were caused by different cytoplasmic types between the plants. In all four locations, the existence of at least two cytoplasmic types could be shown. Moreover, the results of the crosses between locations showed that the same two cytoplasmic types were present in all four locations. We therefore argue that there is only limited cytoplasmic variation in P. coronopus. In each cytoplasmic type a series of intermediate sex forms occurred. A marked difference in restoration level existed between the two cytoplasmic types. Plants with cytoplasmic type 2 hardly segregated male steriles, in contrast to plants with cytoplasmic type 1."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Netherlands Institute of Ecology, Department of Plant Population Biology, Heteren."}], "LastName": "Koelewijn", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Damme", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Genetics", "NlmUniqueID": "0374636", "ISSNLinking": "0016-6731"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crosses, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Stain Technol. 1969 May;44(3):117-22", "ArticleIdList": ["4181665"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1995 Apr;139(4):1759-75", "ArticleIdList": ["7789776"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Gen Genet. 1982;186(1):50-6", "ArticleIdList": ["6287168"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7789775", "PMC1206500", "10.1093/genetics/139.4.1749"]}}]}
