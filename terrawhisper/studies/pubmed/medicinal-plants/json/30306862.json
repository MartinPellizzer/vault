Both the endemic and native plants species serve as a rich bank of phytochemicals.", "In this study, \"Sri Lankan Flora\" an online web-based information system of phytochemical compounds isolated from the flora of Sri Lanka was proposed.", "The database contained 3D structures of those compounds, calculated quantitativestructure- activity relationship (QSAR) data and the GROMOS 54a7 force field parameters for each and every compound. The manually curated chemical structures, activities and force field parameters provide a possible direct avenue for computer-aided drug discovery. The present study is a continuing project with a wider goal of building up a database, not only for assisting the computeraided drug designing process, but also for other chemical applications, as the database includes structural, physical, chemical and dynamic properties of chemical compounds of the flora of Sri Lanka.
