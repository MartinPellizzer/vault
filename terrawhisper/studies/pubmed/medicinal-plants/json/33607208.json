Inhibition of these enzymes with small molecule inhibitors may restore therapeutic sensitivity. Here, we demonstrated ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcH5b strongly supports HECTD3 auto-ubiquitination in vitro. Based on this, we developed a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay and identified three Schisandraceae triterpenoids, including PC3-15, to block HECTD3/UbcH5b auto-ubiquitination. Furthermore, we revealed that PC3-15 directly binds to UbcH5b and also inhibits UbcH5b-mediated p62 ubiquitination. We found that the UbcH5b-p62 axis confers TNBC cells resistance to lapatinib by promoting autophagy. Consistently, PC3-15 inhibits lapatinib-induced autophagy and increases lapatinib sensitivity in TNBC in vitro and in mouse xenografts. These findings suggest that the UbcH5b-p62 axis provides potential therapeutic targets and that Schisandraceae triterpenoids may be used for TNBC treatment in combination with lapatinib."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
