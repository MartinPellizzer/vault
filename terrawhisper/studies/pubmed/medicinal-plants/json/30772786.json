The Pergularia tomentosa L. is a medicinal plant that traditionally, applies for treatment of burning, in Bushehr province, Iran. Various bioactive compounds such as steroid glycosides, tannins, various vitamins, saponins, cardenolides and anthraquinones were identified into extract of the plant, which can be effective in burn wound healing. Twenty-one rats weighting every one 200\u00b15 grams were divided equally into three groups. The second-degree burning induced on all groups. One of groups did not receive any treatment (The control group) and was treated locally with saline and eucerin. The Second group received the P. tomentosa L. as a topical ointment, and the third group received locally, a thin layer of silver sulfadiazine ointment 3% after washing the wound with saline. Afterward treatment period, the microscopic slides from histological sections were prepared. At that point, amounts of the fibroblast cells, blood vessels, wound area, necrotic tissues, and diameter of epidermis rate of wound healing were determined. Also the exterior status of wound in different days was considered. Results obtained from current study have revealed that the extract of P. tomentosa L. can significantly, cause qualitative and quantitative acceleration in healing of second degree burn wounds, due to their bioactive and vasoactive properties. In conclusion the P. tomentosa L. can is used as an overborne medicine with lower cost and side effect than the similar chemical medicines. Although, the further studies are needed on these plants, due to their some toxic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farzadinia", "ForeName": "Parviz", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran / Food and Drug Department, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohebbi", "ForeName": "Gholamhossein", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bargahi", "ForeName": "Afshar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akbarzadeh", "ForeName": "Samad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nabipour", "ForeName": "Iraj", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdi", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasanpour", "ForeName": "Zeynab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alipour", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Marine Toxinology, The Persian Gulf Marine Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Daneshi", "ForeName": "Adel", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W46JY43EJR", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver Sulfadiazine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Silver Sulfadiazine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30772786"]}}]}
