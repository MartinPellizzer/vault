The study on its molecular markers development and germplasm resources is very important. In this study, we obtained 24 422 unigenes by assembling transcriptome sequencing reads of L. chuanxiong root. EST-SSR was detected and 4 073 SSR loci were identified. EST-SSR distribution and characteristic analysis results showed that the mono-nucleotide repeats were the main repeat types, accounting for 41.0%. In addition, the sequences containing SSR were functionally annotated in Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway and were assigned to 49 GO categories, 242 KEGG pathways, among them 2 201 sequences were annotated against Nr database. By validating 235 EST-SSRs,74 primer pairs were ultimately proved to have high quality amplification. Subsequently, genetic diversity analysis, UPGMA cluster analysis, PCoA analysis and population structure analysis of 34 L. chuanxiong germplasm resources were carried out with 74 primer pairs. In both UPGMA tree and PCoA results, L. chuanxiong resources were clustered into two groups, which are believed to be partial related to their geographical distribution. In this study, EST-SSRs in L. chuanxiong was firstly identified, and newly developed molecular markers would contribute significantly to further genetic diversity study, the purity detection, gene mapping, and molecular breeding."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Can", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ze-Mao", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Wen-Juan", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Mou", "ForeName": "Fang-Sheng", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Yi-Yun", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Pei-Cheng", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "De-Qiang", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industrial Crop Research Institute, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu 610300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Expressed Sequence Tags"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192443", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170814.004"]}}]}
