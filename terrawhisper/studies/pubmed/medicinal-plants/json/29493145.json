And then the correlation between the habitat, phenotype and quality of H. acerba seeds were deeply studied. There were big differences in both appearance and quality among the H. acerba seeds from different places. It showed that the content of dihydromyricetin in H. acerba seeds was 0.41-9.81 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9, and the content of total flavonoids was 5.52-21.98 mg\u2022g\u207b\u00b9. The cluster analysis showed that the quality of H. acerba seeds was related to the habitat. The samples from Jianghan Plain Area showed relatively stable and excellent quality. According to the correlation analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between 1 000-seeds weight, red-black seeds ratio and the content of dihydromyricetin, while the content of total flavonoids was not related to the 1 000-seeds weight and red-black seeds ratio. So the 1 000-seeds weight and red-black seeds ratio could be used as an initial judgment of the quality of H. acerba seeds. As dihydromyricetin and total flavonoids content was not related, both dihydromyricetin and total flavonoids should be taken into account when the quality of H. acerba seeds was studied."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infinite Pole(China) Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510623, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jia-Liang", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infinite Pole(China) Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510623, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xia", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310053, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Research Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Co., Ltd., Hangzhou 310023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhi-An", "Initials": "ZA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29493145", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20171030.017"]}}]}
