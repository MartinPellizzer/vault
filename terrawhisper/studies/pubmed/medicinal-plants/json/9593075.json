Ferulinolol markedly inhibited the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol but did not show any blocking effect on the arterial pressor responses induced by (-)phenylephrine. These findings clearly suggested that ferulinolol had a beta-adrenergic blocking activity; nevertheless, it did not involve an alpha-adrenergic blocking action. In isolated guinea pig tissues, ferulinolol competitively antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol suggested that ferulinolol was a beta-adrenoceptor-competitive antagonist. The apparent pA2 values for ferulinolol on right atria, left atria, and trachea were 7.62 +/- 0.05, 7.54 +/- 0.01, and 6.28 +/- 0.11, respectively. Ferulinolol was more potent on the atria than on tracheal tissues, demonstrating that it possessed beta1-adrenoceptor selectivity. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of ferulinolol and propranolol were determined on isolated atria and trachea from reserpine-treated guinea pig. Propranolol caused significantly negative inotropic and chronotropic effects at > or =1 microM, whereas ferulinolol possessed fewer cardiodepressant activities than propranolol. In reserpine-treated tracheal strips, ferulinolol produced dose-dependent relaxant responses, but propranolol was without effectiveness. Preincubating the preparations with ICI 118,551 (0.1, 1.0, and 10 nM), a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly shifted the concentration-relaxation curves of ferulinolol to a region of higher concentrations. These results implied that ferulinolol had a partial beta2-agonist activity. Further, binding characteristics of ferulinolol and various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were evaluated in [3H]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricular or lung membranes. The Ki values of ferulinolol, atenolol, metoprolol, and (-)propranolol were 103, 262, 123, and 0.23 nM, respectively, in ventricular membranes, and 2,412, 7,539, 2,186, and 0.72 nM, respectively, in lung membranes. In conclusion, ferulinolol was found to be a highly selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta2-agonist activity but was devoid of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "B N", "Initials": "BN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "I J", "Initials": "IJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cardiovasc Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902492", "ISSNLinking": "0160-2446"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiopharmaceuticals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulinolol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AVM951ZWST", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-2 Receptor Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Radiopharmaceuticals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9593075", "10.1097/00005344-199805000-00014"]}}]}
