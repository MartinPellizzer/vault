In order to explain the mechanism of Antoxid inhibiting effect on lipid peroxidation stimulated by xylene, its influence on hydroxyl radical generation was examined. The preventing and repairing effect of Antoxid was evaluated towards the lipid peroxidation stimulated with xylene by treatment before or after exposition. The results showed that the various combinations of Antoxid with vitamin C possessed antioxidative properties, but the significant synergistic effect was noted for weight ratio 1:1 of Antoxid and vitamin C in concentration 5 microg/mL. Antoxid didn't decrease the hydroxyl radicals level produced by xylene. Both preventing and repairing effect of Antoxid in oxidative stress caused by xylene is not connected with hydroxyl radical scavenging."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology, Medical University, 57/59 Traugutta Str., 50-417 Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Przybylska", "ForeName": "Dorota", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u0142ugosz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antoxid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3352-57-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyl Radical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18323241"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
