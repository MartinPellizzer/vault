In previous studies, garlic elicited a reduction in plasma levels of lipids by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The aim of this study was to investigate in an in vivo model the effects of garlic extract and some fractions on cholesterol levels and vascular reactivity in cholesterol-fed rats. Rats were fed a cholesterol-enriched diet for 16 wk and were divided into 10 groups as follows: control and hypercholesterolemic diet groups, 4 groups fed frozen garlic fractions and 4 groups fed raw garlic fractions with different doses. Blood samples were obtained to analyze HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. After treatment, rats were killed. The heart, liver and kidneys were weighed; the aorta was isolated, mounted in organ chambers and vascular reactivity was tested. Plasma concentration of cholesterol was 58 mg/dL (100%) at the beginning of the study and increased to 102 mg/dL (153%; hypercholesterolemic group) at the end of the treatment. Plasma total cholesterol decreased in all groups treated with garlic; moreover, this effect was higher in rats fed raw garlic fractions and extracts. LDL decreased significantly with respect to the hypercholesterolemic group in all groups treated with garlic fractions and extracts (P: < 0.01); however, an increase in HDL was found in those treated with frozen fractions and extracts. The liver:body weight ratio decreased in all treated groups. The relaxing effect of acetylcholine (ACh) was enhanced in arteries contracted with noradrenaline (NE). These data suggest that garlic fractions could prevent diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and vascular alterations in the endothelium-dependent relaxation associated with atherosclerosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Slowing", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ganado", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sanz", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ruiz", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tejerina", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticholesteremic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arteriosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11238804", "10.1093/jn/131.3.994S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
