Induction of proinflammatory pathways plays a crucial role in chronic inflammation, gastric carcinoma, and H. pylori pathogenesis. Herbal medicines (HMs) are nontoxic, inexpensive, and mostly anti-inflammatory reminding meticulous emphasis on the elimination of H. pylori and gastric cancer. Several HM has exerted paramount anti-H. pylori traits. In addition, they exert anti-inflammatory effects through several cellular circuits such as inhibition of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-\u03baB, and activator protein-1 pathway activation leading to the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 1\u03b1 [IL-1\u03b1], IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, interferon \u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) expression. Furthermore, they inhibit nitrous oxide release and COX-2 and iNOS activity. The apoptosis induction in Th1 and Th17-polarized lymphocytes and M2-macrophagic polarization and STAT6 activation has also been exhibited. Thus, their exact consumable amount has not been revealed, and clinical trials are needed to achieve optimal concentration and their pharmacokinetics. In the aspect of bioavailability, solubility, absorption, and metabolism of herbal compounds, nanocarriers such as poly lactideco-glycolide-based loading and related formulations are helpful. Noticeably, combined therapies accompanied by probiotics can also be examined for better clearance of gastric mucosa. In addition, downregulation of inflammatory microRNAs (miRNAs) by HMs and upregulation of those anti-inflammatory miRNAs is proposed to protect the gastric mucosa. Thus there is anticipation that in near future HM-based formulations and proper delivery systems are possibly applicable against gastric cancer or other ailments because of H. pylori."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1243-6341"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemian", "ForeName": "Abdolmajid", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Training in Skin Disease and Leprosy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fattahi", "ForeName": "Azam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shokouhi Mostafavi", "ForeName": "Seyyed Khalil", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Science for Women, Babylon University, Babylon, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Almarzoqi", "ForeName": "Ali Hussein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Skin Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Memariani", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Microorganisms and Active Biomolecules, Faculty of Sciences of Tunis, University of Tunis El-Manar, El Manar, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ben Braiek", "ForeName": "Olfa", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Research Center, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar."}], "LastName": "Yassine", "ForeName": "Hadi M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mostafavi", "ForeName": "Neda Sadat Shokouhi", "Initials": "NSS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Kerbala, Kerbala, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Mohanad Mohsin", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirforughi", "ForeName": "Seyede Amene", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter pylori"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30847906", "10.1002/jcp.28363"]}}]}
