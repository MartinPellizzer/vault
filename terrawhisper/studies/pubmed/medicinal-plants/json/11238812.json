These compounds have been shown to reduce the incidence of a multitude of chemically induced tumors in animal models. The impediment of phase I activation of these carcinogens is hypothesized to be accountable for the reduction in tumor incidence. Indeed, DAS, DASO and DASO(2) are competitive inhibitors of CYP2E1. DASO(2), in addition, is a suicide inhibitor of CYP2E1. These compounds have been shown to reduce carbon tetrachloride-, N-nitrosodimethylamine- and acetaminophen-induced toxicity in rodents. All three chemicals are substrates for CYP2E1. The protective effect was observed when the organosulfur compounds were given before, during or soon after chemical treatment. DAS and DASO(2) inhibited the bioactivation of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and related lung tumorigenesis in A/J mice. Because CYP2E1 does not play a key role in NNK activation, the inhibition of other CYP enzymes active in NNK metabolism is likely. DAS also has been shown to induce other CYP and phase II enzymes as well as decrease hepatic catalase activity. All of these effects are observed at concentrations much higher than what is normally ingested by humans. The biological activities of garlic and its related compounds at lower concentrations that mimic human consumption remain to be studied further."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Cancer Research, College of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8020, USA. csyang@rci.rutgers.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chhabra", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03938", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES05693", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14180-63-3", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl sulfoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16841-48-8", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl sulfone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S395EDO61", "NameOfSubstance": "4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rodentia"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}], "NumberOfReferences": "71"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11238812", "10.1093/jn/131.3.1041S"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
