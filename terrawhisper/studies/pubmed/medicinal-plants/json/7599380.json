We therefore suggested that plants, in particular those belonging to the Allium group, that contain several active compounds with stable disulfide and thiol groups in their molecule may cause the same.", "To verify this hypothesis by investigating the in vitro acantholytic effect of three compounds of garlic.", "Skin samples from donors were cultured in the presence of three compounds of garlic (i.e. allylmercaptan, allylmethylsulfide and allylsulfide) for 3 days. The skin samples were then processed for microscopic control for acantholysis.", "Results indicate that, indeed, the three garlic compounds tested are capable of inducing acantholysis in vitro. Focal and diffuse acantholysis was observed in the specimens from 4 out of 7 donors cultured in the presence of 6 and 9 mM of each of the allyl compounds for 3 days. Interestingly, tissues from a DR4+ donor proved to be more acantholysis prone than others, showing large blistering due to diffuse acantholysis, thus indicating that individual susceptibility plays a crucial role also in vitro.", "Garlic compounds with stable disulfide and thiol groups in their molecule are capable of inducing acantholysis in vitro. These findings lend further support to the theory that 'harmless' nutritional factors are capable of inducing acantholysis in vitro and possibly also in vivo. In view of these findings, it is suggested that nutritional factors should be added to the ever-growing list of exogenous factors capable of inducing pemphigus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dermatology, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel."}], "LastName": "Brenner", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruocco", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wolf", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Angelis", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lombardi", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Dermatology", "NlmUniqueID": "9203244", "ISSNLinking": "1018-8665"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HLA-DR4 Antigen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OXW45UTR7B", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl methyl disulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acantholysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Blister"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "HLA-DR4 Antigen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pemphigus"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7599380", "10.1159/000246684"]}}]}
