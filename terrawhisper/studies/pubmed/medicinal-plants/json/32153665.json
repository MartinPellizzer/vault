The present study was focused on preliminary analysis of phytoconstituents and evaluation of anthelmintic property (in vitro) of different extracts of Cayratia auriculata (Family: Vitaceae) against earthworms (Pheretima posthuma). <b>Materials and methods:</b>Four different hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Cayratia auriculata were screened for their phytoconstituents. Cayratia auriculata has been shown to have various phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, phenolic compounds, tannins, alkaloids, saponins, glycosides and steroids. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of Cayratia auriculata were analyzed for their anthelmintic property on earthworms (Pheretima posthuma). Each extract at three different concentrations (20 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL and 80 mg/mL) was analysed to evaluate the time taken for paralysis (P) and death (D) of adult earthworms. Albendazole was used as standard and 2% Tween 80 in distilled water as control at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. <b>Results:</b>Our study found that the methanolic extract of Cayratia auriculata at a concentration of 80 mg/mL [21.98\u00b10.88 (P), 79.06\u00b10.87(D)] expressed a stronger anthelmintic property than the standard albendazole (10 mg/mL) [26.73\u00b10.56 (P), 87.70\u00b10.91 (D)]. <b>Conclusions:</b>All extracts expressed a dose dependent anthelmintic activity, with an increasing pattern in the following order: hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, GSL Medical College and General Hospital, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh-533296, India."}], "LastName": "Kancherla", "ForeName": "Nagaraju", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education &Research, Porur, Chennai-600116, India."}], "LastName": "Dhakshinamoothi", "ForeName": "Anusha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education & Research, Porur, Chennai-600116, India."}], "LastName": "Chitra", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, GSL Medical College and General Hospital, Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh-533296, India."}], "LastName": "Komaram", "ForeName": "Ravi Babu", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Editorial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Romania", "MedlineTA": "Maedica (Bucur)", "NlmUniqueID": "101526930", "ISSNLinking": "1841-9038"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Duraipandiyan V, Ayyanar M, Ignacimuthu S.
