In continuation of our research on the Greek <i>Stachys</i> species, the chemical profile of the aerial parts of cultivated <i>S. iva</i> Griseb. has been explored. The NMR profiles of the plant extract/infusion were used to guide the isolation process, leading to the targeted isolation of seventeen known compounds. The rare acylated flavonoid, stachysetin, was isolated for the third time from plant species in the international literature. Identification of the characteristic signals of stachysetin in the 1D <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of the crude extract was presented. In order to evaluate the potential of the identified chemical space in <i>Stachys</i> to bear possible bioactivity against diabetes, we performed an <i>in silico</i> screening against 17 proteins implicated in diabetes, as also ligand based similarity metrics against established anti-diabetic drugs. The results capitalized the anti-diabetic potency of stachysetin. Its binding profile to the major drug carrier plasma protein serum albumin was also explored along with its photophysical properties suggesting that stachysetin could be recognized and delivered in plasma through serum albumin and also could be tracked through near-infrared imaging.
