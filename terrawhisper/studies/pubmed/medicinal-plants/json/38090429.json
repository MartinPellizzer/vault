Coconut (<i>Cocos nucifera</i>), a common ingredient of Indian sub-continental cuisine, has been proven to possess various medicinal properties; similarly, wheatgrass (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is of greater medicinal value and is known as the powerhouse of nutrients and vitamins. These have been used individually, but there is limited data on the synergistic use of these products. Thus, the present in vitro study was designed to prepare an oral gel from the extract of\u00a0<i>C. nucifera</i> and\u00a0<i>T. aestivum</i>\u00a0and to assess its cumulative anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Materials and methods <i>C. nucifera</i> extract and <i>T. aestivum</i> extract were prepared separately, and gel formulation was done. The formulated gel was tested for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. Results The results of the present study demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory property of the gel formulation was greater as compared to the standard (diclofenac), with the highest percentage of inhibition of 90.1% at 50 \u03bcl. With regard to the antioxidant property, we found that it was comparable to the standard (ascorbic acid) at various concentrations, with greater activity at 50 \u03bcl. Conclusion The oral gel formulation of coconut (<i>C. nucifera</i>) and wheatgrass (<i>T. aestivum</i>) showed better anti-inflammatory and a comparable antioxidant activity. Thus, this formulation may be employed as an adjunct to the commercially available oral gel preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023, G et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "G", "ForeName": "Priyadharshini", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Pandiar", "ForeName": "Deepak", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Shanmugam", "ForeName": "Rajeshkumar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, IND."}], "LastName": "Poothakulath Krishnan", "ForeName": "Reshma", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "A historical overview of natural products in drug discovery.
