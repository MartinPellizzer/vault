Swingle (Simaroubaceae) is traditionally used to treat ascariasis, diarrhoea, spermatorrhoea, bleeding and gastrointestinal diseases. Objective The objective of this study is to investigate the antitumour activity and mechanism of 2-dihydroailanthone isolated from A. altissima. Materials and methods The U251 cells were treated with 1.00, 4.00 and 8.00\u2009\u03bcg/mL of 2-dihydroailanthone for 48\u2009h and the normal cells treated with 20.00\u2009\u03bcg/mL of 2-dihydroailanthone were tested as well. Proliferation inhibition of 2-dihydroailanthone on the cells was tested by MTT. Apoptosis and cell-cycle distribution in U251 cells with 1.00, 3.00 and 5.80\u2009\u03bcg/mL of 2-dihydroailanthone for 48\u2009h were determined by flow cytometry, respectively. The expression of the apoptosis-related genes and proteins was analysed by RT-PCR and Western blot method, respectively. Results MTT assay revealed that 2-dihydroailanthone inhibited U251 cells proliferation. The cell viability of U251 cells was 62.82, 31.34 and 25.58%, and that of three normal cells was 72.75, 82.74 and 44.92%, respectively. Flow cytometry assay showed that 2-dihydroailanthone induced apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cycle arrest towards U251 cells. The late apoptotic cells were 11.37, 21.73 and 33.83%, and the cells cycle distributed in the G0/G1 accounted for 48.85, 62.77 and 64.40%, respectively. The Western blot and RT-PCR assay showed that up-regulation of pro-apoptotic bax protein and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein as well as their mRNA on U251 cells might be related to the apoptosis induction and proliferation inhibition. Conclusion An important bioactive component, 2-dihydroailanthone, has antitumour effects, enlightening a novel source of phytomedicines in tumour therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
