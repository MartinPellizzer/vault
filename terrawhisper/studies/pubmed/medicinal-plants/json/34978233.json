Glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), prostaglandin (PGE2) and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) alongside with histopathological examination of gastric mucosa were analysed.

AS-EO alleviated the histological and pathological damage of gastric tissue caused by ethanol. Metabolites profiling revealed an increase in uracil, cholesterol and fatty acids/fatty acyl amides levels in ulcer rats and restored to normal levels post AS-EO intervention. These results indicated the efficacy of AS-EO in a dose-dependent manner, and to exert protective effects in ulcer rat model by targeting several metabolic pathways viz. lipid, energy, and nucleotide metabolisms.", "AS-EO adds to the known uses of genus <i>Artemisia</i> as anti-ulcerogenic agent by attenuating oxidative stress and inflammatory responses associated with an ulcer.
