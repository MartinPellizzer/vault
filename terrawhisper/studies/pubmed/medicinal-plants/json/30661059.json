Dietary supplements and various herbs have reported valuable effects on migraine. Aim The present study systematically review the effects of these dietary supplements and herbs on migraine. Methods The literature search was done on electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar and Science direct (2005-2015). The quality of articles was assessed through a criteria list of methodological quality assessment of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The papers got C50 points considered to be of good quality methodology. The maximum score was 100. Results Fourteen RCTs on migraine were included in this review. The range of quality score varied from 37 to 65 points. Conclusion Various RCTs suggested that dietary and vitamin supplementation and different herbs might be effective in treatment of migraine. Evaluated RCTs have various methodological shortcomings. So, a firm conclusion can't be made for the efficacy of dietary supplementation and herbs in the treatment of migraine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Tayyeba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quaid- e- Azam medical college Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Fatima", "ForeName": "Qindeel", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Migraine Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30661059", "10.1515/jcim-2018-0143", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2018-0143/jcim-2018-0143.xml"]}}]}
