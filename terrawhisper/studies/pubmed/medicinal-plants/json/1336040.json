Narciclasine [1], lycoricidine [2], pancratistatin [4], 7-deoxypancratistatin [5], and acetates 6-8, isonarciclasine [13a], cis-dihydronarciclasine [14a], trans-dihydronarciclasine [15a], their 7-deoxy analogues 13b-15b, lycorines 16 and 17, and pretazettine [18] exhibited consistent in vitro activity against all three flaviviruses and against the bunyaviruses, Punta Toro and Rift Valley fever virus. Activity against sandfly fever virus was only observed with 7-deoxy analogues. In most cases, however, selectivity of the active compounds was low, with toxicity in uninfected cells (TC50) occurring at concentrations within 10-fold that of the viral inhibitory concentrations (IC50). No activity was observed against human immunodeficiency virus-type 1, Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus, or vaccinia viruses. Pancratistatin [4] and its 7-deoxy analogue 5 were evaluated in two murine Japanese encephalitis mouse models (differing in viral dose challenge, among other factors). In two experiments (low LD50 viral challenge, variant I), prophylactic administration of 4 at 4 and 6 mg/kg/day (2% EtOH/saline, sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 100% and 90%, respectively. In the same model, prophylactic administration of 5 at 40 mg/kg/day in hydroxypropylcellulose (sc, once daily for 7 days, day -1 to +5) increased survival of Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mice to 80%. In a second variant (high LD50 viral challenge), administration of 4 at 6 mg/kg/day (ip, twice daily for 9 days, day -1 to +7) resulted in a 50% survival rate. In all cases, there was no survival in the diluent-treated control mice. Thus, 4 and 5 demonstrated activity in mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus but only at near toxic concentrations. To our knowledge, however, this represents a rare demonstration of chemotherapeutic efficacy (by a substance other than an interferon inducer) in a Japanese-encephalitis-virus-infected mouse model."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fort Detrick, Frederick, Maryland 21702."}], "LastName": "Gabrielsen", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Monath", "ForeName": "T P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Huggins", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kefauver", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pettit", "ForeName": "G R", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Groszek", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hollingshead", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kirsi", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shannon", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schubert", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Encephalitis, Japanese"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "RNA Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Plaque Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1336040", "10.1021/np50089a003"]}}]}
