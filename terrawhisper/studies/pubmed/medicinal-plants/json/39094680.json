Goats typically respond less well to anthelminthic treatments, which may increase their resistance to nematodes. For this purpose, the anthelmintic effect of Pelargonium quercetorum Agnew (P. quercetorum) extract was tested in an in vivo study against gastrointestinal parasites of goats. A total of 40 goats naturally infected with mixed gastrointestinal nematode species were divided into four groups: the first group was treated with albendazole (7.5\u00a0mg/kg), the second group received a single dose of closantel (7.5\u00a0mg/kg), the third group received plant extract (7.5\u00a0mg/kg), and the fourth group served as an untreated control. Fecal egg counts (FEC) were carried out on day 14, as well as day 0, which was prior to the first treatment dose. According to the results, maximum reduction in FEC percentage was observed in P. quercetorum treated group (63.41%). Furthermore, nematode parasites responded poorly to synthetic drugs, although there was a 4.72% and 45.54% decrease in FEC in the albendazole and closantel-treated groups, respectively. Although no significant difference was found between the treatment groups, the P. quercetorum treated group showed a significant reduction in fecal egg count after treatment. Based on findings, a P. quercetorum based anthelmintic could be a sustainable alternative to combat parasite infestation. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose rate and frequency of doses required for effective control of gastrointestinal parasites in goats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
