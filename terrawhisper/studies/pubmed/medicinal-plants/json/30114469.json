Don) Benn. have been proven to possess inhibitory activity against various cancer cells. However, their effect on hepatocellular carcinoma and structure-activity relationships (SAR) have not been systematically reported. In this work, bioactivity-directed fractionation of P. quassioides led to the separation of active fraction A2-2. A total of 39 \u03b2-carbolines, including 4 new ones (1-4), were obtained from the active fraction. Moreover, all the isolated compounds were identified in the active fraction A2-2 by LC-MS. The cytotoxicity on HepG2 and Hep3B cells of all compounds was screened by MTT assay, and the SAR were established. The SAR were also supported by the apoptosis ratio of HepG2 cells using flow cytometry analysis after treatment with potential compounds 1, 2, 9, 10, 12, 29, 36 and 38. It suggested that these active compounds caused death of hepatoma cells through apoptosis induction. In addition, further study revealed that compounds 12, 29, 36 significantly activated caspase-3 in HepG2 cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
