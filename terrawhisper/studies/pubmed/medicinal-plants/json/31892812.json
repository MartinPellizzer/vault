The purpose of this study was to predict deleterious/damaging SNPs in the <i>APAF1</i> gene viain silicoanalysis. To this end, <i>APAF1</i> missense SNPs were obtained from the NCBI dbSNP database<i>.</i> In silico analysis of the missense SNPs was carried out by using publicly available online software tools. The stabilization and three-dimensional modeling of mutant proteins were also determined by using the I-Mutant 2.0 and Project HOPE webservers, respectively. In total, 772 missense SNPs were found in the <i>APAF1</i> gene from the NCBI dbSNP database, 18 SNPs of which were demonstrated to be deleterious or damaging. Of those, 13 SNPs had a decreasing effect on protein stability, while the other 5 SNPs had an increasing effect. Based on the modeling results, some dissimilarities of mutant type amino acids from wild-type amino acids such as size, charge, and hydrophobicity were revealed. The SNPs predicted to be deleterious in this study might be used in the selection of target SNPs for genotyping in disease association studies. Therefore, we could suggest that the present study could pave the way for future experimental studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5885-0193"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Vocational School of Health Services, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar University, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kaman", "ForeName": "Tu\u011fba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7803-3249"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Techniques, Vocational School of Health Services, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar University, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karasakal", "ForeName": "\u00d6mer Faruk", "Initials": "\u00d6F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0395-9845"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Technology, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar University, Vocational School of Health Services, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00d6zkan Oktay", "ForeName": "Ebru", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1304-9386"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar University, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Dentistry, Basic Medical Sciences, Marmara University, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ulucan", "ForeName": "Korkut", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6651-718X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, \u00dcsk\u00fcdar University, \u0130stanbul Turkey."}], "LastName": "Konuk", "ForeName": "Muhsin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Turkey", "MedlineTA": "Turk J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9434434", "ISSNLinking": "1300-0152"}, "CoiStatement": "CONFLICT OF INTEREST: none declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "AbdulAzeez S Borgio JF In-silico computing of the most deleterious nsSNPs in HBA1 gene.
