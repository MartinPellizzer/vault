Here we want to elucidate the effects and mechanism of Phoma herbarum D603 on the root development and tanshinone synthesis in root of Salvia miltiorrhiza by endophyte-plant coculture system. The mycelium of P. herbarum D603 was colonized in the root tissue space, and formed a stable symbiotic relationship with host plant. The in vitro activities analysis showed that the concentration of IAA produced by D603 can reach(6.45\u00b10.23) \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1), and this strain had some abilities of phosphorus solubilization and siderophore production activities. The coculture experiment showed that strain D603 can significantly promote the synthesis and accumulation of tanshinones in the root of S. miltiorrhiza, in which after 8 weeks of treatment with D603, the content of tanshinone \u2161_A in the roots reached up to(1.42\u00b10.59) mg\u00b7g~(-1). By the qRT-PCR analysis results, we found that D603 could improve the expression levels of some key genes(DXR, DXS, GGPP, HMGR, CPS) of tanshinone biosynthesis pathway in host plant S. miltiorrhiza, but the promoting effect mainly occurred in the early stage of the interaction, and the enzyme activity level decreased in varying degrees of the later stage. In summary, seed-associated endophyte P. herbarum D603 can promote the growth and root development of S. miltiorrhiza by producing hormones, promoting nutrient absorption and siderophore production, and promote the synthesis and accumulation of tanshinones by regulating the expression level of key genes in the synthetic pathway in S. miltiorrhiza."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University Yangling 712100, China Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hai-Min", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Hong-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yi", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hai-Hua", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University Yangling 712100, China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University Yangling 712100, China Key Laboratory of Plant Secondary Metabolism and Regulation of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences and Medicine, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University Hangzhou 310018, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Zong-Suo", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03UUH3J385", "NameOfSubstance": "tanshinone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237412", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191113.101"]}}]}
