The mechanisms involved in toxic action of pyrrolizidine alkaloids need further investigation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the correlation of RTS hepatotoxicity with hepatic RTS concentration and pyrrole-protein adduction. Mice were intragastrically treated with RTS alone or RTS and ketoconazole (KTZ) simultaneously. Sera and liver tissues were collected at various time points after administration, followed by the determination of changes in serum transaminase activity, hepatic RTS concentration and pyrrole-protein adduction. The correlation of RTS hepatotoxicity with hepatic RTS concentration and hepatic pyrrole-protein adduction were examined by use of Sigmoid-Emax PK/PD models. Dose-dependent hepatotoxicity, hepatic RTS concentration and pyrrole-protein adduction were observed in the animals, which could be modulated by co-treatment with KTZ. The fit parameters indicated pyrrole-protein adduction was more closely related with liver injury than hepatic RTS concentration. Similar correlation was observed in mice given low-dose of RTS for 4 consecutive days. RTS hepatotoxicity is correlated with hepatic pyrrole-protein adduction derived from RTS rather than hepatic RTS concentration. The observed protein modification would be a good indicator to predict the hepatoxicity of RTS at low dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
