Their structures were established by a combination of extensive NMR spectroscopic analysis, HR-ESIMS data, and ECD calculations. The anti-leukemia activities of all compounds towards three cell lines (HEL, KG-1a, and K562) were evaluated in vitro. Compounds 1-3 exhibited moderate cytotoxicity with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.59 to 5.47 \u03bcmol\u00b7L<sup>-1</sup>. Mechanistic studies indicated that 2 induced apoptosis by decreasing anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and activating the caspase family in K562 cells. These results suggest that compound 2 is a potential anti-leukemia agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 China Pharmaceutical University. Published by Elsevier B.V.
