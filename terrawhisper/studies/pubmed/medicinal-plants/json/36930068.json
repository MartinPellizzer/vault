Considerable research on insomnia has been conducted in modern medicine in recent years and encouraging results have been achieved in the fields of genetics and neurobiology. Unfortunately, however, the pathogenesis of insomnia remains elusive to modern medicine, and pharmacological treatment of insomnia has been regarded as conventional. However, in the course of treatment, pharmacological treatment itself is increasingly being questioned due to potential dependence and drug resistance and is now being replaced by cognitive behavior therapy as the first-line treatment. As an important component of complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, especially non-pharmacological treatment methods such as acupuncture, is gaining increasing attention worldwide. In this article, we discuss the combination of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and medicine to treat insomnia based on neurobiology in the context of modern medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 the Author(s).
