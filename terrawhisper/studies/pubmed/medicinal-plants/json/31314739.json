Materials and methods A total of 40 fats were divided into four groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 served as the control group, and the rest were assigned increasing daily oral administration of the extract for 28 days. At the end of treatment, blood was collected for hematological and osmotic fragility studies. The free radical scavenging effect of the extract was investigated via different in vitro models as well. Results Results showed that the nitric oxide scavenging and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activities of the extract were significant (p < 0.05) and compared favorably with that of vitamin C. At 200 and 400 \u03bcg/mL, the nitric oxide scavenging activities for Ajumbise Polyherbal Extract (APE) were 60.71 \u00b1 0.25% and 59.49 \u00b1 0.98%, respectively, whereas for the same concentrations of vitamin C, 74.60 \u00b1 0.25% and 85.24 \u00b1 0.14 scavenging activities were obtained. The (DPPH) activity at 100 \u03bcg/mL was 81.24 \u00b1 0.02% for the extract and 96.22 \u00b1 0.18% for vitamin C. However, at all concentrations, the extract had significantly lower Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) activity than vitamin C. Red blood cell counts (RBCC), hemoglobin and packed cell volume values (PCV) were significantly lowered only in groups treated with 400 and 800 mg/kg of the extract (p < 0.05), whereas other RBCC parameters and white blood cell counts (WBCC) were not significantly affected (p < 0.05). Platelet (PLT) count was also significantly lowered in all extract-treated groups. The extract also significantly reduced RBCC percentage hemolysis (p < 0.05). Conclusions Ajumbise polyherbal may be free of hematoxicity and may improve the integrity of the RBC membrane due to its appreciable antioxidant activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Abia State University, Uturu, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ijioma", "ForeName": "Solomon Nnah", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Calabar, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of medicine, Cross River State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Osim", "ForeName": "Eme Eme", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Abia State University, Uturu, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nwankwo", "ForeName": "Azubuike A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nwosu", "ForeName": "Chinwe O", "Initials": "CO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Calabar, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of medicine, Cross River State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ekeleme", "ForeName": "Chinedum Martins", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Hematology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osmotic Fragility"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ijioma SN, Okafor AI, Ndukuba PI, Akomas SC.
