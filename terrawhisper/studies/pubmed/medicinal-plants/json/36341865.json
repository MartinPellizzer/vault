In recent times, studies have focused on medicinal plants such as ginger due to its multifaceted characteristics compared to conventional medicine. 6-Shogaol is regarded as the main active compound of ginger participating in pharmacological activities and combating various health disorders, especially cancer. In our study, we compared the effects of 6-gingerol, 6-paradol, and 6-shogaol on Ishikawa cells, and found 6-shogaol as a more effective ingredient against Ishikawa cell proliferation. Moreover, its promoted ferroptosis, as a result, triggered mitochondrial morphologic alternation, as well as changed iron concentration, GSH and MDA levels. Furthermore, 6-Shogaol inhibited cell metastasis by influencing cell invasion and migration. Finally, 6-shogaol could trigger PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo confirmed by western blotting assay and immunohistochemical evaluation. These findings suggest that 6-shogaol can be used as promising functional food component in health diet and in drug target methods for endometrial cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
