The hairy roots formed callus with green nodular protuberances when transferred onto agar-gelled MS medium containing 3.0mg/l zeatin. These meristematic zones developed into shoot buds on medium with 1.0mg/l 2, 4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 40mg/l ascorbic acid. These shoot buds subsequently formed rooted plants when shifted onto a hormone-free MS medium with 6% sucrose. Transgenic nature of the plants was confirmed by the presence of rol genes of the Ri plasmid in them. The transgenic plants (TP) had elongated internodes and a highly proliferating root system. During glass house cultivation TP consistently exhibited slower growth rate, low chlorophyll content (1.02\u00b10.08mg/gm fr. wt.), reduced carbon exchange rate (2.67\u00b10.16\u03bcmolm<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), less transpiration rate (2.30\u00b10.20mmolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and poor stomatal conductance (2.21\u00b10.04mmolm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) when compared with non-transgenic population. The activity of rubisco enzyme in the leaves of TP was nearly two folds less in comparison to non-transgenic controls (1.80milliunitsml<sup>-1</sup>mgprotein<sup>-1</sup> against 3.61milliunits ml<sup>-1</sup>mgprotein<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). Anatomically, the TP had a distinct tetarch arrangement of vascular bundles in their stem and roots against a typical ployarched pattern in the non-transgenic plants. Significantly, the transgenic plants accumulated 35% higher amount of total TIAs (3.10\u00b10.21% dry wt.) along with a 0.03% dry wt. content of its vasodilatory and nootropic alkaloid vincamine in their leaves. Higher productivity of alkaloids in TP was corroborated with more than four (RQ=4.60\u00b10.30) and five (RQ=5.20\u00b10.70) times over-expression of TIAs pathway genes tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC) and strictosidine synthase (STR) that are responsible for pushing the metabolic flux towards TIAs synthesis in this medicinal herb."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
