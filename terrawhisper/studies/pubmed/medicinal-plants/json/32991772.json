For accurate quality control and bioactivity assessment of Sphaerophysa salsula, a rapid and productive method to isolate flavonoid glycosides is needed. Therefore, this work reports the development of a novel comprehensive strategy based on an online middle-pressure chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography for rapid enrichment and separation of flavonoid glycosides from S. salsula. First, the flavonoid glycosides were enriched using an online middle-pressure chromatographic column containing stationary middle chromatogram isolated phase. During this process, the high-volume injection of the extracting solution was realized by an empty precolumn positioned before the main chromatographic tower. Then, the compounds were separated through preparative high-performance liquid chromatography with Megress C18. As a result,\u00a0one new flavonol 3-O-glycoside (2) and two known flavonol 3-O-glycosides (1, 3) were targetedly isolated from S. salsula. The content of compounds 1-3 in S. salsula was 0.09, 0.11, and 0.18\u00a0wt%, respectively. Comparing to traditional enrichment and separation methods, our technique offers significantly shorter sample pretreatment time as well as high reproducibility. We believe that our separation method has a strong potential to be used for the processing of other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tibetan Medicine Research, Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xining, P.
