Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of garlic oil (500 mg/kg i.p.) showed a significant depression of hepatic cytochrome P-450, aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase while microsomal protein content, cytochrome b5, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, benzphetamine N-demethylase and cytosolic glutathione, S-transferase remained unaffected 24 h following the treatment. Although certain microsomal enzymes were depressed, there was no liver damage caused by garlic oil as judged by the putative serum enzyme test. On the other hand, daily administration of garlic oil (50 mg/kg i.p. for 5 days) produced a significant increase in hepatic cytochrome P-450, aminopyrine N-demethylase and benzphetamine N-demethylase activities, but not in the rest of the aforementioned parameters of biotransformation reactions. These data indicate that the effect of garlic oil on the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme system is dose-dependent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, Tuskegee University, AL 36088."}], "LastName": "Dalvi", "ForeName": "R R", "Initials": "RR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1G12 RR03059-01", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7709027", "ISSNLinking": "0378-4274"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome b Group"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.2.4", "NameOfSubstance": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome b Group"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inactivation, Metabolic"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1595088", "10.1016/0378-4274(92)90288-u", "0378-4274(92)90288-U"]}}]}
