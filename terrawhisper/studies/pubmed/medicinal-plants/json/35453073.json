ROR\u03b3t, a specific transcription factor regulating Th17 cell differentiation, is a pivotal target for the treatment of diseases. However, the clinical application of ROR\u03b3t inverse agonists reported so far has been hindered due to limited efficacy and toxic side effects. Plant-derived natural products with drug-like properties and safety are wide and valuable resources for candidate drug discovery. Herein, structure-based virtual screening was used to find out 2',4'-Dihydroxy-2,3-dimethoxychalcone (DDC), a chalcone derivative rich in plants and food, located in the binding pocket of ROR\u03b3t and targeted to inhibit ROR\u03b3t activity. DDC repressed murine Th17 differentiation and promoted Treg differentiation remarkably in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, DDC treatment improved experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis recovery, ameliorated experimental colitis severity, and prevented graft rejection significantly. Mechanically, DDC indirectly stabilized Foxp3 expression by inhibiting ROR\u03b3t activity and the expression of its target gene profile in vitro and in vivo, which realized its regulation of Th17/Treg balance. In conclusion, our study provides a scientific basis that DDC, as an inverse agonist of ROR\u03b3t with simple structure, rich sources, low cost, high efficiency, and low toxicity, has great potential for the development of a novel effective immunomodulator for the treatment of Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
