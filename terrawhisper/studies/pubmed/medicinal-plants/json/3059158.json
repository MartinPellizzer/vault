The majority of these alkaloids are hepatotoxic in both animals and humans, and some have been shown to induce tumours in experimental animals. In this article, the toxic properties of pyrrolizidine alkaloids are reviewed briefly, with particular reference to their presence in comfrey. The acute and long-term health risks at the normally-low levels of comfrey consumption are evaluated and discussed. On the basis of the data that are available currently, the small but significant long-term risk that is associated with the consumption of comfrey justifies the need to limit its intake. This is being achieved by controls under various state Poisons Acts, but also requires further education on the potential dangers of naturally-occurring chemicals of plant origin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology Unit, Department of Community Services and Health, Canberra, ACT."}], "LastName": "Abbott", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Med J Aust", "NlmUniqueID": "0400714", "ISSNLinking": "0025-729X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "344S277G0Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Allantoin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Allantoin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}], "NumberOfReferences": "29"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3059158", "10.5694/j.1326-5377.1988.tb120821.x"]}}]}
