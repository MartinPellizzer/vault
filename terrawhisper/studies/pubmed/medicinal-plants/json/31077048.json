This study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effects of Allium hirtifolium Boiss bulbs against Cd-induced renal failure in rats. Thirty-six rats were divided into 6 groups: group 1, 2, and 3 received vehicle, Cd (100 mg/L/day by drinking water), and AhB extract (200 mg/kg/day; orally), respectively. Groups 4, 5, and 6 were Cd groups which treated AhB extract (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day, respectively). After 2 weeks, renal function and oxidative stress markers were determined by using colorimetric methods. Our findings showed that Cd caused a significant increase in creatinine (Cr; p<0.05), uric acid (p<0.01), BUN (p<0.05), serum levels, lipid peroxidation (LPO; p<0.01), and nitric oxide (NO; p<0.01); the depletion of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC; p<0.01) and total thiol molecules (TTM; p<0.001); and structural alterations in the renal tissue. Following AhB extract administration, a remarkable improvement was observed in the functional and oxidative stress markers of renal tissue.This study suggests that AhB may prevent progression of Cd-induced renal failure via improvement of oxidative/antioxidant balance in renal tissue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Dara", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, P.O.
