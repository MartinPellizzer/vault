The extraction system consisted of acetonitrile/water (90:10, v/v) in a bottle with stirring for 30 min. Both Soxhlet and bottle-stirring extractions were studied. Samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with a Cosmosil C18-AR column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 microm, 120 A). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/water (55:45, v/v) with a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and UV detection at 210 nm. Analysis time was 6 min, with a detection limit of 0.10 ng on column. The calibration curve was linear over a range of 0.160-850 microg/mL parthenolide with R(2) = 0.9999. Replicate tests indicated good reproducibility of the method with an RSD% = 0.88 (n = 10). Spike recovery of parthenolide was found to be 99.3% with an RSD% = 1.6 (n = 6)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Research and Development, Nature's Sunshine Products, Inc., 1655 North Main Street, Spanish Fork, Utah 84660, USA.
