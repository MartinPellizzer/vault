Although rich in flavonoids, the ethnopharmacological uses of this plant do not include atherosclerosis prevention. Furthermore, no study had been conducted so far exploring the antioxidant activity of Achyrocline satureoides vis-\u00e0-vis human LDL oxidation, which is the compelling issue in pinpointing potential cardioprotective new uses for a traditional remedy. We explored the effects of AS extracts on human LDL oxidation, employing 3 different systems which are thought to play a role in oxidation of LDL in the arterial wall: copper, peroxynitrite, and lipoxygenase. Oxidation was monitored by conjugate dienes, TBARS formation and aggregation of apoB using SDS-PAGE. In copper-initiated oxidation a dose dependent inhibition of the initiation and propagation of lipid oxidation is shown by an increase in the lag phase for conjugate diene production which was 60 +/- 15 min in the absence and 120 +/- 20 min in the presence of 4 microg/ml AS extracts (p < 0.001). TBARS production was reduced by 95% after 3 h incubation at 5 microg/ml. Aggregation of apoB was abolished at the same concentrations. SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine) produces peroxynitrite via generation of NO and O2-. When LDL was incubated in its presence, a milder oxidation was observed as compared with Cu2+, and AS produced over 70% inhibition. Finally, we show a striking dose-dependent inhibitory effect of lipoxygenase conjugate diene production, which is over 95% at AS concentrations of 5 microg/ml. When compared with other antioxidants, AS effect is greater but in the same order of magnitude than that of ascorbic acid and similar to the popular herbal tea Ilex paraguariensis. In all three systems employed an effect is already substantiated at a concentration of the AS extract of 4 microg/ml, which corresponds to a 1/100 dilution of the preparations usually drunk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Laboratory, Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Mare Island Building H-83, 832 Walnut Ave., Vallejo, CA, USA. agugliuc@touro.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gugliucci", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Menini", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "oxidized low density lipoprotein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12072157", "10.1016/s0024-3205(02)01734-4", "S0024320502017344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
