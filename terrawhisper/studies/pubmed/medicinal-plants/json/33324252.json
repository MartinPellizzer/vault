The number of kratom users outside of Southeast Asia has increased significantly in recent decades with use spreading to the Unites States (US) and Europe. Because of its reputed opioid-like psychoactive effects at higher doses, kratom has been regulated in several countries and is subject to an import ban by the US Food and Drug Administration. Nonetheless, in the US it is estimated that 10-15 million people consume kratom primarily for the self-treatment of pain, psychiatric disorders, to mitigate withdrawal from or dependence on opioids, and to self-treat opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders (SUDs). Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage in the supply of kratom products may place unexpected burdens on kratom users, potentially influencing some who use kratom for SUD self-treatment to regress to harmful drug use, hence increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes, including overdose. Inadequate treatment, treatment barriers, and increases in the sales of adulterated kratom products on the internet or in convenience stores could exacerbate circumstances further. Although there are currently no verified indications of kratom scarcity, researchers and clinicians should be aware of and remain vigilant to this unanticipated possibility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Singh, Brown, Cinosi, Corazza, Henningfield, Garcia-Romeu, McCurdy, McMahon, Prozialeck, Smith, Swogger, Veltri, Walsh and Grundmann."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Drug Research, University Sains Malaysia, George Town, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Darshan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Applied Research and Innovation, British Columbia Institute of Technology, Burnaby, BC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "Paula N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, United Kingdom."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hertfordshire Partnership National Health Service University Foundation Trust, St Albans, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Cinosi", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Corazza", "ForeName": "Ornella", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pinney Associates, Bethesda, MD, United States."}], "LastName": "Henningfield", "ForeName": "Jack E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States."}], "LastName": "Garcia-Romeu", "ForeName": "Albert", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Florida, FL, United States."}], "LastName": "McCurdy", "ForeName": "Christopher R", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Florida, FL, United States."}], "LastName": "McMahon", "ForeName": "Lance R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Graduate Studies, Midwestern University, Downers Grove, IL, United States."}], "LastName": "Prozialeck", "ForeName": "Walter C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute on Drug Abuse Intramural Research Program, Baltimore, MD, United States."}], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "Kirsten E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States."}], "LastName": "Swogger", "ForeName": "Marc T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Midwestern University, Glendale, AZ, United States."}], "LastName": "Veltri", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada."}], "LastName": "Walsh", "ForeName": "Zach", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Florida, FL, United States."}], "LastName": "Grundmann", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Psychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "101545006", "ISSNLinking": "1664-0640"}, "CoiStatement": "JH is an employee of Pinney Associates which provides consulting services on the development and regulation of pharmaceuticals, cannabinoids, and dietary supplements including kratom and advises the American Kratom Association on Kratom science.
