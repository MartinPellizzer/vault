The proximate composition of the individual seeds and the formulations were determined. The composite flour blend containing the highest quantity of fluted pumkin seeds was found to have the highest protein and fat contents (24 and 8% respectively). Functional properties of formulated weaning foods were evaluated. The effect of fermentation on the nutritional quality of the products were determined by animal feeding experiments. The feed intake, weight gain and PER values were evaluated. Fermentation was found to improve the nutritional quality of the formulations. The fermented composite mixture of millet, bambarra groundnut and fluted pumpkin flour (1:1:2) was found to have the highest PER value of 2.1. This suggests that this fermented product will support growth in children better than other formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Imo State University, Okigwe, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ezeji", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ojimelukwe", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Int J Food Microbiol. 1991 Feb;12(2-3):217-24", "ArticleIdList": ["2049286"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8295867", "10.1007/BF01088322"]}}]}
