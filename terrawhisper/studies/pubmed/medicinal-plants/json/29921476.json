The mimics of acyl lysine have been approved to be a very efficient strategy for development of mechanism-based sirtuin inhibitors. In current study, a novel scaffold of l-S-(3-carboxamidopropyl) cysteine (l-CAPC) has been exploited for design and synthesis of sirtuin inhibitors. As a result, the mimics of N<sup>\u03b5</sup>-acyl-lysine derived from cysteine including small molecules (5a-m) and peptides (9a-m) have been synthesized. Among these, the peptides 9g and 9h were found to be the most inhibitory potency and selectivity against SIRT2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
