In these respects the clastogenic effect of Cpt resembles that of agents that act by an S-phase-dependent mechanism. In contrast to typical S-phase-dependent agents, Cpt produced lesions capable of giving rise to aberrations only in S-phase cells that were synthesizing DNA at the time of treatment. The dependence on ongoing DNA synthesis was suggested in autoradiographic experiments and by the fact that the clastogenic effect of Cpt was strongly suppressed by hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. After Cpt treatments, there were many more cells with 3-12 aberrations and far fewer cells with 0, 1 or 2 aberrations than expected on the basis of a Poisson distribution. Cpt further differed from typical S-phase-dependent agents by being capable of inducing lesions in the G2 phase that give rise to chromosomal aberrations in the first mitosis after treatment. This effect was obtained at Cpt concentrations around 10 microM, whereas only 0.03 microM Cpt was required to produce chromatid aberrations in the S phase. Results of G2-phase experiments with Cpt and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, suggest that DNA synthesis is required for the clastogenic effect of Cpt not only during the S phase, but also during the G2 phase, although the DNA syntheses involved are both quantitatively and qualitatively different."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Uppsala University, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kihlman", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "XT3Z54Z28A", "NameOfSubstance": "Camptothecin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camptothecin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Interphase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1379322", "10.1016/0027-5107(92)90222-n", "0027-5107(92)90222-N"]}}]}
