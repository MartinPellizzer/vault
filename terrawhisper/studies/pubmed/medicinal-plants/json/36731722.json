However, estrogen-based therapy may potentially increase the risk of breast cancer, necessitating a search for novel drugs. This study, therefore, investigated the ameliorative effects of a selective estrogen receptor modulator, ormeloxifene, in pulmonary hypertension.", "Cardiomyocytes (H9C2) and human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) for 42 and 96\u00a0h, respectively, with or without ormeloxifene pre-treatment (1 \u03bcM). Also, female (ovary-intact or ovariectomized) and male Sprague-Dawley rats received monocrotaline (60\u00a0mg/kg, once, subcutaneously), with or without ormeloxifene treatment (2.5\u00a0mg/kg, orally) for four weeks.", "Hypoxia dysregulated 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2HSD) 1 & 2 expressions, reducing 17\u03b2-estradiol production and estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2 in HPASMC but increasing estrone, proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Similarly, monocrotaline decreased plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol and uterine weight in ovary-intact rats. Further, monocrotaline altered 17\u03b2HSD1 & 2 expressions and reduced estrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, increasing right ventricular pressure, proliferation, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and vascular remodeling in female and male rats, with worsened conditions in ovariectomized rats. Ormeloxifene was less uterotrophic; however, it attenuated both hypoxia and monocrotaline effects by improving pulmonary 17\u03b2-estradiol synthesis. Furthermore, ormeloxifene decreased cardiac hypertrophy and right ventricular remodeling induced by hypoxia and monocrotaline.", "This study demonstrates that ormeloxifene promoted pulmonary 17\u03b2-estradiol synthesis, alleviated inflammation, improved the NOX4/HO1/Nrf/PPAR\u03b3/PGC-1\u03b1 axis, and attenuated pulmonary hypertension. It is evidently safe at tested concentrations and may be effectively repurposed for pulmonary hypertension treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
