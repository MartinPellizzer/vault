Their planar structures were elucidated by 1D, 2D NMR experiments and high resolution mass spectrometry, and the absolute configurations were determined by NOE experiments, electronic circular dichroism, and specific rotation. Seven isoquinolines exhibited stronger hepatoprotective activities than that of positive control in D-galactosamine induced L02\u202fcells damage model, which could be served as the leading compounds for further investigations. The primary structure-activity relationship was also summarized accordingly."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
