Phytomedicinal therapy is a benchmark for malaria in the Himalayan region. As the dialect and traditional variations have been seen along with this, usage of medicinal plant, its portion (shoot and root system) and mode of preparation also varies. There is no scientific evidence available for illustrating the antiplasmodial activity of the rhizomes of Bergenia ciliata (Saxifragaceae), which is known to be an antipyretic (fever akin to malaria), hepato-protective, and also for spleen enlargement.", "The present study evaluates the antimalarial activity of ethanol extract of B. ciliata rhizomes (EREBC).", "HPTLC was performed to identify and quantify three marker compounds in EREBC. The in vitro antimalarial activity was evaluated by schizont maturation inhibition assay. MTT assay was employed to test the cytotoxicity of EREBC. Peter's 4-day test and Peters method was employed to discern the suppressive and preventive activity of the extract respectively.", "HPTLC analysis revealed the presence of bergenin, epicatechin and gallic acid in the extract. EREBC exhibited considerable inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) of schizont maturation of both RKL-9 and MRC-2 strains of P. falciparum. EREBC was non-toxic to both HeLa cells and normal dermal fibroblasts (CC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0>\u00a01000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The selectivity index was > 200 for both strains. Acute toxicity of EREBC was > 4\u00a0g/kg. EREBC exhibited considerable in vivo suppressive activity with 96.48% inhibition at 500\u00a0mg/kg in comparison to chloroquine (96.08%). The ED<sub>50</sub> of the extract was < 50\u00a0mg/kg. No mortality was evident in mice administered with different doses of EREBC (50-500\u00a0mg/kg) throughout the follow up period of 28 days. EREBC exhibited safety to liver and kidney function of mice as observed from biochemical analysis.", "Overall, the study illustrates the marked efficacy and potential of EREBC as an antimalarial agent with bergenin, epicatechin and gallic acid its major constituents, which played a pivotal role in the generation of the immune response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
