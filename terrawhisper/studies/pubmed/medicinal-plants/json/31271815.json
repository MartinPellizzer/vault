It seems that the phospholipid content of liposomes can act as immunostimulatory molecules in cancer immunotherapy. In the present study, the immunological properties of different phospholipid content of liposomal antigen delivery platforms were investigated. To this aim, F1 to F4 na\u00efve liposomes (without tumor-specific loaded antigens) of positively charged DOTAP/Cholesterol/DOPE (4/4/4\u202fmol ratio), negatively charged DMPC/DMPG/Cholesterol/DOPE (15/2/3/5), negatively charged DSPC/DSPG/Cholesterol/DOPE (15/2/3/5) and PEGylated HSPC/mPEG2000-DSPE/Cholesterol (13/110) liposomal compositions were administered in mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma to assess tumor therapy. Moreover, In-vitro studies were conducted, including cytotoxicity assay, serum cytokines measurements, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 ELISpot assay, T cells subpopulation frequencies assay. The liposomes containing DOTAP and DOPE (F1 liposomes) were able to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes signals such as IFN-\u03b3 secretions. In parallel, the aforementioned phospholipids stimulated secretion of IL-4 and IL-17 cytokines from T helper cells. However, these liposomes did not improve survival indices in mice. As conclusion, DOTAP and DOPE contained liposomes (F1 liposomes) stimulate a mixture of Th1 and Th2 immune responses in a tumor-specific antigens-free manner in mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma. Therefore, phospholipid composition of liposomes merits consideration in designing antigen-containing liposomes for cancer immunotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
