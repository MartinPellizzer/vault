The traditional Chinese medicine has attracted considerable attention because of its low toxicity. This study was to explore the inhibitory effects of Scutellaria barbatae D. Don, a kind of traditional Chinese medicinal anti-cancer herb, on tumor angiogenesis, and investigate its mechanism.", "Matrigel plug and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to construct in vivo and in vitro models of angiogenesis to assess the effect of Scutellaria barbatae D. Don on angiogenesis. After cultured with Scutellaria barbatae D. Don, the migration of endothelial cells was examined by Transwell chamber; the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HeLa cells was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).", "Scutellaria barbatae D. Don significantly inhibited angiogenesis in Matrigel; the tube formation number was significantly lower in 20% and 40% medicated serum groups containing Scutellaria barbatae D.

Migrated endothelial cells was significantly fewer in 20% and 40% medicated serum groups containing Scutellaria barbatae D.
