We assessed the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative impacts of quercetin, a plant derivative, on inflammatory and oxidative indices in lung tissue and serum of rats with asthma.Asth ma was induced by ovalbumin. Rats were divided into 4 groups: control, asthma+vehicle (Receieved normal saline), asthma+dexamethasone, and asthma+quercetin. After asthma induction, quercetin (50 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (2.5 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally once daily for 1 week. On day 50, lung histopathology indices; inflammatory factors; tissue gene expression, including GATA Binding Protein 3 (Gata-3), Tbx21 (T-bet), Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), Il10 (IL-10), Il1b (IL-1\u03b2), Il6 (IL-6), Acta2 (\u03b1-SMA), and Tnf (TNF-\u03b1); and oxidative stress indices (malondialdehyde [MDA], catalase [CAT], glutathione\u00a0peroxidase [GPX], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and total antioxidant capacity [TAC]) in tissue and serum, were evaluated. The results showed that quercetin reduced Gata3, Tnf, Tgfb1, Il1b, and Acta2 gene expression and increased Tbx21 gene expression following asthma. Quercetin also improved oxidative stress by decreasing MDA levels and increasing TAC, CAT, SOD, and GPX levels in serum and lung tissue. Furthermore, quercetin decreased IL6 and TNF\u03b1 levels and increased IL10 levels in lung tissue after asthma was treated with quercetin. Quercetin ameliorates oxidative stress and inflammation caused by asthma, especially at the tissue level. Therefore, quercetin can be considered a potent antiasthmatic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Afzalipour Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran AND Physiology Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran AND Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Afzalpour Medical Faculty, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. aminrajizadeh@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Rajizadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Amin", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physiology Research Center, Institute of Neuropharmacology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran AND Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Afzalpour Medical Faculty, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. m.bejeshk@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Bejeshk", "ForeName": "Mohammad Abbas", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran AND Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran. amirhosseindoustimotlagh@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Afzalpour Medical Faculty, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran AND Cardiovascular Research Center, Institute of Basic and Clinical Physiology Sciences, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. najafipourh@yahoo.co.uk."}], "LastName": "Najafipour", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Hormozgan University of Medical Science, Hormozegan, Iran.
