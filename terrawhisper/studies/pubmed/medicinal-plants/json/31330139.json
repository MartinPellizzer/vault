Previous studies have shown that cannabinoid receptor agonists have analgesic effects in various models of pain. In this study, therefore, we investigated anti-nociceptive effects of WIN 55,212-2, and the role of either CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub> receptors in nitroglycerine (NTG)-induced animal model of migraine.", "The present study was conducted on both male and female rats receiving NTG (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) to induce acute (single dose of NTG) and chronic (repetitive doses of NTG) models of migraine. Additionally, three groups received WIN 55,212-2 (0.33, 1, 3\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) 45\u202fmin before behavioral tests. Additionally, AM251 and AM630 (CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist, respectively, 1\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) were used to evaluate the possible involvement of CB1 and CB2 receptors during the protective effects of WIN 55,212-2.", "We found that NTG (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) in both acute and chronic models increased sensitivity to pain. In acute model, we found that WIN 55,212-2 (almost high doses) decreases the level of pain mainly through CB<sub>1</sub> receptor due to CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist abrogates its protective effects, however, in formalin test CB<sub>2</sub> receptors also had crucial roles in both phases at 3\u202fmg/kg of WIN 55,212-2. In chronic model, WIN 55,212-2 (0.33, 1 and 3\u202fmg/kg) significantly attenuated NTG-induced hyperalgesia through both CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors.", "Our data supported the argument that activation of CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> receptors by WIN 55,212-2 may be considered a new medication for migraine, however in lack of each receptor leads to different responses from deletion to the reduction of analgesic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
