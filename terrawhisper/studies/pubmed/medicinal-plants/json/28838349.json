Tissue culture is the best for propagation of stevia and micro nutrients can affect both morphological traits and steviol glycosides production. Therefore, the effect of different concentrations of KH2PO4on stevia growth factors and gene expression had been studied by tissue culture methods, RT-PCR and HPLC. According the results, bud numbers had increased significantly in MS + 0.034 mMKH2PO4 media and the highest measured length was seen in plants grown under MS + 0.034 mM KH2PO4 treatment. Also, the highest growth rate (1.396 mm/d) was observed in MS + 0.034 mMKH2PO4.The best concentration of KH2PO4 for expression of UGT74G1 was 0.00425mMand the best one for UGT76G1 expression was 0.017mM. Interestingly, the best media for both stevioside and rebaudioside A accumulation was 0.017mM KH2PO4containing media. There was positive correlation between the best media for gene expression and the best one for steviol glycosides production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghari", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaheri", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallah", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti Ale Agha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Isfahan University of Technology, College of Agriculture, Department of Biotechnology, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansarypour", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0YON5MXJ9P", "NameOfSubstance": "stevioside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B3FUD0528F", "NameOfSubstance": "rebaudioside A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B7862WZ632", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium phosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes, Kaurane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28838349", "10.14715/cmb/2017.63.7.18"]}}]}
