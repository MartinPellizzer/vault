As medicinal plants, the extracts of labiate herbs are used directly or indirectly to treat a variety of diseases. Increase in their consumption has led to the fraud in herbal medicines. Hence, modern accurate diagnostic methods must be introduced to differentiate and authenticate these samples. Electrochemical fingerprints have not been evaluated for their capacity to distinguish and classify various genera within a family. Since it is essential to classify, identify, and distinguish between these closely related plants in order to guarantee the quality of the raw materials, the authenticity and quality of 48 dried and fresh Lamiaceae samples, which include Mint, Thyme, Oregano, Satureja, Basil, and Lavender with various geographic origins, were examined. The present study focused on (a) classification and authentication Labiate herbs extracts and (b) identification of active compounds in samples by Gas chromatography and HPLC methods. This was accomplished using principal component analysis (PCA) and PCA-linear discriminate analysis (PCA-LDA). The results of the clustering revealed that PCA-LDA categorized mint species more accurately than PCA. In addition to certain flavonoids including ferulic acid, apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin, HPLC and GC analysis of the ethanolic extract revealed the presence of phenolic acids such as rosmarenic acid, methyl rosmarenate, caffeic acid, cinnamic acid, and chlorogenic acid. Comparing results of PCA-LDA with chromatographic analysis show that the authentication and detection of fraud samples were correctly performed using chemometyrics technique based on CV fingerprints. Even, there was no need to completely identify components of the mint samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
