The plant leaves were dried and extracted using 90% methanol followed by sequential fractionation using liquid-liquid fractionation. The fractions of a diverse polarity including chloroform, n-hexane, methanol and ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts were obtained that was further analysed by using HPLC. The phytochemical screening indicated presence of saponins, triterpenes and flavonoids. During DPPH assay, the methanolic fraction presented highest activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 193.1\u03bcg/mL), followed by ethyl acetate (IC<sub>50</sub> 220\u03bcg/mL) and chloroform (IC<sub>50</sub> 263\u03bcg/mL) fractions respectively. During FRAP assay, FRAP value for Z. nummularia extract 20.43\u03bcM. Among fractions, ethyl acetate fraction presented highest FRAP value (370.2\u03bcM), followed by chloroform (204\u03bcM) and methanolic (249\u03bcM) fractions. The antimicrobial activity of chloroform fraction was significantly high against P. aureginosa (6mm), L. monocytogenes, S. aureus (5mm), K. pneumoniae, B. Subtillus and E. coli (4mm). The ethyl acetate part presented significant activity (MIC 4mg/mL) against S. aureus, B. Subtillus and L. monocytogenes. The total extract and fractions were further tested for MBC and the MBC for ethyl acetate fractions was 4mg/mL, whereas all other fractions exhibited MBC >10mg/mL. No activity was recorded against Aspergillus niger. During antibiofilm assay, n-hexane fraction presented highest inhibition (88%) followed by ethyl acetate (69%) chloroform (65%) fractions. It was concluded that Z. nummularia possess moderate antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. Further a synergistic effect is suggested in formulation having Z. nummularia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gomal University D.I.
