SEM was conducted to increase our understanding of microscopic qualities that are not visible in light microscopy and to elucidate unclear affinities among invasive species. The study examines invasive species' morphological and anatomical characteristics from the Pothohar Plateau of Pakistan for the first time. The results showed that various micromorphological features are very useful for species' accurate identification. Adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves showed variations in subsidiary cells, glands, anticlinal wall patterns, stomata, and epidermal cells. Epidermal cell shapes observed were irregular, elongated, rectangular, and polygonal. Epidermal cells having maximum length were calculated in Stellaria media (126.3 \u03bcm) on adaxial side. On the abaxial surface, the minimum length was noticed in Eucalyptus camaldulensis (28.5 \u03bcm). Both glandular and nonglandular trichomes were examined, ranging from unicellular to multicellular. Most of the investigated specimens of leaves were amphistomatic, while some were hypostomatic, like Alternanthera pungens, Calotropis procera, Cannabis sativa, Lantana camara, and Thevetia peruviana. Leaf epidermal morphology contains numerous useful systematic features for accurate identifications of plant species. The micromorphological attributes under observation provide a standard criterion to the researcher for identifications of invasive flora in future morpho-taxonomic studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
