The current research survey was conducted to investigate drug-induced hepatotoxicity and demographic characteristics of patients with liver damage in the general Maghrebian population between 1992 and 2018. To achieve this goal a questionnaire was adopted to report details on the undesirable effects of drugs and demographic characteristics of affected patients. The results obtained in the current survey showed that 1001 in 25 093 cases of drug-induced toxicity were registered with drug-induced liver damage between 1992 and 2018. Regarding demographic characteristics of affected patients, the most affected age group was 18 to 44-years-old with a percentage of 45.70% followed by the age group 45 to 64-year-old with a percentage of 27.20%. Females were the most frequently affected by the hepatic side effects of drugs vs. males. Paracetamol, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide were the main responsible drugs for liver damage in the study population. Alteration of biological parameters and subclinical phenomena were used as clinical manifestations of liver damage in the study population. The outcome of the present study suggests paying more attention to drugs used for medication and the involvement of rigorous clinical monitoring to prevent or to minimize the side effects of drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Laboratory of Chemistry-Biochemistry, Environment, Nutrition, and Health, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bourhia", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy (Medicinal Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center), College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ullah", "ForeName": "Riaz", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy (Medicinal Aromatic and Poisonous Plants Research Center), College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "S Alqahtani", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, Laboratory of Chemistry-Biochemistry, Environment, Nutrition, and Health, Hassan II University, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Ibenmoussa", "ForeName": "Samir", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2KNI5N06TI", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazinamide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V83O1VOZ8L", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoniazid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Isoniazid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazinamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32715778", "10.1080/01480545.2020.1797088"]}}]}
