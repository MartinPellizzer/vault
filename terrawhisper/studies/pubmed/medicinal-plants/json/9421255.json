Of these species, 26 serve as antihypertensive remedies in traditional medicine, and 38 as diuretics-10 of the 64 species have both alleged antihypertensive and diuretic effects. Of the species examined, 26 have not been reported to have any of these effects. Plant material was extracted with both acetone, ethanol and water, and samples were considered active if ACE inhibition was 50% or more in one of the extracts. Of the species with alleged antihypertensive or diuretic effect, 44% proved active. Of the species with no report of such effects, 31% proved active. There were no overall differences in the range of inhibition of the three extracts, but amongst the species considered active there was a strong negative correlation between inhibition of acetone and water extracts. A statistical analysis of the results demonstrated clear differences between plants with alleged antihypertensive effects, diuretic effects, and no alleged use with respect to inhibition of the three extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, The Royal Danish School of Pharmacy, Copenhagen."}], "LastName": "Adsersen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adsersen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9421255", "10.1016/s0378-8741(97)00100-1", "S0378874197001001"]}}]}
