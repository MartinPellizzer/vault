We investigated whether DG inhibits lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in vivo and in vitro. The mouse ALD model was established by chronically feeding male C57BL/6 mice an ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. In vitro, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with LPS/ATP, whereas HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with ethanol. DG reduced the serum levels of transaminase and serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides and malondialdehyde in ALD mice. DG downregulated SREBP1 and its target genes and upregulated PPAR\u03b1 and its target genes in the liver of mice with ALD. DG inhibited TLR4-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, consequently reversing the inflammatory response, including the production of HMGB1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-36\u03b3, as well as the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. DG blocked NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release in LPS/ATP-stimulated MPMs. When <i>Tlr4</i> was knocked in LPS/ATP-stimulated BMDMs, HMGB1 production and release were blocked, and NLRP3-mediated cleavage and release of IL-1\u03b2 was suppressed in <i>Hmgb1</i>-silenced BMDMs. DG amplified these inhibitory effects in <i>Tlr4</i> or <i>Hmgb1</i> knockdown BMDMs. In ethanol-exposed hepatocytes, DG reduced lipogenesis and promoted lipid oxidation by inhibiting the HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway while suppressing the inflammatory response induced by ethanol exposure. Our data demonstrated that DG inhibited the occurrence of lipid accumulation and the inflammatory response via the HMGB1-TLR4 axis, underscoring a promising approach and utility of DG for the treatment of ALD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Korean Medicine Research (Yanbian University) of
