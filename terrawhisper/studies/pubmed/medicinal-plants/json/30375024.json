On the other hand, Th17 cells have a critical role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In this study, we evaluated redox status in memory CD4 + T cells and plasma of patients with psoriasis and its correlation with IL-17 response. To this end, memory T cells were isolated from 10 patients with psoriasis and 10 controls. Intracellular Glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide as well as IL-17 were measured using flow cytometry. Plasma total anti-oxidant capacity (TAC) was quantified by ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. The expression of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 1(SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2) and cytochrome b-245 beta chain (CYBB) genes were analysed using real-time PCR. Our results showed an increased intracellular ROS production in memory CD4 + T cells of patients compared to controls, (P = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant decrease in expression of catalase gene was found in patients, (P = 0.02). However, no significant differences were observed for intracellular GSH, IL-17 and TAC levels between patients and controls. Also, no correlation was seen between the intracellular IL-17 level and intracellular ROS, GSH and catalase gene expression levels. Collectively, we found an increased ROS production in stimulated memory T cells of patients that could be due to reduced expression of catalase gene. However, it seems that these redox abnormalities have no relationship with IL-17 response in memory T cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute (IAARI), Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Behnaz", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Skin and Stem Cell Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Parvin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7816-4051"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "MS Research Center, Neuroscience Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Occupational Sleep Research Center, Baharloo Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Izad", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "93-04-30-27699", "Agency": "Tehran University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Scand J Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0323767", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9475"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "IL17A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-17"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunologic Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-17"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Th17 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30375024", "10.1111/sji.12730"]}}]}
