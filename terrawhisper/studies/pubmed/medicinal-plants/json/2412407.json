Characterisation and differentiation of isolates from cowpea was made difficult by associated fast-growing bacteria inside the nodule tissue. Thus, reliable pure culture was difficult to secure without repeated isolation and even via nodulation of the appropriate homologous host. Although the technique may be satisfactory for differentiation and identification of fast-growing rhizobia, it is rated inferior to serology on aspects of facility, time and accuracy where rhizobia from cowpea nodules are concerned. Fingerprint patterns of isolates revealed considerable heterogeneity amongst the populations even where there was commonality of location and/or host plant. Pure cultures of slow-growing rhizobia from V. unguiculata nodules were generally more resistant to the concentrations of antibiotics used than fast-growing nodule bacteria from P. vulgaris."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dakora", "ForeName": "F D", "Initials": "FD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Microbiol Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "7610362", "ISSNLinking": "0137-1320"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2412407"]}}]}
