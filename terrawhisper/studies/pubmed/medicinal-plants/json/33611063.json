To date, no medications for NAFLD have been approved by relevant governmental agencies. Emerging evidence indicates that innate immune mechanisms are pivotal drivers of inflammation and other pathological manifestations observed in NAFLD. Hyperoside, a flavonoid compound mainly found in medicinal plants, has many biological effects, but the role of hyperoside in the physiological process of NAFLD is poorly defined. This study demonstrated that hyperoside exerts protective effects against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD and regulates macrophage polarization in an Nr4A1-dependent manner. After 16\u00a0weeks on a HFD, hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammatory responses were significantly ameliorated in hyperoside-treated HFD-fed wild-type mice, and hyperoside facilitated the polarization of macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 subtype. Nr4A1 was found to be upregulated in hyperoside-treated HFD-fed mice, and hyperoside did not improve HFD-induced NAFLD or regulate macrophage polarization in Nr4A1-deficient mice. In conclusion, hyperoside may have therapeutic potential in preventing the pathological progression of NAFLD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
