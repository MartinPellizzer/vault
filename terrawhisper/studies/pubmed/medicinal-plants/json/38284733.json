Despite many efforts, the definitive treatment for lupus has not been fully understood. Curcumin (CUR) and berberine (BBR) have significant immunomodulatory roles and anti-inflammatory properties that have been demonstrated in various studies. This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of CUR and BBR on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) with an special focus on the maturation and activation of DCs.", "Human monocytes were isolated from the heparinized blood of SLE patients and healthy individuals, which were then exposed to cytokines (IL-4 and GM-CSF) for five days to produce immature DCs. Then, the obtained DCs were characterized by FITC-uptake assay and then cultured in the presence of CUR, BBR, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 48 h. Finally, the maturation of DCs was analyzed by the level of maturation using flow cytometry or real-time PCR methods.", "The results showed promising anti-inflammatory effects of CUR and BBR in comparison with LPS, supported by a significant reduction of not only co-stimulatory and antigen-presenting factors such as CD80, CD86, CD83, CD1a, CD14, and HLA-DR but also inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12.", "CUR and BBR could arrest DC maturation and develop a tolerogenic DC phenotype that subsequently promoted the expression of inhibitory cytokines and reduced the secretion of proinflammatory markers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Medicine Research Center, Hormozgan Health Institute, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nikpoor", "ForeName": "Amin Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoudi", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shapouri-Moghaddam", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rheumatic Diseases Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaieyazdi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural products and medicinal plants research center\u066bnorth Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd\u060cIran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabasi", "ForeName": "Nafiseh", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Atena", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Modarres Moghadam", "ForeName": "Reyhane", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Momtazi", "ForeName": "Amir Abbas", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Sciences, College of Medicine, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Najmaldin", "ForeName": "Soran K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Analysis, Faculty of Applied Science, Tishk International University, Erbil, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Kamal Kheder", "ForeName": "Ramiar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9371-4170"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Esmaeili", "ForeName": "Seyed-Alireza", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101467997", "ISSNLinking": "1874-4672"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38284733", "10.2174/0118761429249908231221080806", "CMP-EPUB-138029"]}}]}
