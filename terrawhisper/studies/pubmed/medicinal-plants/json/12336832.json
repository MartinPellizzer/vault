In this rural community medicinal plants are used for regulating fertility. Due to the fact that the majority of the Bhat community is illiterate, oral interviews were held in the villages. The information was then recorded. Plant samples were collected and preserved for future reference. Information on 28 plants and 11 recipes for doses from 2 or more vegetable species are presented, and popular names, empirical properties, and manner of using recipes are described. More than 90% of the information gathered was consistent among the informants, but some of the informants differed in their reports on the way to use the same plants. There is no certainty as to which of the plants are effective. Since the Bhat community has frequently observed the positive effects of their preparations, they have much faith in their recipes. The acceptability of these preparations is quite high among 95% of the Bhat population."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["002163", "00085465"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: Economic Botany"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Asia", "Community Surveys", "Contraception", "Cultural Background", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Ethnic Groups", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Method Acceptability", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Reproductive Control Agents", "Research Methodology", "Residence Characteristics", "Rural Population", "Sampling Studies", "Southern Asia", "Studies", "Surveys"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12336832", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "08", "Day": "04"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0013-0001", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "34", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980", "Season": "Jul-Sep"}}, "Title": "Economic botany", "ISOAbbreviation": "Econ Bot"}, "ArticleTitle": "Plants used by the Bhat community for regulating fertility.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "273", "EndPage": "275", "MedlinePgn": "273-5"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lata", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Econ Bot", "NlmUniqueID": "0007275", "ISSNLinking": "0013-0001"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reproductive Control Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Data Collection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproductive Control Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Residence Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sampling Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12336832", "10.1007/BF02858647"]}}]}
