Medicinal herbs, commonly used in herbal medicine and subsequently discarded, are rich in natural polymer substances, making them promising candidates for various material industries. TEMPO-oxidized cellulose was extracted from medicinal herb residue, and the physicochemical properties of an ultra-hydrophilic elastic sponge, prepared through a PVA and CA impregnate cross-linking process, were investigated. The fabricated composite sponge exhibited an increase in compressive stress-strain proportional to the PVA cross-linking concentration, and its water retention capability was assessed through retention tests. Swelling tests for various solvents were conducted to evaluate the potential use of the sponge in diverse industries, revealing the highest swelling ratio in water. Pressure distribution measurements using prescale film indicated that the sponge's shock absorption capacity was enhanced by PVA cross-linking, leading to improved pressure dispersion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
