Patients experience pain after CABG. Pain may increase postoperative complications and decrease quality of life (QoL). This study aims to determine the lavandula aromatherapy effect on patients' pain after CABG.", "98 patients undergoing CABG were randomly assigned to intervention and placebo groups. The intervention group inhaled 5-drops of 20\u00a0% lavandula essential oil (LEO) and the placebo group was exposed to 5-drop of distilled water. LEO or distilled water were dropped into a sterile gauze converted to the form of a necklace. The subjects wore necklace for three consecutive days and intervention was performed each 24\u00a0h. The pain intensity, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured before each intervention and 30\u00a0min after it. Also, the mean analgesic intake was recorded. SPSS version 16 was used to analyze the data.", "The mean pain score measured in the intervention group showed a more decrease than that obtained in the placebo group after the first and second interventions. Additionally, the mean pain score in the intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease than the placebo group after the second intervention (P=0.008). Moreover, mean SBP after the second intervention (P=0.046) and mean DBP after the first intervention (P=0.029) revealed a significant difference between two groups. Moreover, the intervention group received less analgesic than the placebo group.", "Lavandula aromatherapy can reduce pain and received analgesic dose after CABG."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
