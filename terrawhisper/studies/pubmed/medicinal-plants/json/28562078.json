In our continued investigation of the biological activity of A. myriophylla, the ethanol extract, fractions and the isolated compounds from the wood of this plant were evaluated for in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition using spectrophotometric method. The plant ethanol extract and its different fractions possessed \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Dichloromethane fraction of the wood ethanol extract exhibited the highest percent inhibition against \u03b1-glucosidase (69.30%) among all fractions. Subsequent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assay proved that indenoic acid (1), 8-methoxy-7, 3',4'-trihydroxyflavone (2) and 3,4,7,3'-tetrahydroxyflavan (3) were partially rational for antidiabetic effect of this plant species. Among these compounds, 3 (IC<sub>50</sub> 98.59\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) exhibited potent inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase, compared with a positive control acarbose (IC<sub>50</sub> 125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The inhibitory effect towards \u03b1-glucosidase of compounds 1-3 was reported herein for the first time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Traditional Thai Medicine , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Excellent Research Laboratory on Natural Products, Faculty of Science and Natural Product Research Center of Excellence , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Joycharat", "ForeName": "Nantiya", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Traditional Thai Medicine , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Issarachote", "ForeName": "Papawarin", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Faculty of Traditional Thai Medicine , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sontimuang", "ForeName": "Chonlatid", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Excellent Research Laboratory on Natural Products, Faculty of Science and Natural Product Research Center of Excellence , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Faculty of Science, Department of Microbiology , Prince of Songkla University , Songkhla , Thailand."}], "LastName": "Voravuthikunchai", "ForeName": "Supayang Piyawan", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Albizzia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28562078", "10.1080/14786419.2017.1333990"]}}]}
