Even though there are several treatment regimens available in the clinics against this disease, a perfect chemotherapeutic agent for the same is still under investigation. Natural plant-derived secondary metabolites are used in clinics to treat leukemia for better benefits with reduced side-effects. Likely, several bioactive compounds from Callistemon sp. were reported for their bioactive benefits. Furthermore, acylphloroglucinol derivatives from Callistemon salignus, showed both antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities in various adherent human cancer cell lines. Thus, in the present study, a natural acylphloroglucinol (2,6-dihydroxy-4-methoxyisobutyrophenone, L72) was tested for its antiproliferative efficacy in HEL cells. The MTT and the cell cycle analysis study revealed that L72 treatment can offer antiproliferative effects, both time and dose-dependent manner, causing G<sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest. The western blot analysis revealed that L72 treatment triggered intrinsic apoptotic machinery and activated p21. Likewise, L72 could downregulate the gene expressions of XIAP, FLT3, IDH2, and SOD2, which was demonstrated by qPCR analysis, thus promoting its antiproliferative action. The L72 could impede STAT3 expression, which was evidenced by insilico autodock analysis and western blot analysis using STAT3 inhibitor, Pimozide. The treatment of transgenic (Flk-1+/egfr+) zebrafish embryos resulted in the STAT3 gene inhibition, proving its anti-angiogenic effect, as well. Thus, the study revealed that L72 could act as an antiproliferative agent, by triggering caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis, reducing cell proliferation by attenuating STAT3, and activating an anti-angiogenic pathway via Flk-1inhibition."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
