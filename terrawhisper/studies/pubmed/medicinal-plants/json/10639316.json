Coinoculation, but not sequential inoculation, of CPMV with similar concentrations of another Comovirus; Cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV), resulted in reduced numbers of CPSMV-induced lesions. This apparent, CPMV-mediated reduction in number of CPSMV-induced infection centers was termed concurrent protection. We report results obtained by inoculating two nearly isogenic cowpea lines derived from a CPMV-susceptible cowpea crossed to Arlington, one line CPMV-susceptible and the other resistant. The CPMV virions B and M, encapsidating genomic RNAs 1 and 2, respectively, were extensively purified by gradient centrifugation. In the CPMV-resistant cowpea, either CPMV or CPMV B affected concurrent protection against CPSMV and against two distinct non-Comoviruses: Cherry leafroll virus and Southern bean mosaic virus. Adding CPMV M to the inoculum did not enhance CPMV-B-mediated protection. CPMV B was ineffective in protecting CPMV-susceptible cowpea. We postulate that CPMV-mediated concurrent protection is elicited in CPMV-resistant cowpea by a CPMV RNA-1-encoded factor and acts to reduce accumulation or spread of CPMV and certain coinoculated challenging viruses in or from the inoculated cell. Coinoculated CPMV did not protect CPMV-resistant cowpea against Tomato bushy stunt virus or Cucumber mosaic virus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, University of California, Davis, California, 95616, USA. gebruening@ucdavis.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bruening", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Buzayan", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ferreiro", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Secoviridae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Tombusvirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10639316", "10.1006/viro.1999.0099", "S0042-6822(99)90099-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
