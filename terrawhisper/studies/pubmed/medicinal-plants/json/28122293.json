The inhibition of BAFF expression is an emerging therapeutic approach for these disorders. Chicoric acid (CA), a bioactive phytochemical found in several widely used traditional medicinal plants, has significant anti-inflammatory activity and anti-arthritic effects. However, the role of CA in modulation of BAFF expression remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CA reduced BAFF expression in human B lymphocyte cell lines and decreased the DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in the BAFF promoter region. Furthermore, CA inhibited both the nuclear translocation of p65 (the subunit of NF-\u03baB) and the phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB). These results suggest that CA suppresses BAFF expression by inhibiting NF-\u03baB activity, and CA may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to down-regulate excessive BAFF expression in autoimmune diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
