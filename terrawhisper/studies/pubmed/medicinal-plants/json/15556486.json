The focus of this review paper is on the analytical methodologies, which included the combination of sample preparation tools and chromatographic techniques for the chemical standardization of marker compounds or active ingredients in botanicals and herbal preparations. The common problems and key challenges in the chemical standardization of botanicals and herbal preparations were discussed. As sample preparation is the most important step in the development of analytical methods for the analysis of constituents present in botanicals and herbal preparations, the strength and weakness of different extraction techniques are discussed. For the analysis of compounds present in the plant extracts, the applications of common chromatographic techniques, such as HPLC, CE, HRGC/MS, HPLC/MS and HPLC/MS/MS are discussed. The strength, weakness and applicability of various separation tools are stated. Procedures for the identification of marker or active compounds in plant extracts, using HPLC/MS, were proposed. Finally, the effects of batch-to-batch variation of the medicinal plants are investigated and discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Science School, Temasek Polytechnic, 21 Tampinese Avenue 1, Singapore 529757, Republic of Singapore. esong@tp.edu.sg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101139554", "ISSNLinking": "1570-0232"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}], "NumberOfReferences": "84"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15556486", "10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.07.041", "S1570-0232(04)00647-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
