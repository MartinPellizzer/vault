Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new and effective agents to reduce mortality. The plants of genus Inula have gained the attention of researchers worldwide as a rich source of potent medicinal compounds.", "This study explores the anti-cancer activity of Britannin, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Inula aucheriana DC., and its molecular mechanism in gastric cancer cells, AGS and MKN45.", "Cytotoxicity was evaluated through the MTT assay following 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h treatment with different concentrations of Britannin. Apoptosis rate and caspase-3 activity were measured 24 h after treatment by Britannin. . Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of the NF-\u03baB, I\u03baB\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 proteins. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR was applied to measure the expression of NF-\u03baB target genes.", "We showed that Britannin induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Britannin caused an elevation in mRNA and protein levels of PPAR\u03b3. The involvement of PPAR\u03b3 was more confirmed using GW9662, a PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor. Suppression of NF-\u03baB was demonstrated by western blot analysis. Down-regulation of MMP-9, TWIST-1, COX-2, and Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax were also observed in gastric cancer cells.", "These results imply that activation of the PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathway through suppression of NF-\u03baB underlies the anti-cancer properties of Britannin in gastric cancer. Therefore, Britannin could be considered as a promising anti-cancer candidate for further evaluation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdolmohammadi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roozbehani", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamzeloo-Moghadam", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallahian", "ForeName": "Faranak", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "britannin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inula"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37723632", "10.2174/1871520623666230918140559", "ACAMC-EPUB-134642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
