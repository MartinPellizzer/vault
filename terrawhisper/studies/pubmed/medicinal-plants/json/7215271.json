A secondary purpose was to determine whether the training of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) would be of value and to identify the critical lessons and skills that the TBA must learn. Questionnaire forms were sent in late 1976 to physicians in charge of the district and mission hospitals in the region and to midwives of the larger maternity units. Information was requested on every death occurring in pregnancy or within 42 days of delivery, ectopic pregnancy, or abortion, during 1977. There were 118 maternal deaths. 112 took place in the hospital and 6 at home. It is likely that many unreported deaths occurred at home; the mortality figures for the region appear to be a gross under-estimate. Information about the cause of death was received for 116 of the deaths. Analysis was based on 109 cases. Of these, 4 deaths were due to abortion, 3 to ectopic pregnancy and 6 others occurred before the 28th week of gestation. In 103 cases, where death occurred after the 16th week of gestation, only 33 women were known to have attended antenatal clinics. 42 women had not attended, and the information was unavailable in 28 cases. Toxic effects of herbal medicines was diagnosed in a significant number of cases. Shortage of blood for transfusion was a problem of major significance. The training of TBAs is recommended as a means for strengthening maternity services."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["000906", "00085712"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: EAST AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Eastern Africa", "English Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Malawi", "Maternal Health Services", "Maternal Mortality", "Maternal-child Health Services", "Midwives", "Mortality", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Dynamics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Primary Health Care", "Research Methodology", "Sampling Studies", "Studies", "Surveys", "Training Activities"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7215271", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "06", "Day": "23"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0012-835X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "58", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1981", "Month": "Jan"}}, "Title": "East African medical journal", "ISOAbbreviation": "East Afr Med J"}, "ArticleTitle": "Analysis of maternal deaths in the Central Region of Malawi.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "25", "EndPage": "36", "MedlinePgn": "25-36"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bullough", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Kenya", "MedlineTA": "East Afr Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0372766", "ISSNLinking": "0012-835X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malawi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Obstetric Labor Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7215271"]}}]}
