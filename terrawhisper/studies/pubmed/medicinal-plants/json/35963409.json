Despite its low cost and environmentally safe nature, bioremediation technology is not always successful, mainly because of the soil toxicity to the degrading microbial populations and plants. Here we report a three-year microfield experiment on the influence of natural sorbents of mineral (zeolite, kaolinite, vermiculite, diatomite), organic (peat), carbonaceous (biochar) origin, and a mixed sorbent ACD (composed of granular activated carbon and diatomite) on the bioremediation of grey forest soil contaminated with weathered crude oil (40.1 g total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) kg<sup>-1</sup>). Optimal doses of the sorbents significantly accelerated bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil through bioaugmentation followed by phytoremediation. The main reason for the influence of the sorbent amendments relied upon the creation of optimal conditions for the activation of hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria and plant growth due to the reduction of soil toxicity, as well as maintaining an optimal pH and water-air regime in the soil. That happened because of reducing the soil hydrophobicity, increasing porosity and water holding capacity. The content of the TPH in the best samples (2% biochar or ACD) reduced to their local permissible concentration accepted for remediated soils in the Russian Federation (\u22645 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) after two warm seasons compared to that after three warm seasons in the other samples. Although some sorbents decelerated biodegradation of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, including benzo(a)pyrene) in the soil, the overall risk from the residual contaminants present in the remediated soil and plants was minimized. The final total content of the main PAHs in the sorbent-amended soils did not exceed the maximal permissible levels that are accepted in most EU countries (1000-40,000 \u03bcg kg<sup>-1</sup>), and they did not accumulate in the aboveground phytomass of grasses in dangerous concentrations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
