This region comprises of eight states (Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura) with diverse ethnic communities having invaluable traditional knowledge/practices, passed through genesis. The medicinal plants in this region are rich in natural products/phytochemicals and have been used extensively by pharmaceutical industries. The present study is an attempt to develop a comprehensive resource of the medicinal plants with a quantitative analysis of the phytochemicals which can enhance knowledge on therapeutic indications and contribute in drug discovery and development. The database is a collection of 561 unique plants comprising of 9225 phytochemicals. The physiochemical properties of the phytochemicals were analyzed using indigenous python scripts whereas for the ADMET properties, open access servers were used. The data available in NEI-MPDB will help to connect the cutting-edge approach of various research groups and will help to translate the information into economic wealth by the pharmaceutical industries. The database is openly accessible at https://neist.res.in/neimpdb/."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
