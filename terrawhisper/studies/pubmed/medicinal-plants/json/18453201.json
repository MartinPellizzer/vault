In the Song Dynasty, the differentiation of Radix Paeoniae Rubra and Radix Paeoniae Alba was based on the color of its root, and from Yuan to Qing Dynasty, based on the color of its flower. In modern times, this is based on whether it is cultivated and processed or not. Radix Paeoniae was selected and eventually cultivated as ornamental plants of Paeonia for enjoyment from the Song to Ming Dynasties. The wild plants of Paeonia with single-petal flower were cultivated for medicinal use because of the esteem by the doctors. The current method of differentiation of Radix Paeoniae was formed in the 20th century."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Key Laboratory of Modern Pharmacology, School of Materia Madica of Anhui College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hefei 230031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "De-Qun", "Initials": "DQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Yi Shi Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8303081", "ISSNLinking": "0255-7053"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 21st Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["history", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18453201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
