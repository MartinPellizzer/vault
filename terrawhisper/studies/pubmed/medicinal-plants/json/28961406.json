Traditionally, species identification is based on morphological traits; however, the highly similar morphological traits among species of Physalis make this approach difficult. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using a popular DNA barcode, the chloroplast psbA-trnH intergenic region, in the identification of species of Physalis. Thirty-six psbA-trnH regions of species of Physalis and of the closely related plant Nicandra physalodes were analyzed. The success rates of PCR amplification and sequencing of the psbA-trnH region were 100%. MEGA V6.0 was utilized to align the psbA-trnH sequences and to compute genetic distances. The results show an apparent barcoding gap between intra- and interspecific variations. Results of both BLAST1 and nearest-distance methods prove that the psbA-trnH regions can be used to identify all species examined in the present study. In addition, phylogenetic analysis using psbA-trnH data revealed a distinct boundary between species. It also confirmed the relationship between species of Physalis and closely related species, as established by previous studies. In conclusion, the psbA-trnH intergenic region can be used as an efficient DNA barcode for the identification of species of Physalis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Bioscience & Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha 410128, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Shangguo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Kaili", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yujia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Shandong Xiajin First Middle School, Xiajin 253200, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongfen", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Mengying", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 310036, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huizhong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Intergenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "photosystem II, psbA subunit"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Genome. 2018 Jun;61(6):467. doi: 10.1139/gen-2018-0074", "PMID": "29701068"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Intergenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Chloroplast"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Physalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28961406", "10.1139/gen-2017-0115"]}}]}
