Six Beagle dogs were administrated a single intravenous dosage of 28 mg of breviscapine liposomes and reference preparation, respectively, scutellarin in plasma of 6 dogs at different sampling time was determined by RP-HPLC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by 3P97 program and compared by statistic analysis.", "The mean concentration-time curves of breviscapine liposomes and reference preparation were both fitted to two-compartment model with the main pharmacokinetic parameters as follows: T 1/2 alpha were (4.4 +/- 0.7) min and (1.8 +/- 1.3) min respectively; T 1/2 beta were (55 +/- 27) min and (28 +/- 23) min respectively; V(c) were (1 580 +/- 265) mL and (2 460 +/- 2 200) mL respectively; CL(s) were (88 +/- 10) mL x min(-1) and (324 +/- 69) mL x min(-1) respectively; and AUC(0-720) were (363 +/- 42) microg x min x mL(-1) and (102 +/- 19) microg x min x mL(-1) respectively. The T 1/2 alpha, CL(s) and AUC(0-720) of breviscapine liposomes all had significant difference from those of reference preparation, after the data were examined by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).", "Compared with the reference preparation, breviscapine liposomes had a much more higher concentration in plasma and contained characteristic of sustained-release, which ameliorated the pharmacokinetic properties of scutellarin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lo", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jian-Xin", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ping", "ForeName": "Qi-Neng", "Initials": "QN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chu-Wei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "116122-36-2", "NameOfSubstance": "breviscapine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16IGP0ML9A", "NameOfSubstance": "scutellarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V515PI7F6", "NameOfSubstance": "Apigenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Apigenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Over Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erigeron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16683523"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
