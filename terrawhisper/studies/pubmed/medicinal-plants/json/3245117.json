Whereas RLB significantly (P less than 0.05) increased hepatic GLDH and decreased ICDH activities respectively, dietary CN, TI and Hgg whether acting individually or jointly had no significant influence on GLDH. Only the CN-containing diets significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated ICDH activity when compared with the control. Raw lima bean significantly (P less than 0.05) depressed OCT activity while neither the individual nor collective effects of these factors were significant. Dietary CN + TI + Hgg interaction depressed maltase activity to approximately the same extent as RLB in all the intestinal regions. These factors had neither individual nor collective effects on sucrase in the small intestine. Lactase activity in the small intestine was influenced only by the RLB diet, while CN + Hgg, and CN + TI + Hgg dietary combinations induced significant (P less than 0.05) elevations in the activities of cellobiase when compared with the control. Although synergism of action is indicated in a number of instances, it is suggested that these factors may need to combine with others within the bean, perhaps synergistically, to elicit comparable anti-nutritional influences as the RLB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production and Health, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Aletor", "ForeName": "V A", "Initials": "VA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fetuga", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Vet Hum Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7704194", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6296"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.3.3", "NameOfSubstance": "Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Disaccharidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyanides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Disaccharidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ornithine Carbamoyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3245117"]}}]}
