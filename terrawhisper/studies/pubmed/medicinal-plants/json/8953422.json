In the three chapters of prescriptions that remain extant today, there are 517 Islamic drugs carrying Arabic or Persian names, each with its Chinese transliteration. Chapter 12 deals with the 'wind' diseases, containing 199 Islamic drugs. In this research, 129 items were identified, and each of which was assigned to a definite taxon; these are the most frequently cited drugs in the formulary. Identifications were corroborated by botanical, pharmacological and phonetic considerations. This exercise demonstrates the inherent affinity between Islamic and Chinese medicines. The reciprocal influence between them greatly enriched the content of these two important bodies of drug science, thus, setting a pattern for the synthesis of drug knowledge and the regulation of therapeutic substances. Recognition of different bodies of ethnomedicine is necessary in view of the fact that there is an increasing mobility of people today, who tend to bring with them their drug knowledge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Department, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Peoples Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Formularies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, Medieval"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Islam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Arabic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mongolia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminology as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8953422", "10.1016/s0378-8741(96)01452-3", "S0378-8741(96)01452-3"]}}]}
