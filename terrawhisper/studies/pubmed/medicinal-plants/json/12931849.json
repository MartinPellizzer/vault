HPLC analysis showed that the commercial samples all contained quinolizidine alkaloids and a total of nine chromatographic peaks were identified by referring to standard compounds, HPLC/MS analysis and comparison of the physicochemical data of the isolated peak with the literature. The contents of the major alkaloids were determined and the ratio of the major alkaloids contents was shown to be correlated with their source of origin. The commercial samples from China gave a distinct HPLC pattern showing the main alkaloids contents. The sample preparations were researched and the extraction conditions of the alkaloids were optimized. Reproducible HPLC fingerprints can be obtained for the quinolizidine alkaloids under the well-controlled extraction conditions. The HPLC fingerprint analysis method is suitable for the quality control of the Radix Sophorae Flavescentis and the standardization of phytomedicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Department of Traditional Chinese Medicines College, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 103 Wen Hua Street, Shenyang, 110016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hai-Yan", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Asian Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "100888334", "ISSNLinking": "1028-6020"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolizines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolizines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12931849", "10.1080/1028602031000082043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
