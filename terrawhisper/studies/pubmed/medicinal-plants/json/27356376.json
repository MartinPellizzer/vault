All the sequences of the samples including six related sequences downloaded from NCBI were analyzed by computing the Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) genetic distance and the neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree, then the method of DNA barcoding identification technology of Ardisiae Japonicae Herba based on ITS2 sequence was established. Combined with online comparison of sequences, the method was used to detect 15 samples of Ardisiae Japonicae Herba from the market to distinguish authenticity.", "The maximum and the average intra-specific K2P genetic distance of Ardisia japonica were all less than the minimum and the average inter-specific K2P genetic distance, and Ardisia japonica and its adulterants could be separated by computing the NJ phylogenetic tree.
