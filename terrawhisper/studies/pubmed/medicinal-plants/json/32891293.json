Accordingly, we aimed to determine the prevalence and patterns of HM use during pregnancy in Lusaka Province, Zambia.", "A survey-based (interviewer-administered), cross-sectional, multicentre study was conducted in 446 adult pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in June/July 2019.", "Overall, 57.8% of participants reported using HM during their current pregnancy, with a mean of 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 remedies/woman. Logistic regression analysis showed that HM use was significantly associated with HM use in prior pregnancies (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and willingness to use HM in the future (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The most commonly used herbs were lemon for nausea/vomiting and common cold, soybean to boost energy, ginger for common cold and nausea/vomiting, and Aloe vera for skin care. The perceived safety of HM (37.6%) and its complementary action with conventional medicines (35.3%) were the main reasons for HM use.", "HM use among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Lusaka Province, Zambia is common, and a wide range of herbs is used."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
