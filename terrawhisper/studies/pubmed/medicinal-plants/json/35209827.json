Research literature from 2010-2020 was searched and it was found that various medicinal plants and their phytoconstituents are effective in treating wounds associated with diabetes. Potential medicinal plants that are used to treat wounds and can be used to treat diabetes have been determined.", "Research and review articles from 2010-2020 have been researched on a variety of topics such as PubMed, Scopus, Mendeley, Google Scholar, Indian traditional medicine system, Ayurvedic treatment programme using different words such as \"diabetes\", \"treatment of diabetes\", \"plants in the treatment of diabetes\", \"wound healing\", \"wound healing plants\".", "Other herbs are also traditionally used to treat wounds. In this study, the main focus is on medicinal plants that are used specifically to treat wounds in diabetic conditions. Although quite a few medicinal flora for wound restoration may be observed in the literature, there is a need for the isolation and characterization of the bioactive compounds responsible for the wound restoration properties. Also, cytotoxicity research needs to be conducted on promising agents or bioactive fractions or extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "M.M.
