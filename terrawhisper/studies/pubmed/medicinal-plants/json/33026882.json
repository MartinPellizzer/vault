Developing new drug or therapeutic strategies against MRSA is urgently needed. Increasing evidence has shown that herbal extracts and antibiotics can have synergistic effects against MRSA. This review focuses on commonly used antibiotics combined with herbal extracts against MRSA and the corresponding mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we found that herbal extracts combined with antibiotics, such as \u03b2-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and glycopeptides, could greatly enhance the antibacterial effects of the antibiotics, reduce the dosage and toxic side effects, and reverse MRSA resistance. Therefore, we conclude that herbal extracts combined with antibiotics may be a promising strategy to combat MRSA. This review provides a novel idea for overcoming antibiotic resistance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6625-8640"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory
