We report here that the spontaneous platelet aggregation induced by reduced barometric pressure (253 torr for three hours) is inhibited by 1:10(7) diluted Japanese herbal plant oil (JHP) and also by two of its major constituents, menthone and menthol with the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the millimolar range. These drugs gave essentially similar results when collagen and ADP were used as aggregating agents. Inhibitor concentrations were determined by microscopic examination of platelets in wet preparations when the aggregating stimulus was reduced pressure and by optical aggregometry when collagen and ADP were the aggregating agents. Potential usefulness of these compounds in the prevention of decompression syndrome (DCS) and acute mountain sickness (AMS) are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murayama", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumaroo", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Thromb Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0326377", "ISSNLinking": "0049-3848"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1490-04-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Menthol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Decompression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrostatic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Menthol"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3715814", "10.1016/0049-3848(86)90214-8"]}}]}
