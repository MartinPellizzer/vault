However, little is known about their ability to recognise distinct epitopes present in mistletoe extracts. To estimate this, ML-1, ML-2 and ML-3 were analysed by Western blot analysis using high titred anti-ML antibody positive sera from cancer patients treated with different mistletoe extracts. In these experiments we could clearly demonstrate that anti-ML antibodies bind to ML-1 A- and B-chains and, in addition, that they recognised a spectrum of other antigens. This kind of immunological response varied from one individual to another and was not influenced by the different mistletoe extracts. Elution studies showed that anti-ML-1 A-chain or B-chain specific antibodies cross-reacted with A- or B-chains of the other lectins indicating homologies between these molecules (probably in the glycosylated side chain). However, the unglycosylated ML-3 A-chain was only detectable by antibodies specific for the ML-3 A-chain. From our data it has to be concluded that different epitopes of the mistletoe extracts are involved in the induction of the humoral immune response during mistletoe therapy and also that cross-reactivity between the different ML exist."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krebsforschung Herdecke, Communal Hospital, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pf\u00fcller", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berg", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10096425", "10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00301-2", "S0304-3835(98)00301-2"]}}]}
