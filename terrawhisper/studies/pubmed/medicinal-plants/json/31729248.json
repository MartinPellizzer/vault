Conventional extraction strategies are tedious and need more solvents and are no more relevant for thermal sensitive plant components. This review emphasize on the working and significance of microwave extraction technology in herbal research and medical field. The extraction step must be more yielding; quick, particular, not more solvent consuming, ensuring stability of thermolabile components and these features are available with microwave extraction method. In this nonconventional technology heat is created utilizing microwave energy. The important parameters that influence extraction efficiency are solvent properties, volume, duration of exposure, microwave control, system attributes, temperature and application were discussed in this article. The microwave assisted extraction, as green technology is contrasted with other extraction technique. This review is intended to discuss this green extraction technique along with its critical parameters for extracting bioactive compounds from complex plant matrices."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6767-7556"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy & Technology Management, SVKM's NMIMS, Shirpur, India."}], "LastName": "Bagade", "ForeName": "Shashikant B", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy & Technology Management, SVKM's NMIMS, Shirpur, India."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Mayur", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Solid Phase Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31729248", "10.1080/10408347.2019.1686966"]}}]}
