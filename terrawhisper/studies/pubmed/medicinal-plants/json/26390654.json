The result showed that similarity of shared peak in XRD of conventional dairy Nanhanshuishi was > 95%, This XRD characteristic fingerprint of conventional dairy Nanhanshuishi had strong specificity, could be used to provide a reference for identification and quality evaluation. This study also showed that the similarity of microware dairy products and conventional dairy products was good, and the sample of microwave 15 min was the best, and new dairy method by the microwave could replace the traditional method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Lin-yan", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jian-feng", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Zi-ming", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gao-ping", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yong-ping", "Initials": "YP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Ray Diffraction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26390654"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
