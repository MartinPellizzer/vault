MAIN RESULTS. Nine treatment trials and 4 prevention trials fitting the selection criteria were found. Eight of the treatment trials reported generally positive results, and 3 of the prevention trials reported marginal benefit. Methodologic quality of the majority of the trials was modest.", "Evidence from published trials suggests that Echinacea may be beneficial for the early treatment of acute URIs. The influence of publication bias on those results is unknown. Echinacea preparations vary widely in composition, and are often found in combination with other potentially active constituents, making specific dose recommendations problematic. There is very little evidence supporting the prolonged use of Echinacea for the prevention of URIs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 53715, USA. bbarrett@fammed.wisc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barrett", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vohmann", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calabrese", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Fam Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "7502590", "ISSNLinking": "0094-3509"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Fam Pract. 1999 Dec;48(12):939-40.", "PMID": "10628570"}, {"RefSource": "J Fam Pract. 1999 Dec;48(12):1001-2.", "PMID": "10628585"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Tract Infections"}], "NumberOfReferences": "71"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10496642"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
