Ticks, specifically Rhipicephalus microplus cause substantial economic and health impacts on more than eighty percent of the world cattle population. Though synthetic acaricides play a major role in tick management, their injudicious usage has caused environmental pollution and also promote the establishment of multi-acaricide resistant tick populations which is a matter of great concern. To provide an effective tool for controlling these resistant ticks, the present work was aimed to develop safe and inexpensive antitick natural formulations. Our bioprospection studies of Ageratum conyzoides plant established it as a species potentially having strong acaricidal activity due to the presence of potent acaricidal phyto-chemicals. To develop a suitable antitick natural formulation, 41 samples/fractions/formulations were prepared from the dry powder of the whole aerial part of the A. conyzoides plant using different techniques and delivery matrices. The strongest antitick effect was recorded for formulation ACF6, which demonstrated 87 \u00b1 6% mean mortality with 57 % inhibition of oviposition in treated female ticks. Ticks treated with the ACF6 formulation showed a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in cuticular protein (1.238 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL) as compared to control ticks (2.928 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL) but no significant difference in chitin content of treated ticks and control ticks was observed. The formulation was found safe in a rat model as no significant differences in biochemical and haematological parameters among treated and control rats were noted. Histopathological studies indicated no sign of hepatocellular necrosis and no significant changes in the weights of liver and spleen was recorded. The overall in vivo efficacy of the formulation was 85 % for experimentally infested cattle with direct mortality of more than 80 % within 96 h post-application. The lethal effect of the formulation was in the form of drying and dead ticks 1-2 d after application. The developed formulation has the potential to be adopted as an alternative tick control measure in an ecofriendly manner."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
