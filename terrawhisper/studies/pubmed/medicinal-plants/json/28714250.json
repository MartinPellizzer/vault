However, the application of essential oils as medicine is limited by its low water solubility and high vapour pressure. The objective of this study was to produce stable nanoemulsions of Thymus daenensis oil in water by preventing Ostwald ripening and phase separation.", "The antibacterial activity of bulk and emulsified essential oil against selected pathogenic bacteria including Gram-negative (Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) were investigated in the liquid and vapour phase. The optimum formulation (L2) contained 2% Tween 80 (surfactant) and 0\u00b71% lecithin (cosurfactant) had a mean droplet diameter of 131\u00a0nm. In the liquid phase, the optimized nanoemulsion exhibited good antibacterial activity against S.\u00a0pneumonia with MIC value of 0\u00b70039\u00a0mg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> . In the vapour phase, the MIC values against S.\u00a0pneumonia were similar (<7\u00b735\u00a0\u03bcL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> ) for both bulk and emulsified essential oil. However, there was no antibacterial activity in the vapour phase against H.\u00a0influenzae and P.\u00a0aeruginosa. Analysis of thymol concentration in the head space indicated that the nanoemulsion retarded the release of thymol into the vapour phase.", "These findings highlight the potential applications of nanoemulsions containing essential oils as antibacterial products.", "The results of the current study highlight the advantages of nanoemulsification for improvement of the physicochemical properties and the antibacterial activity of T.\u00a0daenensis EOs in the liquid and vapour phase for therapeutic purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry & Chemical Engineering, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaderi", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry & Chemical Engineering, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghimi", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aliahmadi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA."}], "LastName": "McClements", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry & Chemical Engineering, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafati", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lecithins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lecithins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Thymus Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28714250", "10.1111/jam.13541"]}}]}
