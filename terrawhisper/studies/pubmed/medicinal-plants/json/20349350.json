In this work, two commercially available echinacea ethanolic extracts were used as the test samples for the separation, identification, and quantification of the caffeic acid derivatives (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, cichoric acid, and caftaric acid), which are suggested to have beneficial medicinal properties. Detailed evaluations of the two primary controlling parameters for EI (electron energy and source block temperature) and GD (discharge current and pressure) sources were performed to determine optimal instrument operation conditions. The mass spectra obtained from both ion sources provide clear and simple molecular fragmentation patterns for each of the target analytes. The absolute detection limits for the caffeic acid derivatives were determined to be at subnanogram levels for both the EI and GD sources. The separation of the caffeic acid derivatives in echinacea was accomplished by reversed-phase chromatography using a C(18) column and a gradient elution system of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and methanol, with an analysis time of less than 40 min. A standard addition method was employed for the quantification of each of the caffeic acid derivatives in the tincture."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Clemson University, 102 Biosystems Research Complex, 51 New Cherry Street, Clemson, SC 29634, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Castro", "ForeName": "Joaudimir", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krishna", "ForeName": "M V Balarama", "Initials": "MV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choiniere", "ForeName": "John R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marcus", "ForeName": "R Kenneth", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equipment Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20349350", "10.1007/s00216-010-3612-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
