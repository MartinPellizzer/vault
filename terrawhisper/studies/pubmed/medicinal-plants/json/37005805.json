There is no effective control method at present. To identify the effects of three biocontrol microbes(Penicillium oxalicum QZ8, Trichoderma asperellum QZ2, and Brevibacillus amyloliquefaciens WK1) on the pathogens causing rhizome rot of P. cyrtonema, this study verified six suspected pathogens for their pathogenicity on P. cyrtonema. The result showed that Fusarium sp. HJ4, Colletotrichum sp. HJ4-1, and Phomopsis sp. HJ15 were the pathogens of rhizome rot of P. cyrtonema, and it was found for the first time that Phomopsis sp. could cause rhizome rot P. cyrtonema. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of biocontrol microbes and their secondary metabolites on three pathogens were determined by confrontation culture. The results showed that the three tested biocontrol microbes significantly inhibited the growth of three pathogens. Moreover, the secondary metabolites of T. asperellum QZ2 and B. amyloliquefaciens WK1 showed significant inhibition against the three pathogens(P&lt;0.05), and the effect of B. amyloliquefaciens WK1 sterile filtrate was significantly higher than that of high tempe-rature sterilized filtrate(P&lt;0.05). B. amyloliquefaciens WK1 produced antibacterial metabolites to inhibit the growth of pathogens, and the growth inhibition rate of its sterile filtrate against three pathogens ranged from 87.84% to 93.14%. T. asperellum QZ2 inhibited the growth of pathogens through competition and antagonism, and P. oxalicum QZ8 exerted the inhibitory effect through competition. The research provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of rhizome rot of P. cyrtonema and provides a basis for the di-sease control in other crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Meng-Qi", "Initials": "MQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Ren-Qiang", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Yin", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Meng-Li", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Jin-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ling-Shang", "Initials": "LS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Soil Contamination Bioremediation of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang A&F University Hangzhou 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qiu-Fang", "Initials": "QF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polygonatum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37005805", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20221203.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
