In this work, we developed a rapid analytical method for the quality evaluation of CHMs based on paper spray ionization (PSI)-mini-MS/MS. The quality evaluation of <i>Lygodium japonicum</i> (Thunb.) Sw. was used as an example. Following a \"multi-component\" quality evaluation strategy, nine active constituents of <i>L. japonicum</i> were selected to be used as analytes for quality control. We confirmed that the precursor-product ion information in the MS/MS spectra of each analyte in the herbal extracts was consistent with the standards. Also, we developed a mini-MS-based quantitative method for each analyte using its quantification ion. The quantitative methodology was rigorously validated using quality control samples. Finally, the quality evaluation of <i>L. japonicum</i> was carried out using the established MS/MS method combined with statistical analysis. A wide range of common quality issues with <i>L. japonicum</i> can be effectively determined, including whether it is adulterated with sand and distinguishing among different parts and species. This study demonstrates that mini-MS for quality evaluation of CHMs is feasible. Mini-MS for quality evaluation of herbal medicines will potentially have a good prospect due to its many advantages such as low cost, low power consumption, and portability in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. wrf@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. meizhang@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Shanshan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7817-0526"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. meizhang@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Wangmin", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. meizhang@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Mengdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. meizhang@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Junling", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. wrf@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rufeng", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3877-0209"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 102488, China. meizhang@bucm.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tracheophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36637180", "10.1039/d2ay01769e"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
