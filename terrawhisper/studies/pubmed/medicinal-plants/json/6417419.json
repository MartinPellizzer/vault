{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["This paper presents the results of an investigation of Asoka Aristha, an indigenous medicine used in rural Sri Lanka for menstrual disorders. This investigation was part of a broader evaluation of ayurvedic drugs aimed at establishing the botanic identity of drug ingredients, establishing possible modes of action, and identifying the chemical constituents responsible for the drug effects. It is projected that the results of this research can be used to standardize ayurvedic drugs and optimize the quality and production procedures. Asoka Aristha, a fermented potion composed largely of Asoka bark, is produced on a large scale by the state-owned Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation. It has been indicated for women in cases of menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, leukorrhea, primary amenorrhea, general menstrual disorders, and skin disorders. 3 types of experiments are projected to evaluate the biologic activity of Asoka Aristha: measurement of the occurrence of cornification of the uterus epithelium in hypophysectomized rats after administration of the drug to determine the estrogenic mode of action, in vitro measurement of the direct uterine activity of the drug to determinme the oxytocic effect, and testing of the inhibiting properties of the drug in prostaglandin synthetase enzyme reactions in vitro. Experiments carried out on rat uteri so far seem to rule out the mechanism based on oxytocic action. It is urged that clinical trials on the therapeutic effect of Asoka Aristha be carried out in Sri Lanka."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["021466", "00133182"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Drugs", "Economic Factors", "Evaluation", "Genital Effects, Female", "Health", "Health Services", "Indigenous Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Menstruation Disorders", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Southern Asia", "Sri Lanka", "Technology", "Treatment", "Urogenital Effects"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6417419", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1984", "Month": "01", "Day": "27"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "29"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0378-8741", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "8", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Journal of ethnopharmacology", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Ethnopharmacol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Evaluation of Asoka Aristha, an indigenous medicine in Sri Lanka.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "313", "EndPage": "320", "MedlinePgn": "313-20"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Middelkoop", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Labadie", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxytocics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Menstruation Disturbances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxytocics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6417419", "10.1016/0378-8741(83)90068-5", "0378-8741(83)90068-5"]}}]}
