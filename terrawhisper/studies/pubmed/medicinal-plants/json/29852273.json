Accumulation of the latter compounds is often regulated by transcriptional activation of the biosynthesis pathway genes by the phytohormone jasmonate-isoleucine. Here, we used our recently developed flower petal transformation method in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus to shed light on the complex regulatory mechanisms steering the jasmonate-modulated biosynthesis of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), to which the anti-cancer compounds vinblastine and vincristine belong. By combinatorial overexpression of the transcriptional activators BIS1, ORCA3 and MYC2a, we provide an unprecedented insight into the modular transcriptional control of MIA biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that the expression of an engineered de-repressed MYC2a triggers a tremendous reprogramming of the MIA pathway, finally leading to massively increased accumulation of at least 23 MIAs. The current study unveils an innovative approach for future metabolic engineering efforts for the production of valuable bioactive plant compounds in non-model plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 International Metabolic Engineering Society.
