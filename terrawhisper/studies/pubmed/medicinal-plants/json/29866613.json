Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were detected by immunohistochemistry and rotenone-exposure days necessary to induce PD symptoms were recorded. To probe one likely mechanism of the formulas, echinacoside (ECH) concentrations of all seven recipes were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and related to number of TH-positive neurons.", "The data showed that recipe 4 (DH:RCR:SZY:NX\u202f=\u202f1:1:1:1) and recipe 7 (DH:RCR:SZY:NX\u202f=\u202f7:5:3:1) partially reversed rotenone-induced death of TH-positive neurons in the SNpc and significantly increased rotenone-exposed days compared with model group. Pharmacologically, there was not a strong correlation between ECH concentration and TH-positive neurons.", "The investigated formulations of Chinese herbs had neuroprotective effects against PD models, and the neuroprotective effects were weakly related to the proportion of key herbs.
