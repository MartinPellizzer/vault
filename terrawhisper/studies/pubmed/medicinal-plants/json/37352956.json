In this research, we have reported a green synthesis of a bi-metallic nanocomposite of nickel and zinc using an aqueous extract of Citrus sinensis in the presence of chitosan (Ni/Zn@orange/chitosan). The nanocomposite was characterized using different techniques. We have examined various applications for Ni/Zn@orange/chitosan. The NPs were manufactured in spherical morphology with a particle range size of 17.34-90.51\u00a0nm. Ni/Zn@orange/chitosan showed an acceptable ability to remove dyes of Congo red and methyl orange from an aqueous solution after 80\u00a0min furthermore, it uptaking the drug mefenamic acid from a solution. Ni/Zn@orange/chitosan also exhibited great photocatalytic activity in synthesizing benzimidazole using benzyl alcohol and o-phenylenediamine. Ni/Zn@orange/chitosan was found as a potent electrochemical sensor to determine glucose. In the molecular and cellular section of the current research, the cells with composite nanoparticles were studied by MTT way about the anti-breast adenocarcinoma potentials malignant cell lines. The IC<sub>50</sub> of composite nanoparticles were 320, 460, 328, 500, 325, 379, 350, and 396\u00a0\u03bcg/mL concering RBA, NMU, SK-BR-3, CAMA-1, MCF7, AU565, MDA-MB-468, and Hs 281.T breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, respectively. The results revealed the newly synthesized nanocomposite is a potent photocatalyst, dye pollution removal agent, and an acceptable new drug to treat breast cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
