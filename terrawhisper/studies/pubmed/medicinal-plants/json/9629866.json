AYB was cleaned, dehulled, milled and fermented for 24 hours by the natural microflora present in the legume flour. Maize was fermented for 48 hours. A ratio of 70:30 (protein basis) of AYB: maize was used to formulate the blends. Vegetable milks were prepared from the AYB flours and their maize blends. Standard assay techniques were used to evaluate the milks for proximate, mineral, ascorbate and antinutrient composition. The protein contents of the milks (1.47-2.06 percent) was comparable to soymilk (2.04 percent) and bambara groundnut milk (2.00 percent). The milks contained appreciable quantities of carbohydrate and minerals tested. The milk blends had traces of ascorbate and contained higher phosphorus than the milks from the AYB flours. The fermented milk blend had higher protein, ash and sugar levels and lower phytate and stachyose levels compared to non-fermented blend. Raffinose was reduced to trace levels in the fermented milks. The milks were appetizing. The fermented milk blend was more acceptable than others and was preferred in terms of flavor and color. It had greater advantages over the other vegetable milks evaluated in terms of zinc, phosphorus and stachyose levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Home Science and Nutrition, University of Nigeria, Nsukka."}], "LastName": "Nnam", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Science. 1986 Jun 13;232(4756):1379-84", "ArticleIdList": ["17828913"]}, {"Citation": "Int J Food Microbiol. 1988 Feb;6(1):67-79", "ArticleIdList": ["2856346"]}, {"Citation": "J Sci Food Agric. 1974 Aug;25(8):919-22", "ArticleIdList": ["4411930"]}, {"Citation": "J Sci Food Agric. 1972 Jan;23(1):101-11", "ArticleIdList": ["5028296"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9629866", "10.1023/a:1007918011504"]}}]}
