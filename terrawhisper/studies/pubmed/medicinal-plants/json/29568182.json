Antioxidant activity was measured using 2,2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), nitric oxide, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays.", "Methanol had the highest extraction yield (21.50%) followed by aqueous (10.87%). Acetone and ethanol yielded 6.87% and 4.3%, respectively. However, acetone and ethanol extracts had more phenolic content (218.6 \u00b1 3.38 and 214.8 \u00b1 3.56 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g, respectively) that were significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.05) than the methanol and aqueous extracts (203.8 \u00b1 1.95 and 175.5 \u00b1 0.32 mg GAE/mg, respectively). Acetone extract also had more flavonoid and proanthocyanidin contents (679.8 \u00b1 6.26 mg quercetin equivalent/g and 645.7 \u00b1 6.35 mg catechin equivalent/g, respectively) that were significantly higher than the other solvent extracts (<i>P</i> < 0.05). All the solvent fractions showed great antioxidant activities with the acetone fraction having the highest capacity based on ABTS, DPPH, and TAC assays (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC<sub>50</sub>] = <5 \u03bcg/mL, 24.5 \u03bcg/mL, and 85 \u03bcg/mL respectively). The methanol extract however had FRAP and nitric oxide antioxidant activities (IC<sub>50</sub> = 302 \u03bcg/mL and < 25 \u03bcg/mL respectively).", "The findings of this study provide evidence that <i>P. capitata</i> has potential as a natural source of antioxidant with acetone showing to be the best extractant of the polyphenolics with corresponding higher antioxidant activities.", "The study investigated the <i>in vitro</i> polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities of the mistletoe; <i>Phragmanthera capitata</i>, extracted with different solventsThe resultant outcome of the study showed that while methanol had more yield from the extraction, the highest polyphenolic contents was observed in the acetone extractThe acetone extract also showed the highest antioxidant activity in most of the assaysThere was a positive correlation between the polyphenolics and the antioxidant activities: Higher polyphenol content resulted in a better antioxidant activityIf extracting this plant for preparatory works only, methanol would be preferred, but if it were for bioassay screening, acetone will be the solvent of choice. <b>Abbreviations Used:</b> DPPH: 2, 2diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)ABTS: 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)FRAP: Ferric reducing antioxidant powerTAC: Total antioxidant capacityGAE: Gallic acid equivalentQE: Quercetin equivalentCE: Catechin equivalentBHT: Butylated hydroxyl toluene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Ohikhena", "ForeName": "Franklin Uangbaoje", "Initials": "FU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Wintola", "ForeName": "Olubunmi Abosede", "Initials": "OA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "Anthony Jide", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacognosy Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101558769", "ISSNLinking": "0974-8490"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Afolabi C, Akinmoladun E, Ibukun O, Emmanuel A, Obuotor EM.
