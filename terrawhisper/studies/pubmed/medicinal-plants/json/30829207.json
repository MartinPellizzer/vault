Therefore, the present study conducted to evaluate the liver protective and oxidative stress reducing activities of methanolic (MFEt) and aqueous methanolic fruits (AqMFEt) extracts of Withania coagulans against CCl4-induced liver damage in rats. These fruits extracts in oral doses of 800 mg/kg were found effective in their respective test groups in decreasing weight loss, maintaining hepatic membrane integrity, biosynthetic and conjugative abilities by improving liver and bile duct specific enzymes (alanine and aspartate transferases, alkaline phosphatase, \u03b3-glutamyltranstransferase), total protein and bilirubin profiles, uric acid levels plus uplifting the efficacy of hepatic antioxidant enzymes and protein by minimizing lipid peroxidation. All these beneficial effects confirmed by observing normal anatomical features of liver tissues in test groups. Total phenolic compounds were found high in AqMFEt. Interestingly, for the first time, gallic acid and rutin are identified and quantified in these extracts and thought to improve hepatoprotective potential of W. coagulans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qureshi", "ForeName": "Shamim Akhtar", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan / Department of Biochemistry, Sir Syed College of Medical Sciences for Girls, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jahan", "ForeName": "Musarrat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Lateef", "ForeName": "Tooba", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Forman Christian College, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Dildar", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rais", "ForeName": "Sumera", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Dow Medical College, Dow University of Health Science, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Azmi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Bilal", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RFM9X3LJ49", "NameOfSubstance": "Bilirubin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bilirubin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30829207"]}}]}
