A variety of antimicrobial compounds and molecules such as bacteriocin are produced by these useful bacteria to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbes in the food products. This paper aims to examine the isolation of <i>Lactobacillus</i> from local dairies as well as to determine their inhibition effect against a number of pathogens, such as two fungi: <i>Penicillium notatum</i> and <i>Aspergillus fulvous</i>.", "Twelve <i>Lactobacillus</i> isolates from several local dairies. After initial dilution (10<sup>-1</sup>-10<sup>-3</sup>) and culture on the setting, de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe-agar, the isolates were recognized and separated by phenotypic characteristics and biochemical; then their antifungal effect was examined by two methods.", "Having separated eight <i>Lactobacillus</i> isolates, about 70% of the isolates have shown the inhabiting areas of antifungus on the agar-based setting, but two species <i>Lactobacillus</i> alimentarius and <i>Lactobacillus</i> delbrueckii have indicated a significant antifungal effect against <i>P. notatum</i> and <i>A. fulvous</i>. Except bacteriocin, lactic acid, and acetic acid, the inhibitor substance is produced by these bacteria.", "Given the vitality of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in human health, recognition and isolation of the species producing compound in antagonist to the pathogens existing in the food products can be a helpful and effective step toward maintaining the valuable native <i>Lactobacillus</i> and using them in the dairy industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahwaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karami", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahwaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roayaei", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahwaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zahedi", "ForeName": "Elnaz", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahmani", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahmoodnia", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Ahwaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamzavi", "ForeName": "Hosna", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Int J Pharm Investig", "NlmUniqueID": "101580610", "ISSNLinking": "2230-9713"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Amin A, Jorfi M, Khosravi DA, Samarbaf zadeh RA, Faraj zadeh Sheikh A.
