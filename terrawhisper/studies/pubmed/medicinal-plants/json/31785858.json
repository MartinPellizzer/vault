All these compounds are bicyclic polyketides, with compound 1 contains unusual hemiketal moiety at C-5 and compounds 2-14 having ketone group at C-1 and double bond at C-5(6). The structures and absolute configurations of the new compounds were established by spectroscopic analysis, X-ray crystal diffraction, modified Mosher's method, and ECD calculation. The absolute configurations of the known compounds 9, 10, and 12 were determined by X-ray crystal diffractions for the first time. The antimicrobial activities against human pathogen, marine-derived aquatic bacteria, and plant-pathogenic fungi of compounds 1-14 were evaluated, and compound 1 showed remarkable activity against aquatic pathogen Vibrio alginolyticus with MIC value 1\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, which is as active as that of the positive control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
