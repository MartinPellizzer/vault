Methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is responsible for most of its cases (more than 50%). Since MRSA is resistant to many treatments, it is accompanied by high costs and numerous complications, necessitating more effective new treatments. Recently, development of gelatin nanoparticles have attracted the attention of scientists of biomedicine to itself, and have been utilized as a delivery vehicle for antibiotics because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and cost-effectiveness. Promising results have been reported with gelatin modification and combinations with chemical agents. Although these findings have been suggested that gelatin has the potential to be a suitable option for continuous release of antibiotics in osteomyelitis and septic arthritis treatment, they still have not become routine in clinical practices. The most deliver antibiotic using gelatin-derived composites is vancomycin which is showed the good efficacy. To date, a number of pre-clinical studies evaluated the utility of gelatin-based composites in the management of osteomyelitis. Gelatin-based composites were found to have satisfactory performance in the control of infection, as well as the promotion of bone defect repair in chronic osteomyelitis models. This review summarized the available evidence which provides a new insight into gelatin-derived composites with controlled release of antibiotics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Sherafati Chaleshtori, Marzhoseyni, Saeedi, Azar Bahadori, Mollazadeh, Pourghadamyari, Sajadimoghadam, Abbaszadeh\u2010Goudarzi, Moradi Hasan-Abad and Sharafati Chaleshtori."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedics, Faculty of Medicine, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sherafati Chaleshtori", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Marzhoseyni", "ForeName": "Zeynab", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Islamic Azad University, North Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saeedi", "ForeName": "Negin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Parand Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azar Bahadori", "ForeName": "Rosita", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourghadamyari", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sajadimoghadam", "ForeName": "Esmaeil", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Sabzevar University of Medical Science, Sabzevar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbaszadeh-Goudarzi", "ForeName": "Kazem", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Autoimmune Diseases Research Center, Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradi Hasan-Abad", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharafati Chaleshtori", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Mol Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "101653173", "ISSNLinking": "2296-889X"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "24"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39139812", "PMC11319135", "10.3389/fmolb.2024.1412325", "1412325"]}}]}
