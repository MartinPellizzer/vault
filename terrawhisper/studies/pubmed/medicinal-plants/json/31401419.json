In this study, the antioxidant activity and browning behaviour of free and bound phenolic fractions of mango, apple, orange and banana peelings microwave-blanched at 720\u202fW for 1, 3 and 5\u202fmin were determined. The fractions were equally analyzed for their phenolic content and composition. Generally, increased microwave blanching was accompanied by a significant increase of total phenolics content in free and bound fractions. Increased antioxidant activities at 3 and 5\u202fmin of blanching varied with the type of fruit peelings. Browning rates decreased with microwave blanching time except in the case of apple peelings. Epicatechin, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, p-coumaric acid and gallic acid were identified in fruit peelings. Generally, microwave blanching for 3 or 5\u202fmin was found to preserve antioxidant activities and reduce the browning rate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
