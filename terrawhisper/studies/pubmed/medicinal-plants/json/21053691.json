Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are considered key pathogens in periodontitis. The treatment consists of oral hygiene education, instrumentation for removal of calculus (scaling), chemotherapy and periodontal surgery. Several agents are commercially available; these chemicals can alter oral microbiota and have undesirable side-effects such as vomiting, diarrhea and tooth staining. Hence, the search for alternative products continues and natural phytochemicals isolated from plants used as traditional medicine and the use of biomaterials are considered good alternatives. Chitosan and pullulan are polymers that have been proposed due to their favorable properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and adhesion ability. They can be used as local delivery systems of active principles of plant extracts. Thymus vulgaris, Matricaria chamomilla, Croton lechleri, Calendula officinalis L. and Juliana adstringens Schl. are known to have medicinal activity, and they are used in Mexican traditional medicine. Their extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, using agar diffusion and microdilution methods. The antimicrobial activity of films from biopolymers with plant extracts was evaluated by measuring the zones of inhibition against the tested organisms. The aim of this study was to develop bioadhesive films from chitosan and pullulan with added plant extracts and determine the antimicrobial activity of films against periodontal pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biological Science, Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon, M\u00e9xico."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodriguez-Garcia", "ForeName": "Aida", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Galan-Wong", "ForeName": "Luis J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arevalo-Ni\u00f1o", "ForeName": "Katiushka", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Argentina", "MedlineTA": "Acta Odontol Latinoam", "NlmUniqueID": "8610218", "ISSNLinking": "0326-4815"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biopolymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8ZQ0AYU1TT", "NameOfSubstance": "pullulan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biopolymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pasteurella"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Porphyromonas gingivalis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21053691"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
