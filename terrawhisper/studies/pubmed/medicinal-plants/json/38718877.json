On the other hand, olanzapine, as an antipsychotic, can induce antidepressant and antipsychotic effects. Also, olanzapine may improve cognitive functions. Both CUMS and olanzapine can also affect the expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and synaptophysin, the molecular factors involved in synaptic function, and learning and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of olanzapine on locomotor activity (using open field test), pain threshold (using hot plate), depressive-like behavior (using forced swim test), spatial learning and memory (using Morris water maze), and BDNF and synaptophysin hippocampal expression (using real-time PCR) in both male and female CUMS rats. CUMS was performed for three consecutive weeks. Olanzapine was also injected intraperitoneally at the dose of 5\u202fmg/kg. Our data showed that olanzapine can reverse the effects of CUMS on behavioral functions and BDNF and synaptophysin expression levels in the hippocampus of both males and females. It was also shown that olanzapine effects on spatial memory, pain perception, and BDNF and synaptophysin level were stronger in females than males. In conclusion, we suggested that the therapeutic effects of olanzapine in CUMS rats may be closely related to the function of BDNF and synaptophysin. Also, the therapeutic effects of olanzapine may be stronger in females. Therefore, and for the first time, we showed that there may be a sex difference in the effects of olanzapine on behavioral and molecular changes following CUMS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
