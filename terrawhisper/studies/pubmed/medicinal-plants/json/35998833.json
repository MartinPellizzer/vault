The structures of them were elucidated based on 1D, 2D-NMR experiments and HRESIMS. The absolute configurations of vernodalidimer I-K and M-T were determined by comparison of their experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. Cytotoxicity of the isolates against HCT-15, PC-3, A549, and HeLa cell lines were tested. Vernodalidimer K and Q exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against HCT-15\u00a0cell line with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0\u03bcM and 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
