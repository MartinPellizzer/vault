The LD50 of the water soluble portion of alcoholic extracts of horse-chestnut seeds (for hamsters and chicks) and of dried, powdered seeds (chicks only) was determined. The LD50 for a single dose of extract from horse-chestnut seeds was 10.6 mg/g of body weight for chicks and 10.7 mg/g of body weight for hamsters. The LD50 for chicks given 2 consecutive daily doses of horse-chestnut seed was 6.5 mg/g. Toxic signs included depression, muscular incoordination, paralysis, coma, and death. Extracts of seeds of Ohio buckeye were nontoxic to chicks and hamsters when fed at 80 mg/g. One of 5 hamsters died after dosing for 5 days with 80 mg/g of extract of seeds of yellow buckeye/g."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Olsen", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Vet Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0375011", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9645"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Poultry Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Rodent Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6538769"]}}]}
