Moreover, 17 known constituents of them were identified in the plants of genus Smilax for the first time, and 16 were identified in the plant Smilax glabra Roxb. for the first time. Of 161 known compounds, 84 constituents (including isomers) have been reported to have 17 types of pharmacological activities, covering all known pharmacological activities of SGR; among these 84 bioactive constituents, six were found in the plants of genus Smilax for the first time and five were found in S.\u00a0glabra for the first time, which are new bioactive constituents found in the plants of genus Smilax and the plant S.\u00a0glabra, respectively.", "The results provide further information on the chemical composition of SGR, laying the foundation for the elucidation of the pharmacodynamic substances of SGR."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6497-7513"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Mongolian Medicine, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, China."}], "LastName": "Gegentana"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Ethnic Medicinal Resources Protection and Utilization Key Laboratory of National Ethnic Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Chengdu, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yan-Fei", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hong-Fu", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Drug Evaluation, National Medical Products Administration, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Shang", "ForeName": "Ming-Ying", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guang-Xue", "Initials": "GX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yao-Li", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Biology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, Peking University, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Shao-Qing", "Initials": "SQ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "16G40075", "Agency": "Beijing Natural Science Foundation", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "82173968", "Agency": "the National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2019ZX09201004", "Agency": "the National Science and Technology Major Project for Significant New Drugs Developmen", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Mongolian Pharmacy \"First-Class Discipline\" Young Teachers' Innovation Ability Improvement Project of Inner Mongolia Medical University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Smilax"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Liang Y, Huang N, Yang QL.
