But proper standardization is necessary for their integration into mainstream medicine. One such well-known formulation is <i>Pushyanuga Churna</i>. As safety and efficacy of a multiherbal formulation is dependent on the authenticity of the ingredients used, chromatographic techniques play a significant role in the quality control of complex herbal medicines. <i>Objective:</i> In the current research, marker-based standardization of <i>Pushyanuga Churna</i> using validated HPTLC and HPLC methods have been established. <i>Methods: Pushyanuga Churna</i> was prepared in-house using authentic ingredients. Pharmacologically active biomarkers quercetin and berberine were simultaneously estimated using validated HPTLC and HPLC methods. Chromatographic fingerprints were developed for the formulation along with all the ingredients that can be used as tools to identify <i>Pushyanuga Churna. Results:</i> In-house formulation and <i>Patanjali</i> (marketed formulation) were observed to be rich in both markers. Quercetin was found to be more abundant than berberine in the ingredients. The deviation of marker content in marketed formulations can be attributed to variation in the ingredients used in the preparation. <i>Conclusions:</i> The routine use of such scientifically accepted methods will help in establishing the quality of the formulation and help in building confidence in traditional medicine. <i>Highlights:</i> The study highlights evaluation of biomarkers from the formulation and its ingredients as an important method to ensure the batch to batch consistency in quality of the formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal Research Laboratory, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College, Matunga, Mumbai, India 400019."}], "LastName": "Shailajan", "ForeName": "Sunita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal Research Laboratory, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College, Matunga, Mumbai, India 400019."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Yugandhara", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal Research Laboratory, Ramnarain Ruia Autonomous College, Matunga, Mumbai, India 400019."}], "LastName": "Joshi", "ForeName": "Mayuresh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Training & Research in Interdisciplinary Sciences, Sion-Koliwada, Mumbai, India 400028."}], "LastName": "Menon", "ForeName": "Sasikumar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Advanced Training & Research in Interdisciplinary Sciences, Sion-Koliwada, Mumbai, India 400028."}], "LastName": "Mhatre", "ForeName": "Mandar", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30563588", "10.5740/jaoacint.18-0380"]}}]}
