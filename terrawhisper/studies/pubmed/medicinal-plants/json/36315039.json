As these products have an increasingly important position in healthcare systems worldwide, a detailed product quality assessment is of crucial importance. For the quality evaluation of commercial herbal products, a wide range of methods were used, from simpler, quicker, and cost-effective HPTLC, to hyphenated methods with MS or NMR, where more precise quantification or specific structural information is required. Additionally, most of the methods have been coupled with chemometric tools, such as PCA, or PDA, for the multivariate analysis of the high amount of data generated by chromatograms, electropherograms or spectra. The chemical methods have revealed the widespread presence of low or variable quality herbal products in the marketplace. The majority of analytical investigations present major, qualitative and quantitative, inter-product variations of their chemical composition, ranging from missing ingredients, to strikingly and unnaturally high concentrations of some compounds. Moreover, the inter-batch quality variations were frequently reported, as well as the presence of some undesirable substances. The chemical analysis of herbal products is a vital component to raise the overall awareness of quality in the herbal market and generate a quality driven approach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8192-5544"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\"Stejarul\" Research Centre for Biological Sciences, National Institute of Research and Development for Biological Sciences, Piatra Neamt, Romania."}], "LastName": "Ichim", "ForeName": "Mihael Cristin", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy Group, Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Scotti", "ForeName": "Francesca", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Optimal Health, School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Booker", "ForeName": "Anthony", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36315039", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2140120"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
