Screening of 16 patients for phagocytic and microbicidal activity of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) revealed a significant depression (21.2 +/- 3.7% phagocytosis and 20.85 +/- 4.5% intracellular killing) of these functions, as compared to normal values (30.37 +/- 5.1% and 26.41 +/- 4.3% respectively). An animal model of cholestasis was also established, using rats, in which a significant depression of activity of PMN and peritoneal macrophages was observed. These cellular abnormalities were found to precede and predispose to infection. The rats also showed an increased susceptibility to Escherichia coli infection (mortality rate 77.78%). A defect was detected in their serum responsible for depressing the function of phagocytic cells. An attempt was made to improve this immunosuppression by treating the rats with water extract of T. cordifolia 100 mg/kg for 7 days, following development of cholestasis. The extract improved the cellular immune functions. Mortality rate following Esch. coli infection was significantly reduced to 16.67 per cent. This study showed that cholestasis results in immunosuppression and therefore indicates the need for an immunomodulator in management of obstructive jaundice. The plant T. cordifolia seems to meet this need by consolidating host defence mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rege", "ForeName": "N N", "Initials": "NN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nazareth", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bapat", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dahanukar", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholestasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2697692"]}}]}
