This species is currently being developed as a medicinal herb used to treat nephritis in China and an oilseed crop for biofuel production (Roque et al.2012). In November 2020, stunt and wilt symptoms were observed on above ground parts and swollen club-shaped galls were observed on the roots of T. arvense in most of the Chinese cabbage growing area in Kangding (30\u00b003'\"N,102\u00b002'\"E), Sichuan Province of China. The average disease incidence of swollen roots on T. arvense was 91.2% ( n=80). To identify the causal agent of this disease, the swollen roots of T. arvense were collected, crushed and observed under microscope (Fei et al.2017). Abundant resting spores were found in the root galls, which were spherical and 2.0 to 3.1 \u03bcm in diameter with an average length of 2.7 nm (n=100). The healthy roots and the root galls of T. arvense plants were further evaluated by PCR with P. brassicae-specific primers TC2F/TC2R (Cao et al. 2007). The results showed that a DNA fragment with an estimated size of 520 bp, as expected for that of P. brassicae, was consistently amplified in diseased roots, No PCR amplification occurred in the healthy roots with the TC2F/TC2R primers. Blast analysis of the 520 bp segment (GenBankMZ040496) showed the highest identity with the sequence of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of P. brassicae (GenBankMH762161, 97.7%, E value=0). These results confirmed that the pathogen in the galled roots of T. arvense was P. brassicae. The pathogenicity of isolated P. brassicae was tested on both T. arvense and Chinese cabbage (B. campestris ssp. pekinensis). Resting spores were isolated from the diseased roots (Castlkbury et al. 1994) of T. arvense and suspended in Hoagland's solution to the final concentration of 1 \u00d7 107 spores per milliliter. Fifteen plastic pots (10 cm bottom diameter, 16 cm upper diameter, 13 cm high) were filled with soil (1 kg per pot) that was sterilized twice with high-temperature (121\u2103), high pressure (19 PSI) for 1.5 hours with a time interval of 2 days between. Inoculated pots received 100 mL spore suspension each. Fifteen control pots with sterilized field soil were treated with 100 mL Hoagland's solution each. Seeds of T. arvense and B. campestris were pre-germinated at 20\u00b0C on moist filter paper for 7 days and transplanted into the pots, five seedlings each and five pots per treatment. The pots were maintained in a greenhouse with 16 hours photoperiod at 24\u00b0C/16\u00b0C day/night temperature. After 7 weeks, plants in each pot were uprooted and the roots cleaned in running water and inspected for clubroot symptoms. Plants of T. arvense and Chinese cabbage in pots inoculated with resting spores showed clubroot symptoms while no disease symptoms were observed on any control plants. The disease incidence rate was 95.4% on T. arvense and 81.2% on B. campestris. Therefore, it was confirmed that P. brassicae could cause clubroot disease on T. arvense. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of clubroot disease on T. arvense in China. This finding is helpful for the management of clubroot on herbs and plants of biological origin in the cruciferous family."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Plant Protection, Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chengdu, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Integrated Pest Management on Crops in Southwest, Ministry of Agriculture, P.
