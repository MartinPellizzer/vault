The plasma concentration of paeoniflorin after intravenous administration at the doses of 0.5, 2.0 and 5.0 mg kg-1 rapidly decreased, simulated by a biexponential curve, with mean terminal half-lives of 11.0, 9.9 and 12.6 min, respectively. The Vdss values were 0.332, 0. 384 and 0.423 L kg-1 and the CLtot values were 26.1, 31.2 and 30.3 mL min-1 kg-1 at each dose. When given orally at the same doses, the absolute bioavailability values (F) determined by the AUC were 0.032, 0.033 and 0.038, respectively. The cumulative urinary and faecal excretions of paeoniflorin at the dose of 5 mg kg-1 after intravenous administration were 50.5 and 0.22% of the dose within 72 h, and 1.0 and 0.08% of the dose after oral administration within 48 h, respectively. Cumulative biliary excretion after intravenous or oral administration at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 was 6.9 and 1.3% of the dose within 24 h, respectively. The total CLR and CLB value after intravenous dosing was less than the CLtot value. These findings suggest that paeoniflorin is metabolized in other organs as well as in the liver. We conclude that paeoniflorin absorbed is excreted mainly in urine, it has a low bioavailability and the metabolites may be involved in the pharmacological action of Paeony root."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Safety and Metabolism Department, Tsumura Central Research Laboratories, Tsumura & Co., Ibaraki, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takeda", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Isono", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wakui", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsuzaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amagaya", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maruno", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21AIQ4EV64", "NameOfSubstance": "peoniflorin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8932691", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1995.tb03293.x"]}}]}
