The ability of scavenging free radicals was measured by DPPH reduction spectrophotometric assay. The reducing potential towards transition metals was tested by phosphomolybdenum method and the inhibition of lipid oxidation was tested by Fe/ascorbate system with photometric TBARS detection. All studied herbs exposed strong antioxidant capability, but the results were different for each species depending on the applied test. In DPPH scavenging the order from strongest to the weakest was: Leonurus cardiaca, Lamium album, Marrubium vulgare, Stachys officinalis, Lamium purpureum, Galeopsis speciosa. With phosphomolybdenum method the extract of S. officinalis was the strongest in both 40 degrees Celsius and 90 degrees Celsius but other species acted differently in both temperatures. In lipid peroxidation assay, the maximum inhibition of 78% was reached by S. officinalis and M. vulgare, whereas for both Lamium sp. and L. cardiaca slightly exceeded 70% and for G. speciosa reached 65%. The observed differences indicate the complexity of involved mechanisms and support the necessity of combining several assays in studying the antioxidant potential of medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Botany, Medical University in Wroc\u0142aw, Al.
