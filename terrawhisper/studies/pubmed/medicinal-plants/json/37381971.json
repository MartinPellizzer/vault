Chinese medicinal plant resources are the foundation for new varieties breeding, and the plant variety rights(PVP) are of great significance for the protection and development of germplasm resources. However, most Chinese medicinal plants do not have a distinctness, uniformity, and stability(DUS) testing guideline. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs has put 191 plant species(genera) on protection lists, of which only 30 are medicinal species(genera). At the same time, only 29 of 293 species(genera) plants in the Protection List of New Plant Varieties of the People's Republic of China(Forest and Grass) belong to Chinese medicinal plants. The number of PVP applications and authorization of Chinese medicinal plants is rare, and the composition of variety is unreasonable. Up to now, 29 species(genera) of DUS test guidelines for Chinese medicinal plants have been developed. Some basic problems in the breeding of new varieties of Chinese medicinal plants have appeared, such as the small number of new varieties and insufficient utilization of Chinese medicinal plant resources. This paper reviewed the current situation of breeding of new varieties of Chinese medicinal plants and the research progress of DUS test guidelines in China and discussed the application of biotechnology in the field of Chinese medicinal plant breeding and the existing problems in DUS testing. This paper guides the further application of DUS to protect and utilize the germplasm resources of Chinese medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Cai", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334213, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334213, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Ming", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Yang", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiu-Zhi", "Initials": "XZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yue-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334213, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Bin-Bin", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334213, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zi-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China Dexing Research and Training Center of Chinese Medical Sciences Dexing 334213, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sheng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37381971", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20230214.103"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
