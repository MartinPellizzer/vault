(Talinaceae) is a medicinal species that is widely distributed throughout Brazil. Popularly known as \"major-gomes,\" the species is used in folk medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.", "To evaluate the effect of an ethanolic extract of T. paniculatum (EETP) in rats with renovascular hypertension and heart failure and determine its chemical composition.", "First, EETP was obtained, and its chemical profile was analyzed by LC-DAD-MS. The acute toxicity was evaluated in female Wistar rats. The model of renovascular hypertension was established in male Wistar rats by combining the Goldblatt 2K1C method and intraperitoneal doxorubicin administration for 6 weeks. The animals were then treated daily with EETP (30, 100, and 300\u00a0mg/kg) or metoprolol (25\u00a0mg/kg) by gavage for 28 days. The negative control group was treated with vehicle (filtered water). The sham group consisted of animals that were not subjected to 2K1C or cardiotoxicity and were treated with vehicle. Renal function was evaluated on days 1, 14, and 28. At the end of treatment, the electrocardiographic profile, blood pressure, and mesenteric vascular reactivity were investigated. Serum urea, creatinine, angiotensin converting enzyme, nitrotyrosine, malondialdehyde, nitrite, aldosterone, and sodium and potassium levels were measured. The heart, aorta artery, liver, and right kidney were collected, weighed, and processed for histopathological analysis. Cardiac chambers also underwent morphometric analysis.", "No signs of toxicity were observed in female Wistar rats. Thirty-two compounds were annotated from EETP, including flavonoids, chlorogenic acids, and saponins. EETP treatment resulted in a significant cardiorenal-protective response, normalizing electrocardiographic and hemodynamic alterations, and preventing ventricle remodeling. These effects were associated with serum antioxidant activity and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.", "The present study demonstrated that EETP may exert cardioprotective effects through serum antioxidant activity and ACE inhibition, preventing alterations of hemodynamic and endothelial function, and reducing damage to cardiac structure. Thus, EETP, especially at the 100 and 300\u00a0mg/kg doses, may be useful for preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in hypertensive patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
