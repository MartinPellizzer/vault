The quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation determined by these methods was estimated to be 0.16 by comparison with the known quantum yields of standard singlet oxygen sensitizers. Singlet oxygen was formed on illumination of reaction centers under conditions that lead to formation of the triplet state of the primary electron donor, P680. Experiments with deuterated buffer and active oxygen scavengers indicated that singlet oxygen was the only active oxygen species produced by this reaction. Neither azide nor histidine, which are scavengers of singlet oxygen, protected against photobleaching of the chlorophyll of reaction centers that occurs concomitantly with singlet oxygen formation, suggesting that bleaching involves singlet oxygen generated within the protein matrix of the complex. Singlet oxygen sensitized exogenously by rose bengal (when excited specifically at 550 nm) was also found to bleach reaction center chlorophyll in a manner similar to the intrinsic mechanism. We conclude that singlet oxygen formed within the hydrophobic interior of the reaction center attacks the chlorophylls of P680, and presumably also amino acids in the vicinity, and that only the singlet oxygen that escapes to the medium is affected by added scavengers or deuterated medium. These experiments extend our earlier report of the detection of singlet oxygen by its luminescence at 1270 nm when isolated photosystem II reaction centers are illuminated (Macpherson, A. N., Telfer, A., Barber, J., and Truscott, T. G. (1993) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1143, 301-309). Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that production of singlet oxygen underlies the vulnerability of photosystem II to photodamage and hence necessitates the rapid turnover of the D1 protein of the reaction center."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wolfson Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, London, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Telfer", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bishop", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barber", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "138-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrosodimethylaniline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17778-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Singlet Oxygen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosystem II Protein Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Singlet Oxygen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8175754", "S0021-9258(17)36825-4"]}}]}
