Limited natural accessibility and poor oral bioavailability caused major hurdles in the curcumin-based drug development process. We report the first successful testimony of curcumin and its glucoside synthesis in Atropa belladonna hairy roots (HR) through metabolic engineering. Re-routing the inherent biosynthetic precursors of the phenylpropanoid pathway of A. belladonna by heterologous expression of key curcumin biosynthetic pathway genes (i.e., Diketide-CoA synthase-DCS and Curcumin synthase-CURS3) and glucosyltransferase gene (CaUGT2) resulted in the production of curcumin and its glucoside in HR clones. Under shake-flask cultivation, the PGD2-HR1clone bearing DCS/ CURS3 genes showed the maximum curcumin yield (180.62 \u00b1 4.7 \u03bcg/g DW), while the highest content of curcumin monoglucoside (32.63 \u00b1 2.27 \u03bcg/g DW) along with curcumin (67.89 \u00b1 2.56 \u03bcg/g DW) were noted in the PGD3-HR3 clone co-expressing DCS/CURS3 and CaUGT2 genes. Bioreactor up-scaling showed yield improvements in the PGD2-HR1 (2.3 fold curcumin) and the PGD3-HR3 clone (0.9 and 1.65 folds of curcumin-monoglucoside and curcumin respectively). These findings proved the advantageous use of HR cultures as the production source for curcumin and its glucoside, which remained unexplored so far."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
