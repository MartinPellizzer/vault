A lack of overview complicates monitoring and regulating the use of MPs during pregnancy.", "This systematic review analyses prevalence of use of MPs during pregnancy, regional distribution, types and prevalence, MP properties, potential health risks, and consensus of MPs use, and suggests relevant measures to mitigate negative effects on pregnancy.", "A search was undertaken using a range of scientific databases (Medline, Embase, African Journals OnLine, Google Scholar and Biological Abstracts), non-governmental organisations, various African universities and regulatory websites for original published and unpublished studies that assess and indicate the prevalence of use of MPs during pregnancy in Africa. Additional articles were located by exploring pertinent bibliographies, and contacting experts.", "A total of 3659 MP-use studies were found, but only 303 articles received full-text assessment for eligibility and finally only 50 scientific papers were eligible for the systematic review. The prevalence of MP use by pregnant women varied widely from 2% to 100%. Twenty-eight studies (56%) specified one or more plant species used as MP during pregnancy. The major reasons for MP use were relief of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), stimulation of labour, and facilitation of childbirth. The most commonly cited MP species were Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Allium sativum L. and Cucurbita pepo L. and these were used for relief of NVP, motion sickness and as a nutritional supplement. Route of administration was most commonly oral, and few adverse effects were reported.", "The use of MPs among pregnant women in Africa is prevalent, and the most commonly used plant species are not known to have harmful foetal effects during pregnancy. However, many of the MP species are poorly studied and teratogenic effects cannot be ruled out. Collaboration between healthcare providers and traditional practitioners to inform about the safe use of MPs may promote safer pregnancies and better health for mothers and infants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
