TTC(2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) solution was used to test the pollen vigor.", "The stigma life-span of P. grandiflorum was about 9 days, however the optimal time for pollination is 4-6 days after the petals opening, with the stigma was splitting lightly or significantly. When the petals opened, the anther began scattering pollen, and finished in the same day. The pollen vigor was about 81.4% at the beginning, and decreases to 27.6% three days later. The pollen vigor still remains 64.4% three days later, when the flower was kept in the desiccant. The natural fructification rate of self-flower-pollination was 4.8%. The fructification rate and compatible index was about 62.7% and 54.6, respectively, when the self-plant-pollination performed by hand. They decreased to 12.8% and 6.5 when the pollination was implemented during the flowering period.", "Low fructification percentage of self-flower-pollination attributes to the difference of maturing period of pistil and stamen, as well as the short pollen life-span of P. grandiflorum. The compatibility of self-plant-pollination is high during flowering period when pollination performed by hand. The life-span of the pollen can be prolonged significantly when keeping in the dry environment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Chinese Peking Union Medical College, Beijing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Jian-he", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu-qi", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shi-lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hui-zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Cheng-min", "Initials": "CM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Qing-long", "Initials": "QL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Platycodon"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16711415"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
