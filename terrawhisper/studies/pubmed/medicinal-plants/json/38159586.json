Thymus daenensis (T) and Mentha piperita (M) EOs were employed to make nanoemulsions (TEO and MEO NE), using Tween 80/Span 80 as surfactant/cosurfactant and a high-speed homogenizer. The TEO and MEO NEs were then characterized in terms of particle size (121, 113\u00a0nm), surface charge (-11.2 and -12.6\u00a0mV), morphology, and stability over time. Then, the antibacterial activity of EOs and their nanoformulations against Escherichia coli (E. coli) were evaluated based on various residence times, and concentrations on a microfluidic chip. The release of cytoplasmic constituents was used to compare the antibacterial activity of bulk EOs and nanoformulations. After completing MIC, MBC, and time-killing assays, the inhibitory effect of nanoformulations on E. coli biofilm formation was examined. Remarkable intensification was observed by employing a microfluidic chip owing to high-contact surface area provision between nanoemulsions and bacteria. Once compared to the conventional method for 3\u00a0h operation, the bacterial activity was nearly completely inhibited in a 24-min residence time using nanoemulsions. After 6\u00a0min of treatment, the cell membrane began to rupture, indicating that nanoemulsions could improve the antibacterial activity of bulk essential oils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
