Only a fraction of the earth's natural pharmacopoeia has been analyzed with modern techniques. The threat of imminent extinction of many plant species, especially in tropical areas, makes it urgent that scientists learn as much as possible before old remedies are forgotten or their raw materials are destroyed. This process requires the observation and recording of medical techniques, identification of plant materials, and experimental investigation of the ingredients and their effects. The success of ethnopharmacology often depends on earning the trust of local experts. To aid research in this area, Dr. Norman Farnsworth of the University of Illinois has computerized information on the biologic activities of 1000s of plants and other natural products, including over 3000 plant species used to regulate human fertility. Ethnopharmacology can also be an important element of a developing nation's medical and economic system. Third World governments are being encouraged to seek a synthesis between modern and traditional medicine. Although developing countries are providing many of the raw materials needed in drug manufacturing, the final products are often returned as high-priced medicines. As more plants are needed for large-scale production, overharvesting has led to stock depletion. Chemists have so far been unable to reproduce the complex structure of many plant compounds. Further coordinated research into folk traditions, plant species, growing conditions, and local medical needs is urged. Care must be taken, however, to preserve the main advantages of traditional medical care: low cost and easy access."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["029935", "00142146"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: IDRC REPORTS"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Delivery Of Health Care", "Drugs", "Health", "Health Services", "Indigenous Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal--therapeutic use", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12313474", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "08", "Day": "07"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0315-9981", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "14", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "The IDRC reports", "ISOAbbreviation": "IDRC Rep"}, "ArticleTitle": "The green pharmacy.
