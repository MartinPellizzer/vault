Sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and the 5.8S coding region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat were obtained for the 12 species of Panax to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Of the 2 eastern North American species, P. quinquefolius and P. trifolius, P. quinquefolius was suggested to be more closely related to the eastern Asian species in the ITS tree, while P. trifolius was phylogenetically isolated. Monophyly of the three medicinally most important species, P. ginseng, P. notoginseng, and P. quinquefolius, suggested by previous workers, was not supported by the ITS data. A close phylogenetic relationship between Panax and Aralia was supported. Several biogeographical implications were inferred: (1) two divergence events have produced the eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct distribution in Panax, (2) no intercontinental species pairs are found in Panax; (3) a discrepancy between the sequence divergence pattern and the phylogenetic pattern was observed in Panax, suggesting the need for caution in using sequence divergence data alone in inferring biogeographical patterns; (4) the Himalayas and central and western China are the current centers of diversity of the ginseng genus; and (5) the low ITS sequence divergence and a close relationship among species in that region suggest that rapid evolutionary radiation may have created such a diversity of Panax in the Himalayas and in central and western China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Systematics, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC 20560, USA."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zimmer", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["U41672", "U41673", "U41674", "U41675", "U41676", "U41677", "U41678", "U41679", "U41680", "U41681", "U41682", "U41683", "U41684", "U41685", "U41686", "U41687", "U41688", "U41689", "U41690", "U41691", "U41692", "U41693", "U41694", "U41695", "U41696", "U41697", "U41698", "U41699", "U41700", "U41701"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Phylogenet Evol", "NlmUniqueID": "9304400", "ISSNLinking": "1055-7903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8899721", "10.1006/mpev.1996.0069", "S1055-7903(96)90069-X"]}}]}
