DOP1 and DOP2 obtained carbohydrate (65.71% and 70.18%, respectively), uronic acid (63.71% and 24.84%, respectively) and protein (8.09% and 9.51%, respectively) with molecular weight of 49.24\u00a0kDa and 21.62\u00a0kDa, respectively. DOP samples were mainly composed of mannose, glucose, galacturonic acid, galactose, and glucuronic acid. The digestibility in vitro, antioxidant activity and intestinal peristalsis effect were then investigated. DOP1 and DOP2 were degraded with decreased molecular weights (39.58\u00a0kDa and 18.56\u00a0kDa respectively), increased reducing sugar contents (from 16.95% to 19.27%; 12.45% to 15.50% respectively) and free monosaccharides (from 0.89% to 1.42%; 0.90% to 1.14% respectively) after gastric digestion. Both DOP1 and DOP2 were resistant to intestinal digestion, suggesting that DOP samples can be considered as a dietary fiber. Additionally, DOP1 and DOP2 exhibited antioxidant activities positively correlated with the concentration and remained the activities after gastrointestinal digestion in vitro. Furthermore, DOP reduced the fluorescence intensity significantly, indicating DOP can promote the intestinal peristalsis of zebrafish larvae (5 pdf) at 500\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Therefore, DOP1 and DOP2 have a better functionality as dietary fibers, including antioxidant activity and intestinal peristalsis promotion, which can be developed as functional foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
