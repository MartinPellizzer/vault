TNF-aconcentration in cultured cardiomyocytes with H/R, was determined by ELISA method, the protein expression of Fas/FasL genes were estimated by immunohisto-chemistry.", "After cardiomyocytes were made with H/R, Compared with control group, the positive expression index (PEI) of Fas/FasL proteins in cardiomyocytes increased significantly, Compared with H/R groups, the PEI of Fas/FasL proteins were lower significantly in groups with different dosages of TFG (P < 0.05). TFG inhibited the secretion of TNF-alpha from myocardial cells and increased the survival rate of myocardial cells.", "The protein expression of apoptosis-associated Fas/FasL genes increased during H/R. The TFG can protect myocardium against H/R injury by decreasing the production of TNF-alpha, downregulating the protein expression of Fas/FasL genes, and then inhibiting myocyte apoptosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou 310014, China. lala-1856@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Bao-Xing", "Initials": "BX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Bin-Xiang", "Initials": "BX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fas Ligand Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fas Ligand Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gynostemma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18051909"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
