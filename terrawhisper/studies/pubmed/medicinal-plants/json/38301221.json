It is grown in most parts of China and has high economic value as a traditional Chinese medicine. In September of 2022, <i>E. ciliata</i> plants located at the planting base of traditional Chinses medicine in Daying county (30\u00b035'40\u2033N, 105\u00b014 12\u2033E), Sichuan Province, China, were recorded with leaf blight. The incidence of symptomatic plants was 15% (30 infected plants out of 200 surveyed). The symptoms included an irregular necrotic lesion at the tip of the leaf, which gradually expanded across the entire leaf. To elucidate the cause of the symptoms, 12 symptomatic leaves were sampled from four different plants and 5\u00d75 mm section, including symptomatic and non-symptomatic tissue was excised. Tissue samples were disinfected in 75% ethanol for 30s, and 7% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, and then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water (Sun et al. 2022). The sampled tissues were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25\u2103 in the dark. Seven days later, single spores were recovered onto fresh PDA (Zhu et al. 1992). Colonies on PDA initially appeared white, developing grayish-green conidia with white margins. Conidia (n=150) were collected and observed under the microscope. The conidia were smooth walled and dark brown, with pear-shaped, 12.1-31.4 \u00d7 5.0-9.4\u03bcm, with 3-5 transverse septa, 1-3 longitudinal or oblique septa. Conidiophores were thick, dark brown, simple with multiple conidial scars, 5.0-75.5 \u00d7 2.5.0-5.0\u03bcm. Based on morphological observations the 12 isolates were most similar to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> (Simmons 2007). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA regions, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>gpd</i>), <i>Alternaria</i> major allergen (<i>Alt a 1</i>), RNA polymerase second largest subunit gene (<i>RPB2</i>) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (<i>TEF 1</i>) were amplified and sequenced using the primers ITS4/ITS5, RPB2-5F/RPB2-7CR, gpd1/gpd2, EF1-728F/EF1-986R, and Alt-for/Alt-rev respectively (Woudenberg et al. 2015). The sequences of representative isolate (XR) were uploaded in GenBank (ITS: OM319521, <i>RPB2</i>: OM849248, <i>gpd</i>: OM296240, <i>TEF1</i>: OM238122, and <i>Alt a 1</i>: OM649814). The bootstrap value of the isolate and the type strain CBS 595.93 (ITS: KP124320, <i>RPB2</i>: KP124788, <i>gpd</i>: KP124175, <i>TEF1</i>: KP125096, and <i>Alt a 1</i>: JQ646399) on the phylogenetic tree was 99%. Therefore, based on morphology and phylogenetic analysis the fungus was identified as <i>A. alternata</i>. To verify pathogenicity, a spore suspension (1 \u00d7 106 conidia/ml) of the representative isolate XR was misted onto the foliage of six twenty-day-old non-symptomatic plants. Six additional plants were sprayed with distilled water and used as controls. The plants were covered with plastic bags for 48 h and incubated at a temperature of 28\u2103 in the dark. Eight days later, all inoculated plants demonstrated similar symptoms as recorded on the original source, while the control plants were symptomless. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. <i>A. alternata</i> was re-isolated from the artificially inoculated plants, hence fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our best knowledge this is the first report of leaf blight caused by <i>A. alternata</i> in China on E. ciliate. The disease may be an economic threat and should be further monitored and studied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University Of Chinese Medicine, college of pharmacy, 24 Heping Road, Xiangfang District, Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, China, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, 150040; 359896987@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Haifeng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, college of Pharmacy, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China; 53884824@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zilong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, college of Pharmacy, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China; 849730336@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Xue", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Harbin, China; 1146935857@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "16", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38301221", "10.1094/PDIS-09-23-1814-PDN"]}}]}
