In this regard, the restoration of nonspecific protective factors that normally prevent the adhesion and colonization of pathogens is of interest for clinicians. To date, scientific data has been accumulated about the anti-uropathogenic and antiadhesive activity of many plant extracts. However, studies on the specific action of herbal components are limited. Data on the chemical composition, mechanisms of action, in vivo and in vitro efficacy of medicinal plants growing on the European continent and used for the prevention or treatment of acute and chronic (recurrent) urinary tract infections are presented in the review."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FGBOU VO Omsk State Medical University of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Department of Surgical diseases and Urology with the Course of Additional Professional Education, Omsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Tsukanov", "ForeName": "A Yu", "Initials": "AY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FGBOU VO Omsk State Medical University of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Department of Surgical diseases and Urology with the Course of Additional Professional Education, Omsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Matveev", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "FGBOU VO Omsk State Medical University of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Department of Surgical diseases and Urology with the Course of Additional Professional Education, Omsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nurgalieva", "ForeName": "A I", "Initials": "AI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Urologiia", "NlmUniqueID": "100900900", "ISSNLinking": "1728-2985"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Tract Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34967180"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
