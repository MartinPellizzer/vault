Chromatofocussing yielded a single form of the enzyme of apparent pI 5.0. This preparation was used to raise rabbit anti-(chalcone isomerase) serum. Changes in the rate of synthesis of chalcone isomerase have been investigated by indirect immunoprecipitation of enzyme labelled in vivo with [35S]methionine in elicitor-treated cultures of P. vulgaris. Elicitor, heat-released from cell walls of the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of anthracnose disease of bean, causes increased synthesis of the isomerase, with maximum synthetic rate occurring 11-12 h after exposure to elicitor. Immune blotting studies indicate that the elicitor-mediated increase in extractable activity of the isomerase is associated with increased appearance of immunodetactable isomerase protein of Mr 27 000. However, the maximum level of immunodetectable isomerase was attained approximately 6 h earlier than maximum extractable activity. Furthermore, a 2.8-fold increase in enzyme activity above basal levels at 12 h after elicitor-treatment was associated with a corresponding 5.8-fold increase in immunodetectable enzyme. It is concluded that elicitor induces the synthesis of both active and inactive chalcone isomerase of Mr 27 000, and that some activation of inactive enzyme occurs during the elicitor-mediated increase in isomerase activity. The presence of a pool of inactive chalcone isomerase in bean cell cultures has recently been suggested on the basis of density labelling experiments utilising 2H from 2H2O [Dixon et al. (1983) Planta (Berl.) 159, 561-569]."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Robbins", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dixon", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "chalcone isomerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photofluorography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6489352", "10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08540.x"]}}]}
