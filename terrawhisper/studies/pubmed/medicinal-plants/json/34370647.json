Also, in the last decades, the use of different nutritional supplements has been implemented to treat all kinds of diseases, including those that present an alteration in cognitive functioning. Dementia is a clinical syndrome in which a person's mental and cognitive capacities gradually decline. As the disease progresses, the person's autonomy diminishes. As there is not an effective treatment to prevent progressive deterioration in many of these pathologies, nutritional interventions have been, and still are, one of the most widely explored therapeutic possibilities. In this review, we have discussed a great number of potentially interesting plants, nutritional derivatives, and probiotics for the treatment of dementia around the world. Their action mechanisms generally involve neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, b-amyloid, and tau anti-aggregate actions; brain blood flow improvement, and effects on synaptic cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, which may optimize cognitive performance in patients with cognitive impairment. As for their efficacy in patients with cognitive impairment and/or dementias, evidence is still scarce andthe outcomes are controversial. We consider that many of these substances have promising therapeutic properties. Therefore, the scientific community has to continue with a complete research focused on both identifying possible action mechanisms and carrying out clinical trials, preferably randomized, double-blind ones, with a greater number of patients, a long-term follow-up, dose standardization, and the use of current diagnostic criteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Urquiza 609,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Dorman", "ForeName": "Guido", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Institute, Favaloro Foundation Hospital, Buenos Aires,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Flores", "ForeName": "Ignacio", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Neurology, Tornu Hospital, Buenos Aires,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "ForeName": "Carlos", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Urquiza 609,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Casta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "Ramiro Fern\u00e1ndez", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Urquiza 609,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Aldecoa", "ForeName": "Mayra", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Ramos Mejia, Urquiza 609,Argentina."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Leandro", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269155", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cognition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dementia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34370647", "10.2174/1871527320666210809121230", "CNSNDDT-EPUB-117189"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
