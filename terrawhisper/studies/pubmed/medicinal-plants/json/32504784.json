A. Mey. is a traditional tonic that has been used for thousands of years, and has positive effects on vascular diseases. Ginsenoside Rg1 (GS-Rg1) is one of the active ingredients of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey. and has been shown to have beneficial effects against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our previously study has found that GS-Rg1 can mobilize bone marrow stem cells and inhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation and phenotype transformation. However, pharmacological effects and mechanism of GS-Rg1 in inhibiting intimal hyperplasia is still unknown.", "This study was aimed to investigate whether GS-Rg1 prevented vascular intimal hyperplasia, and the involvement of stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1)/CXCR4, stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit and fractalkine (FKN)/CX3CR1 axes.", "Rats were operated with carotid artery balloon injury. The treatment groups were injected with 4, 8 and 16\u00a0mg/kg of GS-Rg1 for 14 days. The degree of intimal hyperplasia was evaluated by histopathological examination. The expression of \u03b1-SMA (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin) and CD133 were detected by double-label immunofluorescence. Serum levels of SDF-1\u03b1, SCF and soluble FKN (sFKN) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expressions of SCF, SDF-1\u03b1 and FKN, as well as the receptors c-kit, CXC chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and CX3C chemokine receptor type 1 (CX3CR1) were detected by immunochemistry.", "GS-Rg1 reduced intimal hyperplasia by evidence of the values of NIA, the ratio of NIA/MA, and the ratio of NIA/IELA and the ratio of NIA/LA, especially in 16\u00a0mg/kg group. Furthermore, GS-Rg1 8\u00a0mg/kg group and 16\u00a0mg/kg group decreased the protein expressions of the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4, SCF/c-kit and FKN/CX3CR1 axes in neointima, meanwhile GS-Rg1 8\u00a0mg/kg group and 16\u00a0mg/kg group also attenuated the expressions of SDF-1\u03b1, SCF and sFKN in serum. In addition, the expression of \u03b1-SMA and CD133 marked smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs) was decreased after GS-Rg1 treatment.", "GS-Rg1 has a positive effect on inhibiting vascular intimal hyperplasia, and the underlying mechanism is related to inhibitory expression of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4, SCF/c-kit and FKN/CX3CR1 axes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
