Farmers commonly use chemical fertilizers to attain maximal biomass and yield, which have negative effects on the growth, development, and bioactive constituents of such medicinally important plants. Because of its low cost, environmentally friendly behavior, and nondestructive impact on soil fertility, plant health, and human health, the use of beneficial rhizobial microbiota is an alternative strategy for increasing the production of useful medicinal plants under both standard and stressed conditions. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) associated with medicinal plants belong to the genera Azotobacter, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Burkholderia, Exiguobacterium, Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Mycobacterium, Methylobacterium, and Serratia. These microbes enhance plant growth parameters by producing secondary metabolites, including enzymes and antibiotics, which help in nutrient uptake, enhance soil fertility, improve plant growth, and protect against plant pathogens. The role of\u00a0PGPR\u00a0in the production of biomass and their effect on the quality of bioactive compounds (phytochemicals) is described in this review. Additionally, the mitigation of environmental stresses including drought stress, saline stress, alkaline stress, and flooding stress to herbal plants is illustrated."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Saurashtra University, Rajkot, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Vaghela", "ForeName": "Nishtha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3411-6381"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Saurashtra University, Rajkot, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Gohel", "ForeName": "Sangeeta", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ECR/2016/000928 Dated: 20.03.2017", "Agency": "DST-SERB (Department of Science and Technology-Science and Engineering Research Board), New Delhi, India", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8503885", "ISSNLinking": "0233-111X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chowti PS, Rudrapur S, Naik BK.
