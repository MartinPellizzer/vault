The experiments were performed in parallel in non-infected and in L. major-infected RAW 264.7 cells and the expression profiles were compared with those mediated by IFN-gamma plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The infection per se induced the expression first of IL-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA, later that of IL-10 mRNA. Gallic acid induced low and transient levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in non-infected cells, and it clearly enhanced and prolonged iNOS and cytokine mRNA expressions in Leishmania-parasitised cells. Interestingly, and in contrast to activation by IFN-gamma/LPS, gallic acid also stimulated Leishmania-infected cells to produce IFN-gamma mRNA. For IFN-alpha, a sandwich immunoassay was performed to determine its amount present in the supernatant of gallic acid-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In showing predominant stimulation of infected cells and the induction especially of IFN-gamma, a cytokine that plays a central role in antimicrobial macrophage and T cell regulation, these data provide the basis for an immunological concept of gallic acid and possibly other plant polyphenols for their beneficial effects in various infectious conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radtke", "ForeName": "Oliver A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiderlen", "ForeName": "Albrecht F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kayser", "ForeName": "Oliver", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kolodziej", "ForeName": "Herbert", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, mouse"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoassay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leishmania major"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15490320", "10.1055/s-2004-832618"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
