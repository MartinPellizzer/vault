In this study, extracts (water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, and n-hexane) of two halophytes of the genus <i>Petrosimonia</i> (<i>P. brachiata</i> and <i>P. nigdeensis</i>) were investigated for their phytochemical profiles and pharmacological properties. The phytochemical profiles of both species were investigated using an untargeted metabolomics approach based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. The two species show different polyphenolic profiles and these are influenced by the different extraction solvents used. The same extracts were used for different bioactivity assays. The results show that all extracts yielded total flavonoid and phenolic contents of 11.14-24.22 mg GAE/g and 3.15-22.03 mg RE/g, respectively. While extracts of both species demonstrated a radical scavenging ability in the ABTS assay (16.12-98.02 mg TE/g), only the polar and moderately polar extracts (water, ethanol, and ethyl acetate) showed scavenging potential in the DPPH assay (4.74-16.55 mg TE/g). A reducing potential was also displayed by all extracts in the CUPRAC and FRAP assays (26.02-80.35 mg TE/g and 31.70-67.69 mg TE/g, respectively). The total antioxidant capacity of the extracts ranged from 0.24 to 2.17 mmol TE/g, and the metal chelating activity ranged from 14.74 to 33.80 mg EDTAE/g. The water extracts possessed a higher metal chelating power than the other extracts. All extracts acted as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (0.16-3.85 mg GALAE/g) and amylase (0.11-1.28 mmol ACAE/g). Moreover, apart from the water extracts, the other extracts also showed anti-butyrylcholinesterase activity (0.73-2.86 mg GALAE/g), as well as anti-tyrosinase (36.74-61.40 mg KAE/g) and anti-glucosidase (2.37-2.73 mmol ACAE/g) potential. In general, the water extracts were found to be weak inhibitors of the tested enzymes, while the ethanol extracts mostly showed an inhibitory effect. The obtained findings revealed the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory properties of these two species and demonstrated that the solvent type used affected the pharmacological properties of the extracts and hence, can be useful to further investigate the active constituents yielded in the extracts and understand the mechanisms involved."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2086-9048"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Food Process, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 29122 Piacenza, Italy."}], "LastName": "De Gregorio", "ForeName": "Marco A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9278-0459"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Food Process, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 29122 Piacenza, Italy."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Leilei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Research and Development, Duy Tan University, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Engineering & Technology, Duy Tan University, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Mahomoodally", "ForeName": "Mohamad Fawzi", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya 42130, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Mauritius, R\u00e9duit 80837, Mauritius."}], "LastName": "Jugreet", "ForeName": "Sharmeen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4675-2027"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Science Faculty, Selcuk University, Konya 42130, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yildiztugay", "ForeName": "Evren", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5601-2954"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Crop Production, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 84, 29122 Piacenza, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fiorini", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5133-9464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sustainable Food Process, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, 29122 Piacenza, Italy."}], "LastName": "Lucini", "ForeName": "Luigi", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Plants (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101596181", "ISSNLinking": "2223-7747"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124192", "10.3390/plants13152073", "plants13152073"]}}]}
