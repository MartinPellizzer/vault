The current study investigated changes in heavy-metal [cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr) nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)] concentrations in soils located near highly trafficked roads in Korea and the subsequent uptake of these metals by Chinese cabbage. Heavy-metal plant concentrations were determined in both washed and unwashed plant leaves to determine whether foliar deposition played any role in plant metal uptake. Soil concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were all lower than the Korean standard soil limits and showed no significant influence from road traffic. In contrast, both Ni and Cr concentrations in soils collected within 10\u00a0m of the road were 4 and 5 times greater, respectively, than those in soils collected 70\u00a0m from the road. Heavy-metal concentrations in unwashed Chinese cabbage leaf collected at 5\u00a0m from the road were consistently greater than those of washed leaf samples, thus indicating the deposition of traffic-related particles on the plant surface. With the exception of Cu, all heavy-metal concentration in washed plant samples collected at 5\u00a0m also showed greater accumulation compared with samples collected further away. This was mainly attributed to increased total soil heavy-metal concentrations and increased metal phytoavailability induced by decreases in soil pH near the road. However, overall heavy-metal soil concentrations were well lower than the allowable concentrations, and the levels observed in plants collected in this study were considered not to currently pose a significant risk to human health. However, some traffic-related heavy metals, in particular Cr and Ni, were being accumulated in the roadside UA environment, which may warrant some caution regarding the environment and/or health issues in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemical Safety, Department of Agro-Food Safety, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Wanju, 55365, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyuck Soo", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Medicinal Plant Resources, Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology, Jinju, 52725, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kwon-Rae", "Initials": "KR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Chemical Safety, Department of Agro-Food Safety, National Institute of Agricultural Sciences, Wanju, 55365, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Won-Il", "Initials": "WI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Contaminants Group, Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, 5095, Australia."}], "LastName": "Owens", "ForeName": "Gary", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of Seoul, Seoul, 02504, Korea. johnkim@uos.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kye-Hoon", "Initials": "KH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0357245", "ISSNLinking": "0090-4341"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Particulate Matter"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vehicle Emissions"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Particulate Matter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vehicle Emissions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27999877", "10.1007/s00244-016-0344-y", "10.1007/s00244-016-0344-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
