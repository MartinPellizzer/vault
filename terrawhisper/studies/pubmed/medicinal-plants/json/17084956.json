Quercetin, one of the potent antioxidant bioflavonoid compounds, has been shown to alleviate oxidative injury by modulation of gene expression leading to suppression of production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and conferring an antiapoptotic activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of quercetin in a model of phenylhydrazine (PHZ)-induced oxidant stress, vascular dysfunction and hemodynamic disturbance in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered quercetin orally (25 or 50mg/kg/day) for 6 days. On day four, all animals except those in the normal control group, were administered PHZ intraperitoneally. The results showed that PHZ induced severe hemolysis. The mean arterial pressure and hindlimb vascular resistance of PHZ-control rats were markedly decreased compared to normal controls. Treatment with quercetin significantly improved arterial blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance. Vascular responsiveness to bradykinin, acetylcholine, and phenylephrine in PHZ-control rats was dramatically suppressed and quercetin restored these responses in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin partially protected blood glutathione, suppressed plasma malondialdehyde levels, and largely suppressed nitric oxide metabolites and superoxide anion production. These results provide the first evidence for the role of the flavonoid, quercetin, in the alleviation of vascular dysfunction in an animal model of PHZ-induced oxidant stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luangaram", "ForeName": "Saowanee", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukongviriyapan", "ForeName": "Upa", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pakdeechote", "ForeName": "Poungrat", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukongviriyapan", "ForeName": "Veerapol", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pannangpetch", "ForeName": "Patchareewan", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "064F424C9K", "NameOfSubstance": "phenylhydrazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia, Hemolytic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Resistance"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17084956", "10.1016/j.fct.2006.09.008", "S0278-6915(06)00271-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
