Autoradiograms of corn and soybean seedlings grown in hydroponic solutions showed no translocation of 14C-PBB from 14C-PBB-treated solutions to plant tops or within the leaf from 14C-PBB-treated spots on the upper leaf surface. A significant portion of the 14C-PBB associated with the roots was removed when the roots were dipped in acetone. Three root crops (radishes, carrots, and onions) were grown in two soils, each treated with a mixture of FireMaster BP-6 (PBB) and 14C-PBB to achieve final concentrations of 100 ppm and 100 ppb. All roots showed more PBB when grown in the soil with the lower clay and organic matter content than they did when grown in the soil with more clay and organic matter. In the latter soil (clay loam) no PBB was detected in any roots from the 100 ppb treatment. More PBB was associated with roots of carrot than of radish or onion. Corn leaf whorls containing dust from a PBB contamination soil and washed radishes from a heavily contaminated garden showed no PBB."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jacobs", "ForeName": "L W", "Initials": "LW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Penner", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tiedje", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Health Perspect", "NlmUniqueID": "0330411", "ISSNLinking": "0091-6765"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polybrominated Biphenyls"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Michigan"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polybrominated Biphenyls"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Health Perspect. 1978 Apr;23:1-8", "ArticleIdList": ["209960"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1976 Nov-Dec;24(6):1201-4", "ArticleIdList": ["187635"]}, {"Citation": "J Agric Food Chem. 1976 Nov-Dec;24(6):1198-201", "ArticleIdList": ["187634"]}, {"Citation": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol. 1974 Jun;11(6):523-8", "ArticleIdList": ["4215507"]}, {"Citation": "J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1975 Nov;58(6):1202-5", "ArticleIdList": ["1194183"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["210006", "PMC1637461", "10.1289/ehp.78239"]}}]}
