(bilberry) fruits and fruit extracts are widely available in the market. Although bilberry leaves and stems are considered as bio-waste, they contain much higher levels of phenolic compounds than fruits. The study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial and anticancer potential of aerial part extracts from <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> L. (<i>V. myrtillus</i>, VM) plants harvested at high altitudes in Armenian landscape and characterize the bioactive phytochemicals.", "For evaluation of antioxidant properties, chemical-based tests (total phenolic and flavonoid content, and antiradical activity in 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) tests) and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) assay were applied. Genotoxicity and anticancer properties of the extract alone and in combination with fluorouracil were explored in human cancer and normal cell lines. Antibacterial properties of <i>V.</i> <i>myrtillus</i> extract alone and in combination with antibiotics, as well as their effect on proton-flux rate through cell membrane were explored on bacterial strains. The characterization of active phytochemicals was done using Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS).", "The <i>V. myrtillus</i> aerial part extract demonstrated promising antioxidant properties in all tests. The selective cytotoxic activity was documented against various cancer cell lines (human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa)), while it did not inhibit the growth of tested human normal primary renal mixed epithelial cells (HREC) even at 10-fold higher concentrations. The extract did not have genotoxic properties in comet assay making it a potential source for the development of anticancer preparations. The investigated extract did not directly inhibit the growth of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> (<i>S. typhimurium</i>) strains at up to 1 mg/mL concentration. However, <i>V. myrtillus</i> extract enhanced the kanamycin intake and increased its efficiency against <i>E. coli</i> strain. The phytochemical characterization of the extract showed the presence of different groups of phenolics.", "Based on obtained data, we suggest the aerial parts of the <i>V. myrtillus</i> plant as an alternative source of bioactive natural products for food supplements, nutraceuticals, functional foods and medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
