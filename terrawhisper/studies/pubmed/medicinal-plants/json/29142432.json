Furthermore, we tested the extract for <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity and inhibition of elastase and collagenase.", "The aqueous methanol extract was analyzed by UHPLC-MS for the content of polyphenols and terpenoids. The prevention of glycated albumin-induced cell damage was tested in four mammalian cell lines (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human embryonic kidney cells - HEK293, normal human fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary cells) with the 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4,5-dimethylthiazoly)-3-(4-sulfophenyl) tetrazolium assay.", "Glycated albumin is significantly more toxic than native human serum albumin (LC<sub>50</sub> from 35.00 to 48.34 \u03bcg/mL vs. 5.47-9.10 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). The extract, rich in rosmarinic acid (344.27 mg/g dry mass), mitigated the glycated albumin toxicity, and increased glycated albumin-treated cell survival by more than 50%. The inhibition of advanced glycation endproduct formation was confirmed by monitoring conformational changes. The free radical scavenging activity was higher than Trolox and metal reducing power was one-third to half that of ascorbic acid. The activity of elastase and collagenase was inhibited by 54.75% \u00b1 6.87% and 60.03% \u00b1 7.22%, respectively.", "The results confirm antiglycative and antiglycotoxic potential of <i>Perovskia</i> root and its traditional antidiabetic use. The high activity can be attributed to rosmarinic acid abundance.", "Perovskia is a small genus of aromatic shrubby plants growing in arid regions of Central and South Asia. Different parts are used in folk medicine as antiparasitic, anti-infectious and antidiabetic remedy. Here, we have studied the extract from roots for inhibition of: glycation-induced cytotoxicity, human serum albumin glycation, inflammation-related enzymes, as well as for antioxidant activity. Result: the extract from P. atriplicifolia roots inhibited protein glycation and AGE-induced toxicity in cell cultures. The mechanism is likely to rely on the antioxidant activity of high content of rosmarinic acid. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> AGE: advanced glycation end-products; DPPH: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl; HSA: human serum albumin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Division of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Miroliaei", "ForeName": "Mehran", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Division of Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aminjafari", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Biochemistry, Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation (IUNG), Pulawy, Poland."}], "LastName": "\u015alusarczyk", "ForeName": "Sylwester", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Nawrot-Hadzik", "ForeName": "Izabela", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, College of Agriculture, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimmalek", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology and Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Matkowski", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Petersen M, Simmonds MS.
