Infectious diseases caused by these multidrug-resistant bacteria are major causes of morbidity and mortality in human beings. Synthetic drugs are expensive and inadequate for the treatment of diseases, causing side effects and ineffective against multidrug-resistant bacteria. The medicinal plants are promising to have effective antimicrobial property due to presence of phytochemical compounds like alkaloids, flavanoids, tannins and phenolic compounds. The present study aimed to find the antimicrobial activity of medicinal plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were identified by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Production of \u03b2-lactamases (extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamases, metallo \u03b2-lactamase and AmpC \u03b2-lactamase) were identified by combination disc method. Antibacterial activity of aqueous and ethanol extract of Aristolochia indica and Toddalia asiatica were detected by agar well diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration. All bacteria used in this study showed antibiotic resistance to \u22653 antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae were found to be positive for \u03b2-lactamase production. Ethanol extract of Aristolochia indica showed more significant antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria than Toddalia asiatica. Ethanol extracts of Aristolochia indica and Toddalia asiatica showed minimum inhibitory concentration values of 50-100 \u03bcg/ml and 100-200 \u03bcg/ml, respectively against multidrug-resistant bacteria. From this study, it was concluded that Aristolochia indica has more potential to treat multidrug-resistant bacteria than Toddalia asiatica."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Loyola College (Autonomous), Chennai-600 034, India."}], "LastName": "Venkatadri", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Presidency College (Autonomous), Chennai-600 005, India."}], "LastName": "Arunagirinathan", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Biotechnology, Presidency College (Autonomous), Chennai-600 005, India."}], "LastName": "Rameshkumar", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Loyola College (Autonomous), Chennai-600 034, India."}], "LastName": "Ramesh", "ForeName": "Latha", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Dr. ALM Post Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Sciences University of Madras Taramani Campus, Chennai-600 113, India."}], "LastName": "Dhanasezhian", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Loyola College (Autonomous), Chennai-600 034, India."}], "LastName": "Agastian", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7809431", "ISSNLinking": "0250-474X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Geneva, Switzerland: WHO; 2004.
