Retrorsine (RTS) is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid (distributed in many medicinal plants) that has significant hepatotoxicity. Here, we aimed to determine the daily variations in RTS hepatotoxicity (chronotoxicity) in mice, and to investigate the role of metabolism in generating RTS chronotoxicity.2. Acute toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies were performed with mice after RTS administration at different times of the day. Hepatotoxicity was assessed by measuring plasma ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) levels. mRNA and proteins were determined by qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. Time-dependent <i>in vitro</i> metabolism of RTS was assessed by using mouse liver microsomes.3. We found that RTS toxicity was more severe in the dark phase (zeitgeber time 14 or ZT14 and ZT18) than in the light phase (ZT2 and ZT6). This chronotoxicity was associated with a dosing time difference in the systemic exposures of RTS and a pyrrolic ester metabolite (a cause of hepatotoxicity, measured by the levels of pyrrole-GSH conjugate and pyrrole-protein adducts due to a high chemical reactivity). Moreover, the CYP3A11 (a major enzyme for RTS bioactivation) inhibitor ketoconazole decreased the production of pyrrole-GSH conjugate and abrogated diurnal rhythm in RTS metabolism. In addition, <i>E4bp4</i> (a circadian regulator of <i>Cyp3a11</i>) ablation abolished the rhythm of CYP3A11 expression and abrogated the dosing time-dependency of RTS toxicity.4. In conclusion, RTS chronotoxicity in mice was attributed to time-varying hepatic metabolism regulated by the circadian clock. Our findings have implications for reducing pyrrolizidine alkaloid-induced toxicity via a chronotherapeutic approach."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, Zhongshan Torch Development Zone Hospital, Zhongshan, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Haiman", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Intensive Care Unit, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, College of Pharmacy, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Danyi", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinan University, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Rhythm and Metabolism, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Baojian", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Xenobiotica", "NlmUniqueID": "1306665", "ISSNLinking": "0049-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyp3a11 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XJ86XWL8IY", "NameOfSubstance": "retrorsine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Clocks"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34311664", "10.1080/00498254.2021.1950867"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
