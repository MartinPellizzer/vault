In addition, bulbs of lily have been extensively used as edible and medicinal herbs in northern and eastern Asia, especially in China (Yu et al. 2015; China Pharmacopoeia Committee 2020; Tang et al. 2021). In August of 2021, a disease of stem and leaf rot was observed on lily cultivar 'White planet' with approximately 25% disease incidence in the greenhouse and fields at the Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Beijing, China). The bulbs of symptomatic plants were brown and rotten, with sunken lesions. Symptomatic plants showed short, discolored leaves, and eventually lead to stem wilt and death of the whole plants. Infected bulbs were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 s, then in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. A 0.5\u00d70.5 cm2 tissue piece was then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and incubated at 25\u00b11\u2103. After 5 days, the isolate was purified by single spore isolation technique. The singled-spored fungal colony was characterized by fluffy white aerial mycelia, and produced orange pigments with age. After seven days on Spezieller Nahrstoffarmer agar (SNA), conidia produced from simple lateral phialides. Macroconidia have pronounced dorsiventral curvature typical, significantly enlarged in the middle, a tapered whip-liked pointed apical cell and characteristic foot-shaped basal cell, 3 to 6 septate, measuring 18.71 to 43.01\u00d72.89 to 5.56 \u03bcm with an average size of 26.98\u00d73.90 \u03bcm (n=30). Microconidia were not observed. Typical verrucose thick chlamydospore with rough walls were profuse in chains or clumps, ellipsoidal to subglobose. These morphological characteristics were consistent with Fusarium spp. (Leslie et al. 2006). For molecular identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), translation elongation factor subunit 1-alpha (TEF1-\u03b1) and RNA polymerase\u2161subunit 2 (RPB2) genes were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4, EF1/EF2 and 5F2/7cR respectively and sequenced (White et al. 1990; Jiang et al. 2018; O'Donnell et al. 2007). Sequences were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers OM078499 (ITS), Accession OM638086 (TEF1-\u03b1) and OM638085 (RPB2). BLAST analysis showed that ITS, TEF1-\u03b1 and RPB2 sequences shared 100%, 99.8%, 99.2% identity to F. equiseti (OM956073, KY081599, MW364892) in GenBank, respectively. In addition, ITS, TEF1-\u03b1 and RPB2 sequences shared 100%, 99.53%, 100% identity with Fusarium lacertarum (LC7927, Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti species complex) in the Fusarium-ID database. Based on the morphological characteristics and molecular sequences, the isolates were identified as Fusarium equiseti. A pathogenicity test was performed on potted lily ('White planet') under greenhouse conditions (25\u00b11\u2103 with a 16 h light and 8 h dark cycle). Three healthy lily bulbs were selected and one bulb was planted in each pot filled with sterilized soil. Each pot was inoculated with 5 mL of conidia suspension (1\u00d7107 conidia/mL) in te soil around bulbs with a stem length of 3 cm, with an equal amount of sterilized water as a control. This test had three replicates. After 15 days of inoculation, typical symptoms of bulb rotten, like those observed in the greenhouse and fields, developed on the inoculated plants but not on the controls. The same fungus was consistently reisolated from the diseased plants. To our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst report that F. equiseti caused bulb rot on Lilium in China. Our result should help with future monitoring and control of lily wilt disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhongguancun South Street 12th, Haidian District, BeijingBeijng, China, 100081; yangpanpan@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Panpan", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijng, China; hzhdeyxx@163.com."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Zehui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijng, China; 82101202262@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Yuxiao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijng, China; lrui1118@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijng, China; xuleifeng@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Leifeng", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beijng, China; zhangkezhongbua@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Kezhong", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No. 12, Zhongguancun South StreetBeijing, China, 100081; mingjun@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Ming", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37196152", "10.1094/PDIS-01-23-0199-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
