Crude preparations were subjected to different steps of purification like chromatography on Sephadex G-100 and DEAE-Sephadex. The antiviral activity of G-100 and DEAE fractions was fully conserved, whereas contaminating proteins were lost. Two types of cytotoxicity tests were performed with the different fractions. Two-fold serial dilutions of each of them were added to preformed monolayers of Vero or BHK-21 cells and cellular viability was tested. While crude extracts were toxic at low dilutions (less than or equal to 1:10), G-100 and DEAE fractions were not. The other cytotoxicity assay consisted in seeding the cells in the presence of different concentrations of each fraction. G-100 fraction affected cell growth at low dilutions (less than or equal to 1:5), while DEAE fraction did not. It should be remarked that the purification procedure rendered a partial purified DEAE fraction with an increased specific activity (antiviral activity/mg of protein). It is concluded that an antiviral factor devoid of toxicity exists in M. azedarach L extracts, which exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Andrei", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Coto", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Torres", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Ensayos de citotoxicidad y actividad antiviral de extractos crudos y semipurificados de hojas verdes de Melia azedarach L."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Argentina", "MedlineTA": "Rev Argent Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8002834", "ISSNLinking": "0325-7541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arenaviruses, New World"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Argentina"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesviridae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Poliovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sindbis Virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2825236"]}}]}
