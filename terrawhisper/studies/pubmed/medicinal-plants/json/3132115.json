High interferon inducing activity of the known inductors such as concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin and lentil lectin was asserted. It was shown that aqueous and alcoholic extracts of legumes seeds were also able to induce interferon synthesis in cultures of human peripheral blood leukocytes. By physicochemical properties such as stability to acids and liability to heating and by antigenic properties, interferon produced under such conditions was of type 2 (gamma). The maximum yield of interferon was observed in stationary and roller leukocyte cultures at a density of 2.10(6)-4.10(6) cells/ml on commercial rich media (IMDM and Eagle medium). Dynamics of gamma-interferon biosynthesis was determined. The peak of interferon production after the leukocyte induction with plant lectins was recorded in 72-96 hours."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vintukhov", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iovlev", "ForeName": "V I", "Initials": "VI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stepanov", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smorodintsev", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Poluchenie i osnovnye biologicheskie svo\u012dstva gamma-interferona cheloveka."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Antibiot Khimioter", "NlmUniqueID": "8803688", "ISSNLinking": "0235-2990"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon Inducers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82115-62-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Interferon-gamma"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interferon Inducers"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interferon-gamma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3132115"]}}]}
