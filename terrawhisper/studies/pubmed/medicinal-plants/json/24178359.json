The regeneration potential of callus was retained for more than 2 years on the nutrient medium supplemented with comparatively lower levels of growth regulators (2,4-D at 2 mg/l, NAA at 0.1 mg/l and Kn at 0.25 mg/l). Approximately 30-35 plantlets were produced after two months of culture per 100 mg of callus inoculated. Regenerants were transplanted into soil and transferred to the field for assessment of various morphological and biochemical characteristics. The results of 1 year of field trials showed that plants derived from somatic embryoids were more uniform in all the characteristics examined when compared with the field performance of plants raised through slips by standard propagation procedures. Thus, a procedure has been developed for high frequency long term plant production of lemongrass through in vitro methods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Division, Regional Research Laboratory, Bhubaneswar - 751 013 (Orissa), India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Debata", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sahoo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Planta Med. 1988 Apr;54(2):152-5", "ArticleIdList": ["17265226"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 1990 Apr;56(2):239-40", "ArticleIdList": ["17221407"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1989 Dec;8(8):483-5", "ArticleIdList": ["24233534"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1986 Oct;5(5):319-21", "ArticleIdList": ["24248287"]}, {"Citation": "Planta Med. 1988 Apr;54(2):155-6", "ArticleIdList": ["17265227"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24178359", "10.1007/BF00232373"]}}]}
