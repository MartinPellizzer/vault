Their chemical structures and absolute configurations were elucidated by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and the modified Mosher's method. Previous studies constructed Hep3B cells stably transfected with pSTAT3-Luc plasmid containing STAT3 binding site to discover STAT3 inhibitors from natural products. The STAT3 inhibitory activities of all isolates were measured in transfected Hep3B cells after treatment with IL-6. Compound 5: ((5<i>R</i>)-1,7-Bis(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-methoxy-1-hepten-5-ol), demethoxycurcumin (7: ), and curcumin (8: ) exhibited significant inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> values: 11.1, 1.9, and 1.6\u2009\u00b5M, respectively). Furthermore, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3, and the mRNA expression levels of inflammation-related genes such as CRP, IL-1\u03b2, ICAM-1, and SOCS3 were significantly reduced by exposure to compound 5: . These data suggested that the inhibitory activity of 5: is associated with the suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation. Thus, compound 5: may be a promising candidate for the treatment of cancer or inflammatory diseases related to the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Hyun-Jae", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Eun-Jae", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seung-Jae", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Hyung-Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "Jin Ha", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seung Woong", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunoregulatory Material Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Jeongeup-si, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Rho", "ForeName": "Mun-Chual", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diarylheptanoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "STAT3 Transcription Factor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarylheptanoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "STAT3 Transcription Factor"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30096715", "10.1055/a-0668-0962"]}}]}
