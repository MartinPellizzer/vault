His father, who was of Scottish ancestry, had a long association with James Hamilton, Earl of Clanbrassil who had acquired the castle in Killyleagh and extensive estates in east Down. The Hamilton family took an interest in the education of the Sloane children, and much of the early tuition of Hans was conducted within the library of Killyleagh Castle. In 1679 he moved to London to study medicine and botany. In 1683, he continued his studies in Paris and Montpellier, and graduated from the University of Orange. On his return to London, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Sydenham. In 1687 he was appointed physician to the Duke of Albemarle and surgeon to the West Indies fleet. While in Jamaica he added countless specimens to his collections, continuing a lifetime passion. He also invented milk chocolate there. Following the untimely death of the duke, he returned to London and built up a fashionable medical practice. He married Elizabeth Langley, heiress of a wealthy city alderman, and widow of a sugar planter in Jamaica. They set up house in Great Russell Street. The family home accommodated his burgeoning collections of books, specimens and curiosities. In 1685 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, later becoming the honorary secretary and president. Following his death, his collections were bought for the nation and formed the foundation of the British Museum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Royal Group of Hospitals, The Belfast Trust, Grosvenor Road, Belfast BT12 6BA , s.hawkins@qub.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hawkins", "ForeName": "Stanley A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Portrait"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Northern Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Ulster Med J", "NlmUniqueID": "0417367", "ISSNLinking": "0041-6193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "London"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scotland"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Sloane", "ForeName": "Hans", "Initials": "H"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Brooks ESJ.
