It is characterized by the presence of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau-associated neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Apart from AD, microtubule (MT)-associated protein Tau is also involved in other neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies, including Pick's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. The recent unsuccessful phase III clinical trials related to A\u03b2- targeted therapeutic drugs have indicated that alternative targets, such as Tau, should be studied to discover more effective and safer drugs. Recent drug discovery approaches to reduce AD-related Tau pathologies are primarily based on blocking Tau aggregation, inhibiting Tau phosphorylation, compensating impaired Tau function with MT-stabilizing agents, and targeting the degradation pathways in neuronal cells to degrade Tau protein aggregates. Owing to several limitations of the currently available Tau-directed drugs, further studies are required to generate further effective and safer Tau-based disease-modifying drugs. Here, we review the studies focused on medicinal plant- derived compounds capable of modulating the Tau protein, which is significantly elevated and hyperphosphorylated in AD and other tauopathies. We have mainly considered the studies focused on Tau protein as a therapeutic target. We have reviewed several pertinent papers retrieved from PubMed and ScienceDirect using relevant keywords, with a primary focus on the Tau-targeting compounds from medicinal plants. These compounds include indolines, phenolics, flavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids, and iridoids, which have been scientifically proven to be Tau-targeting candidates for the treatment of AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycobiology and Neurodegenerative Disease Research Lab, Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Durairajan", "ForeName": "Siva Sundara Kumar", "Initials": "SSK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycobiology and Neurodegenerative Disease Research Lab, Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Selvarasu", "ForeName": "Karthikeyan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycobiology and Neurodegenerative Disease Research Lab, Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Bera", "ForeName": "Minu Rani", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mycobiology and Neurodegenerative Disease Research Lab, Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur, India."}], "LastName": "Rajaram", "ForeName": "Kaushik", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mr. & Mrs. Ko Chi-Ming Centre for Parkinson's Disease Research, School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Iyaswamy", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mr. & Mrs. Ko Chi-Ming Centre for Parkinson's Disease Research, School of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong SAR, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "101467997", "ISSNLinking": "1874-4672"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tau Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tauopathies"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "tau Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "50"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34488602", "10.2174/1874467214666210906125318", "CMP-EPUB-117704"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
