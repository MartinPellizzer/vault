Phytochemicals are pure phytoconstituents of plants, mainly responsible for their therapeutic potential and pharmacological activities. Natural products isolated from medicinal plants have been used as a lead source of drug. Norisoboldine is an important isoquinoline alkaloid found to be present in the dry root of <i>Lindera aggregate</i>.", "In the present paper, scientific data of norisoboldine have been collected from Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus and analyzed in order to know the biological potential and therapeutic effectiveness of norisoboldine in medicine. Scientific data of medicinal importance and therapeutic potential of norisoboldine has been collected and analyzed in the present work. Moreover, all the collected scientific data have been separated into different sub-section <i>i.e.</i> Medicinal importance, pharmacological activities and analytical aspects. Detailed pharmacological activity data of norisoboldine have been analyzed in the present work to know the therapeutic effectiveness of norisoboldine in medicine. Analytical data of norisoboldine have also been collected and analyzed in the present work.", "Scientific data analysis revealed the biological importance of isoquinoline alkaloids in medicine. Isoquinoline alkaloids are pure, active phytochemical present in several natural edible products including vegetables, plants, and fruits. Norisoboldine has a biological effect on arthritis, colitis, apoptosis, osteoclast differentiation, inflammatory pain, renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, acute lung injury, pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor, regulatory T cells, and endothelial cell migration. However nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of norisoboldine has also been prepared in order to get better therapeutic value. Further analytical parameters of norisoboldine were also discussed in the present work in order to get the scientific information of separation, isolation and identification parameter of norisoboldine.", "Present work revealed the therapeutic potential of norisoboldine in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8138-6379"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Bioanal Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "9918418288306676", "ISSNLinking": "2949-6810"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "norisoboldine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37711013", "10.2174/2949681016666230914103740", "DMBL-EPUB-134527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
