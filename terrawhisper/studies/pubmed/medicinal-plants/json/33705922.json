(Convolvulaceae) had received growing attention as a traditional medicinal herb widely used for treating female impotence, abortion, male reproductive system disease and cardiovascular diseases, respectively.", "The present study investigated the acute and sub-acute toxicities of C. chinensis water extract (CLW) in the ICR mice model.", "Various doses of CLW (1250, 2500, and 5000\u00a0mg/kg) were administered consecutively for 14 days to evaluate the acute toxicity level with examine mortality, general behavior, body weight, food and water intake of the mice. At the end of treatmet, macroscopic observation of the skin and major internal organs in the abdominal part and organ coefficients were taken. The same doses were administered daily for 28 days to determine the sub-acute toxicity level with examine mortality, general behavior, body weight, food and water intake of the mice. At the end of treatmet, macroscopical examination of organs, tissues, cavities, organ coefficients, pathology, hematological and biochemical parameters were carried out.", "The acute toxicity test results revealed an LD <sub>50</sub> of over 5000\u00a0mg/kg for CLW. Similarly, no CLW-related mortality and severe toxicities were experienced in the sub-acute study. However, the treatment of CLW had a reducing effect on body weight of both male and female mice, and feed intake in female mice at the all tested doses (1250, 2500 and 5000\u00a0mg/kg). Moreover, significant effects in organ coefficients of brain, liver, lung, testis and thymus became apparent due to CLW mainly at the 2500 and 5000\u00a0mg/kg. The hematological analysis result showed a significant decrease in platelets, lymphocytes, and hematocrit. In contrast, a significant increase in the neutrophils was observed in the CLW treated groups (2500 and 5000\u00a0mg/kg). Biochemical test results showed a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase levels while decreasing albumin, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels after treatment of CLW mostly at the doses of 2500 and 5000\u00a0mg/kg. Mild liver toxicity in both sexes treated with 5000\u00a0mg/kg of CLW was recorded in the histopathological analysis.", "Overall, our results suggested that CLW is safe at its dose lower than 1250\u00a0mg/kg, although liver toxicity from daily use may be a matter of concern."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
