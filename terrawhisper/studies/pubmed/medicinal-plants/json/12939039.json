In addition, the known triterpene lup-20(29)-en-3-one was obtained. Structure elucidation was based on 1D and 2D NMR studies, as well as on data derived from mass spectrometry. The four acylphloroglucinol derivatives were evaluated for their cytotoxic and antibacterial activity. All compounds showed moderate cytotoxic activity against KB and Jurkat T cancer cells. Especially compounds 3 and 4 exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against different Gram-positive strains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Chemistry and Applied BioSciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winkelmann", "ForeName": "Karin", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "San", "ForeName": "Metin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kypriotakis", "ForeName": "Zacharias", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Skaltsa", "ForeName": "Helen", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bosilij", "ForeName": "Blazenka", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heilmann", "ForeName": "J\u00f6rg", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzopyrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Benzopyrans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jurkat Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "KB Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12939039", "10.1515/znc-2003-7-814"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
