Three-month-old C57BL/6 mice were initially divided into three groups, namely, control (C), high-fat (HF), and coffee prevention (HF-CP) groups, and the HF group was subdivided at the end of the 10th week into two subgroups, an HF group and a coffee treatment (HF-CT) group; thus, a total of four groups were investigated at the 14th week of the experiment. The HF-CP group had lower body mass than the HF group (-7%, P < .05) and a better distribution of adipose tissue. Both groups that received coffee (HF-CP and HF-CT) showed improved glucose metabolism compared with the HF group. Coffee consumption also attenuated adipose tissue inflammation and showed decreased macrophage infiltration and lower IL-6 levels compared with the HF group (HF-CP: -337% %, P < .05; HF-CT: -275%, P < .05). Hepatic steatosis and inflammation were attenuated in the HF-CP and HF-CT groups. The HF-CP group showed more pronounced expression of genes involved in adaptive thermogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis (PPAR\u03b3, Prdm16, Pcg1\u03b1, \u03b23-adrenergic receptor, Ucp-1, and Opa-1) than the other experimental groups. Preventive coffee consumption associated with a high-fat diet ameliorates the metabolic profile related to the development of obesity and its comorbidities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
