Sterilization should be achieved by the addition of oligodynamic silver. The indications given are: precancerous conditions, postoperative tumour prevention, operable tumours, and inoperable tumours. Each of the eight preparations (according to host-tree) has its own list of indications. Iscucin is supposed to be injected close to the tumour between 5 and 7 p. m.; the dosage and the frequency depend on body temperature. The annual costs of Iscucin treatment are DM 140.- to 280.-, not including doctor's visits, homeopathic drugs and special diet. Koehler began to develop Iscucin in 1958 on the basis of a personal communication of Steiner made in 1924. It is produced and distributed by Wala-Heilmittel GmbH, Eckw\u00e4lden. Most Wala publications have been written by H. H. Vogel, the medical advisor of Wala. Vogel combines Fromme's mesenchymal theories with the anthroposophical ideas on carcinoma development in that he designates the mesenchyma as the organic vehicle of the 'ethereal body' (Atherleib). Carcinomas develop on depletion of the mesenchymal forces; mistletoe, on the other hand, activates the mesenchyma. No preclinical or clinical investigations are available. However, the performance of controlled clinical studies is hardly possible, since the supportive measures considered to be essential cannot be applied according to a specific schedule.
