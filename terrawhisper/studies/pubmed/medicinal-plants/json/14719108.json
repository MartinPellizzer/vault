Many components from dietary or medicinal plants have been identified that possess substantial chemopreventive properties. Curcuma, a yellow pigment from Curcuma longa, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidative properties. Although its precise mode of action has not been elucidated so far, studies have shown that chemopreventive action of curcuma might be due to its ability to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. This original study was conducted in order to estimate whether curcuma enhances the radiation sensitivity of cancer cells. For this purpose, curcuma (concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 microM) was applied to human cancer cell cultures (HeLa, K-562 and IM-9) with or without X-irradiation (doses comprised between 0 and 8 Gy). Cell proliferation was monitored by trypan blue exclusion. For the estimation of apoptosis, changes in cell morphology and flow cytometry analysis (DNA content and presence of the sub-G1 peak) were performed. Microscopic examination of the curcuma-treated cells (with concentrations above 100 microM) showed a characteristic morphology of apoptosis. Furthermore, cells treated with curcuma exhibited a sub-G1 peak from which the magnitude was proportional to the concentration of curcuma. X-irradiation alone induced polyploidisation and apoptosis of the three cell lines, proportional to the doses of irradiation with a marked difference in radiation sensitivity between the cell lines (IM-9 < K-562 < HELA). However, when radiation and curcuma were applied together, our results showed that in HELA, K-562 and IM-9, curcuma showed a radiation sensitising effect only at the dose of 200 micro M. This result may open a perspective of synergical therapy at the condition to also address the intrinsic toxicity of curcuma on normal cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Radiobiology, Belgian Nuclear Research Center, SCK-CEN, B-2400 Mol, Belgium. sbaatout@sckcen.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baatout", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Derradji", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jacquet", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ooms", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michaux", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mergeay", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Int J Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9306042", "ISSNLinking": "1019-6439"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K562 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyploidy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14719108", "10.3892/ijo.24.2.321"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
