Chromosomal damage by carcinogens to dividing basal cells of the epithelium results in the production of micronuclei in the daughter cells which migrate up through the epithelium and are exfoliated. Exfoliated cells can be readily obtained from several tissues, including the oral buccal mucosa (scrapings of oral cells), bronchi (sputum), urinary bladder and ureter (centrifugation of urine), cervix (smears) and esophagus (imprints from biopsies). The micronucleus test on exfoliated cells has been successfully used to: (1) recognize population groups at an elevated risk for cancer of the oral cavity or urinary bladder; (2) estimate synergistic or additive effects of carcinogen exposure (cigarette smokers plus drinkers of alcoholic beverages); (3) pinpoint the site within an organ from which most carcinomas will develop (oral cancers among 'inverted' smokers in the Philippines). The possibility that this assay may also serve as a rapid monitor for chemopreventive agents is suggested by a preliminary trial on the effect of vitamin A/beta--carotene dietary supplementation among 33 betel quid chewers in the Philippines. These individuals received sealed capsules of retinol (100,000 IU/week) and beta-carotene (300,000 IU/week) for a 3-month period. At the end of this time, the frequencies of micronucleated buccal mucosa cells were reduced from an average of 4.2% to 1.4%. No changes were observed in micronucleus frequencies among 11 betel quid chewers not receiving vitamin pills. Non- chewers of betel quid in this population had a micronucleus frequency of 0.5%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "H F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosin", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philippines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Racial Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6713365", "10.1016/0304-3835(84)90159-9", "0304-3835(84)90159-9"]}}]}
