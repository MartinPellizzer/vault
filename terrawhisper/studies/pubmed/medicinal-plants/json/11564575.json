Variable results of p53 expression have been reported and it has been proposed that ethnic difference and a variation in the indigenous oral habit may be responsible for the finding. This study, therefore, investigated p53 expression among 106 OSCC patients from a southern Thailand population in which all four risk behaviours, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, betel quid chewing and use of smokeless tobacco, are practised. The associations of p53 expression with lifetime exposure to each risk behaviour were explored. Multivariate modelling showed that lifetime exposure to alcohol drinking was significantly positively associated with p53 expression (likelihood ratio P value 0.01). Betel quid chewing and tobacco smoking habit showed a trend of decreasing risk of p53 expression with increased lifetime exposure (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-1.00 and OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.98, respectively). No significant association was found between p53 expression and clinico-pathological parameters. Further investigations are needed to study (1) the molecular alteration of p53 in each risk habit and (2) other possible pathways of oral carcinogenesis in betel quid- and tobacco smoking-associated OSCC in these group of patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, Faculty of Dentistry, Prince of Songkla University, Haad Yai, Songkhla 90012, Thailand. kduangpo@ratree.psu.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kerdpon", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sriplung", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kietthubthew", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Oral Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9709118", "ISSNLinking": "1368-8375"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neoplasm Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multivariate Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11564575", "10.1016/s1368-8375(00)00120-2", "S1368837500001202"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
