The polysaccharide fraction, CZ-1-III, at dose of 6.25 mg/kg/d showed 50% inhibition in solid tumor growth. When mice were injected with fractions, CZ-1 and CZ-1-III, at the dose of 100.0 mg/kg, 91.6% and 97.1% of tumor growth were inhibited, respectively, indicating that the cytotoxic effect of polysaccharide on sarcoma 180 cells increases upon increasing the amount of polysaccharide administered. To assess the genotoxicity of CZ-1-III fraction, several classical toxicological tests were performed. In Ames test, CZ-1-III did not show any transformation of revertant with or without S-9 metabolic activating system, indicating the lack of mutagenic effect of the compound. To assess clastogenic effect, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays were performed using Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblast cells. However, up to 259.0 microg/ml concentration of CZ-1-III, neither micronucleus formation nor chromosomal aberration was induced regardless of the presence of S-9 metabolic activating system. Inhibition of CZ-1-III on micronucleus formation induced by mitomycin C was exhibited in a dose-dependent manner, maximally up to 52.0%. These results strongly suggest that CZ-1-III, the polysaccharide fraction from C. Zedoaria, decreases tumor size of mouse and prevents chromosomal mutation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul. kikim69@hanmail.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K I", "Initials": "KI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "B S", "Initials": "BS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cells", "NlmUniqueID": "9610936", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8478"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcoma 180"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10987135", "S1016-8478(23)17492-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
