It has been identified as an important medicinal tree due to its antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory properties (Singh et al., 2009; Thite et al., 2014). In March 2021, leaf spots were observed on Banyan trees in the Kharian forest zone, District Gujrat, Punjab Province, Pakistan. Initial symptoms on leaves were irregular, water-soaked, and light brown lesions. The lesions turned dark brown at the centre, and the margins gradually turned yellow. The average size of lesions was 12 to 20 \u00d7 8 to 13 mm. The lesions coalesced and produced necrotic areas on the leaf (Figure 1). Samples (n=34) were collected based on symptoms and infected leaf segments were excised into small pieces (10-20 mm), surface disinfected with 1% NaClO for 10 seconds and rinsed three times with sterilized distilled water (SDW). Ten pieces/sample were mashed and soaked in 1.5 ml SDW to obtain a suspension. Later, 10 \u00b5L of the suspension was streaked on Nutrient agar (NA) and King's B medium (KBM) and incubated for 72 h at 30\u00b0C. After 72 h bacterial colonies appeared on NA and KBM medium. Each colony was re-streaked for three times to obtain the purified colonies. Morphological and biochemical characteristics of isolated bacterial cultures were performed by following the method of Schaad et al. (2001). Bacterial colonies appeared pale yellow to creamy, smooth, and circular with undulated margins on both NA and KBM medium. The colonies produced a fluorescent blue colour on KBM under the UV light. Isolated bacterial cultures were positive for oxidase, negative for levan production and arginine dihydrolase. Based on these characteristics, the pathogen was identified as Pseudomonas species. For molecular identification, 16S rRNA and rpoB genes were amplified and sequenced using the following primers: 27F/1492R (Lane, 1991) and LAPS/LAPS27 (Ait Tayeb et al. 2005), respectively. All the isolates were identified as P. cichorii after BLASTn analysis. The sequences of isolate BLS-01 obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank with accession No. OK397593 for 16S rRNA and OK423684 for rpoB exhibiting 100 % similarity with P. cichorii Accession No. MK356431 for 16S rRNA and JQ267563 for rpoB. A pathogenicity test was performed on healthy Banyan seedlings to fulfil Koch's postulates. Leaves from seedling plants were inoculated with 3 mL of BLS-01 suspension (108 CFU/ml) by spraying the inoculum on leaves using a sterilized spray bottle. The leaves sprayed with sterilized distilled water served as control (Figure 2). The experiment was performed three times following the same protocol as described above. Symptoms that appeared on inoculated leaves after 7-10 days were similar to the symptoms observed on original infected Banyan tree leaves in the forest zone. Control leaves remained asymptomatic during the whole experiment. The pathogen from the artificial infected leaves was re-isolated and identified as P. cichorii based on morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot of F. benghalensis caused by P. cichorii in Pakistan."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Agriculture Faisalabad, 66724, Department of plant pathology, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 12661, Institiute of Food Sciencea and Technology, Haidian District, Beijing, China; tanvirahmad_01@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Tanvir", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan University, 47868, School of Food Science and Engineering /South China Food Safety Research center, Foshan, Guangdong, China; liguoqiang@fosu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Guoqiang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan University, 47868, School of Food Science and Engineering, Foshan, Guangdong, China; w_j2010@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan University, 47868, School of Food Science and Engineering /South China Food Safety Research center, Foshan, Guangdong, China; 1003946085@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mingxuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Macau University of Science and Technology, 58816, Taipa, Macau, China; yxiao@must.edu.mo."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Macau University of Science and Technology, 58816, Taipa, Macau, China; xyu@must.edu.mo."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Institute of Plant Protection, 243827, State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests , Beijing, Beijing, China; yqzheng@ippcaas.cn."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yongquan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Agriculture Faisalabad, 66724, Plant Pathology, Department of Plant Pathology 38040 University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan, 38040; annu_77@live.com."}], "LastName": "Moosa", "ForeName": "Anam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan University, 47868, School of Food Science and Engineering, Foshan, Guangdong, China; niecr@126.com."}], "LastName": "Chengrong", "ForeName": "Nie", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Foshan University, 47868, School of Food Science and Engineering, No.33 Guangyun Road, Shishan town, Nanhai District, Foshan, China, 528000; liuyang@fosu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yang", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35536210", "10.1094/PDIS-12-21-2668-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
