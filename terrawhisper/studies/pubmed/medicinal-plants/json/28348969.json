The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of <i>Kelussia odoratissima</i> (<i>K. odoratissima</i>) extract associated with radiotherapy in cervical cancer cells (HeLa cell line).", "Different concentration of the extract (25-500\u00b5g/ml) was tested in HeLa cell lines. Cell cytotoxicity of the extract and the effects of the extract on radiation (2Gy/min)-induced damages were assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometric analysis.", "<i>K. odoratissima</i> decreased cell viability in HeLa cell line in a concentration and time-dependent manner. When compared to the control, <i>K. odoratissima</i> induced a sub-G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells, indicating that apoptotic cell death is involved in <i>K. odoratissima</i>-induced toxicity. It was also shown that <i>K. odoratissima</i> sensitizes cells to radiation-induced toxicity.", "Our result showed the extract increased the radiation effect. This observation may be related to the presence of active compounds such as phthalides and ferulic acid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saeidi Javadi", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oncology, Omid Hospitsal, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fani-Pakdel", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, MashhadUniversity of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran ; Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mousavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Hadi", "Initials": "SH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Avicenna J Phytomed", "NlmUniqueID": "101586220", "ISSNLinking": "2228-7930"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Ahmadi F, Kadima M, Shahedi M.
