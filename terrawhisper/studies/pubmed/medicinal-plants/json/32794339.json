Conventional treatment and preventions such as antibiotics and Bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine can be unreliable. In view of the increasing prevalence of anti-TB drug resistance, adjunctive therapy may be necessary to shorten the recovery time. We have previously shown that flavonoids in the medicinal herb Sophora flavescens exhibit anti-inflammatory and bactericidal activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular and cellular characteristics of flavonoids of S. flavescens (FSF) in BCG-stimulated macrophages for assessing their roles in anti-inflammation and autophagy. Mouse alveolar macrophage (MH-S) cell line and primary mouse peritoneal macrophages were stimulated in vitro with heat-inactivated BCG and treated with FSF, with or without autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). Gene expression was analyzed using quantitative PCR, and cytokine/chemokine release was analyzed by Milliplex assay and ELISA. Autophagy-related proteins were quantified by Western blot and flow cytometry, and autophagolysosomes were detected using fluorescence microscopy. In both MH-S cell line and mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated by heat-inactivated BCG, FSF was found to up-regulate autophagy-related proteins microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) and protein 62 (p62), and suppress the induced proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, CCL5, and IL-6. FSF actively modulates immune processes through suppressing BCG-mediated inflammation by promoting autophagy in MH-S cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages. We suggest that FSF may be useful as an adjunctive therapeutic agent for TB infection by modulating cell survival through autophagy and reducing inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92020 Society for Leukocyte Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Kan", "ForeName": "Lea Ling-Yu", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dehua", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Ben Chung-Lap", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Tsang", "ForeName": "Miranda Sin-Man", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Tianheng", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Leung", "ForeName": "Ping Chung", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicines, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."}], "LastName": "Lam", "ForeName": "Christopher Wai-Kei", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5637-8331"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Research on Bioactivities and Clinical Applications of Medicinal Plants, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin R & D Centre for Chinese Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China."}], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Chun Kwok", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Leukoc Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8405628", "ISSNLinking": "0741-5400"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monokines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Autophagy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Monokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium bovis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Global tuberculosis report.
