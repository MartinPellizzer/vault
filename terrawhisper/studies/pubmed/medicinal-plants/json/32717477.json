All the target compounds were screened for inhibitory activity against PI3K\u03b1 and mTOR kinases. Notably, most analogs exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> in the nanomolar range. Investigation of the isozyme selectivity indicated that the compounds exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity against PI3K\u03b4, especially compound 19f showed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.3\u00a0nM for PI3K\u03b4 and moderate \u03b4-isozyme selectivity over other class I PI3K isoforms and mTOR (with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 14.6, 34.0, 849.0 and 15.4\u00a0nM for PI3K\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and mTOR, respectively). An in\u00a0vitro MTT assay was conducted to assess the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of the prepared analogs. It was revealed that the compounds displayed significant inhibitory activities against the HCT116 human colon cancer cell line. Compound 19i showed 4.7-fold higher potency than the positive control gedatolisib (0.3 vs. 1.4\u00a0\u03bcM, IC<sub>50</sub> values). Phosphoblot studies demonstrated that 19c and 19i could significantly suppress the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway at 10\u00a0\u03bcM. Moreover, analogs 19b, 19c and 19i displayed better stability in artificial gastric fluids than gedatolisib, while 19i was indicated not very stable in rat liver microsomes, and may occur phase I metabolic transformations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
