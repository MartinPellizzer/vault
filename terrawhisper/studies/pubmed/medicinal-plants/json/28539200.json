Ellagic acid and punicalagin imprinted polymers were synthesized in batch mode and two semi-preparative MIP-SPE columns were individually packed. After investigaing \"functional complementation\", 2D-MIP-SPE was constructed using ellagic acid MIP and punicalagin MIP-SPE as the first and second dimension, respectively. Then, pomegranate husk extract was fast divided into four fractions individually enriching in ellagic acid, granatin A, punicalagin and ellagic acid glucoside by 2D-MIP-SPE. With the aid of crystallization and RPLC, ellagic acid (13.5mg) and punicalagin (53.4mg) were fast obtained in 30min. Ellagic acid glucoside was purified to the purity near 100% with a recovery of 86.1%. Granatin A (92%) was directly obtained by 2D-MIP-SPE with the recovery of 81.8%. All above indicated that 2D-MIP-SPE was highly efficient in natural product purification. The concept of \"functional complementation\" was expected to be a useful tool in the construction of 2D-MIP-SPE."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
