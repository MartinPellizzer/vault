Photochemical profiles, as well as pharmaceutical activities of <i>Centella asiatica</i> (L.), one of the most valuable medicinal plants, divulge the presence of secondary metabolites called Centellosides. Despite well-studied pharmaceutical activities, not much is known about the genes responsible for the synthesis of these compounds. In the present study, the full-length DXR gene sequence (JQ965955) of <i>Centella</i> submitted in NCBI was characterized using various bioinformatics tools and tissue specific differential expression studies were also carried out. The full-length CDNA of CaDXR contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1425\u00a0bp which encodes a peptide of 474 amino acids. The molecular weight of this protein was found to be 51.5\u00a0kDa with isoelectric point of 6.33<i>.</i> The protein contains three conserved domain, namely NADPH (GSTGSIGT and LAAGSNV), substrate binding (LPADSEHSAI and NKGLEVIEAHY) and Cys-Ser-(Ala/Met/Val/Thr) cleavage-site domains. Phylogenetic studies of CaDXR sequence show close homology with DXR sequence of <i>Angelica sinensis</i> and <i>Daucus carota</i> subsp sativus as they all belong to Apiaceae family. In silico analysis predicted that CaDXR protein contains 21 \u03b1-helix and 11 \u03b2-sheets and further DXR protein model was validated by Ramachandran plot analysis. The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations unveil dynamic stability of the proposed model and docking studies suggest that the NDP cofactor tightly binds in the active site of the protein with a strong network of hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. The expression studies by semi-RT followed by qRT-PCR suggests that CaDXR is differentially expressed in different tissues (with maximal expression in the node and lowest in the roots). Thus, characterization and structure-function analysis of DXR gene in <i>Centella</i> facilitate us to understand not only the functions of DXR gene but also regulatory mechanisms involved in the MEP pathway in <i>C. asiatica</i> plant at the molecular level.", "The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-02723-w."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology 2021."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411459.c", "0000 0000 9205 417X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, 785013 India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Richa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411459.c", "0000 0000 9205 417X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, 785013 India."}], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Kamalakshi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411459.c", "0000 0000 9205 417X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, 785013 India."}], "LastName": "Modi", "ForeName": "Mahendra K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2962-9278"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["grid.411459.c", "0000 0000 9205 417X"], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, 785013 India."}], "LastName": "Sen", "ForeName": "Priyabrata", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "3 Biotech", "NlmUniqueID": "101565857", "ISSNLinking": "2190-5738"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interestWe wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aziz ZA, Davey MR, Power JB, Anthony P, Smith RM, Lowe KC.
