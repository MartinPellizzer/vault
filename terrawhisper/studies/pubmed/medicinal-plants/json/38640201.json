Data of 40 sertraline and 40 citalopram recipients with equal representation of males and females assigned to each medication were analyzed, while their baseline characteristics were not statistically different (P\u2005>\u20050.05). There were no significant differences between sertraline and citalopram recipients in outcome changes (P\u2005>\u20050.05), all of which indicated improvement, but a significant time-treatment-sex interaction effect in BDNF levels was observed (P\u2005=\u20050.035). Regarding this, subgroup analyses illustrated a significantly greater increase in male BDNF levels following sertraline treatment (P\u2005=\u20050.020) with a moderate to large effect size (Cohen's d\u2005=\u20050.76 and ). Significant associations were observed between percentage changes in IL-6 levels and BDNF levels in sertraline recipients (P\u2005=\u20050.033) and HDRS scores in citalopram recipients (P\u2005<\u20050.001). Sex was an effect modifier in BDNF alterations following sertraline and citalopram administration.
