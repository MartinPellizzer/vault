In the present study, we have explored the pharmacological and toxicological profile of coumarinolignoids isolated from <i>Cleome viscose</i> for the management of rheumatoid arthritis and related complications in a small animal model. To avoid the biasness during experiments on animals, we have coded the isolated coumarinolignoids as <i>CLIV-92</i> to perform the experimental pharmacological study. <i>CLIV-92</i> was orally administrated (30,100, 300\u2009mg/kg) to animal models of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), carrageenan-induced acute inflammation, thermal and chemical-induced pain, and Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia. Oral administration of <i>CLIV-92</i> significantly decreases the arthritis index, arthritis score, and increases the limb withdrawal threshold in the CIA model in experimental rats. The anti-arthritis studies revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of <i>CLIV-92</i> was associated with inhibition of the production of inflammatory mediators like TNF-<i>\u03b1</i>, IL-6, IL-17A, MMP-1, MMP-9, Nitric oxide, and C-RP in CIA rat's serum, and also reduced the NF<i>\u043a</i>B-p65 expression as evidence of immunohistochemistry in knee joint tissue of CIA rats, in a dose-dependent manner. Further individual experiments related to arthritis-related complications in experimental animals demonstrated the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic potential of <i>CLIV-92</i> in a dose-dependent manner. Further, an <i>in-vivo</i> acute oral toxicity study concluded that <i>CLIV-92</i> is safe in experimental animals up to 2,000\u2009mg/kg dose. The results of this study suggested that the oral administration of <i>CLIV-92</i> may be a therapeutic candidate for further investigation in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and related complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
