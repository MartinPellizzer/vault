Numerous phytochemicals from plants have shown to exert antineoplastic effects via programmed cell death (apoptosis). Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in prosperous countries. The subject study was intended to evaluate the anticancer properties of Kalonji extracts against cancer cell lines HeLa and HepG2 and normal cell lines BHK and VERO were used as normal controls.", "For the evaluation of anti-proliferative effects, cell viability and cell death in all groups of cells were evaluated via MTT, crystal violet and trypan blue assays. For the evaluation of angiogenesis, Immunocytochemistry and ELISA of VEGF were done. Immunocytochemistry and ELISA of Annexin-V and p53 were performed for the estimation of apoptosis in all groups of cells. Furthermore, LDH assay, antioxidant enzymes activity (GSH, APOX, CAT and SOD) and RT-PCR with proliferative and apoptotic markers along with internal control were also performed. Cancer cells of both cell lines HepG2 and HeLa cells showed reduced viability, angiogenesis and proliferation with increased apoptosis when treated with Kalonji extracts. Whereas anti-oxidative enzymes show enhanced levels in treated cancer cells as compared to untreated ones.", "It was observed that Kalonji extracts have the ability to induce apoptosis and improve the antioxidant status of HeLa and HepG2 cells. They can also inhibit the proliferation and angiogenesis in both these cancer cell lines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Maqbool", "ForeName": "Tahir", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Awan", "ForeName": "Sana J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Sabeen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hadi", "ForeName": "Faheem", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, University of Veterinary and Animal Science, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shehzadi", "ForeName": "Somia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (IMBB), The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "Kanza", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31433749", "10.2174/1389201020666190821144633", "CPB-EPUB-100381"]}}]}
