Castrated immature rats were randomized and divided into two groups (control and KP-treatment groups). The rats (n=7-8) were treated daily for 5 days by oral route with water in the control group and 1,000 mg/kg of KP in the treatment group. All rats were decapitated 24 h after their last dose and then blood samples were collected for assay of serum FSH, LH, testosterone, progesterone and corticosterone levels. The seminal vesicles plus coagulating glands, ventral prostate, levator ani muscle plus bulbocavernosus muscle, glans penis, kidneys and the adrenal glands were collected and weighed for organ wet weight. Body weight and weight of food intake were recorded throughout the study period. The results show that relative body weight gain in the KP-treatment group was significantly increased 24 and 48 h after the first dose (P<0.05) and then was indistinguishable from the control group. There were no significant differences in the relative reproductive and non-reproductive organ weights between the groups, although all organ weights, except for the glans penis, tended to increase in the KP-treatment group. The serum testosterone levels were significantly increased in the KP-treatment group. There were no significant differences in the serum FSH, LH, progesterone, or corticosterone levels between the groups, even though the serum progesterone level tended to increase and serum LH level tended to decrease in the KP-treatment group. The present study indicates that KP has no testosterone-like effect on reproduction in male rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trisomboon", "ForeName": "Hataitip", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Gen", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wetchasit", "ForeName": "Phongphat", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Taya", "ForeName": "Kazuyoshi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Reprod Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "9438792", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8818"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4G7DS2Q64Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Progesterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-68-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W980KJ009P", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Corticosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Genitalia, Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orchiectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Progesterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiberaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17179656", "10.1262/jrd.18092", "JST.JSTAGE/jrd/18092"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
