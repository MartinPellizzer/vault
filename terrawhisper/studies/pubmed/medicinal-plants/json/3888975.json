AB I, AB IIa, and AB IIc had molecular weights of 9,166, 8,661, and 8,756 daltons, consisting of 82, 78, 79 amino acid residues, respectively. The molecular weights of these inhibitors, determined by gel filtration at pH 8.0, were 18,000 for AB I and 17,000 for both AB IIa and AB IIc, indicating that the inhibitors are dimers. The inhibitors had isoelectric points of 4.7 (AB I), 6.8 (AB IIa), and 6.2 (AB IIc). AB I stoichiometrically inhibited both trypsin and chymotrypsin at a molar ratio of 1 : 1. On the other hand, AB IIa and AB IIc both inhibited trypsin at a molar ratio of about 1 : 2 and also inhibited chymotrypsin, though only weakly. Sequence comparison with other double-headed inhibitors indicated the reactive sites of AB IIa and AB IIc for trypsin to be Lys26-Ser27 and Arg53-Ser54, and those of AB I for trypsin and chymotrypsin to be Lys26-Ser27 and Tyr53-Ser54, respectively. The differences between AB IIa and AB IIc were that AB IIa lacked the C-terminal aspartic acid residue, and that Glu10 and Arg60 in AB IIa were replaced by Gln10 and His60 in AB IIc. A comparison between AB IIa and AB I revealed 25 variant amino acids among the 78 residues of AB IIa; further, Ab IIa lacked 4 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of AB I."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishikawa", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakata", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakagaki", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Endopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Metalloendopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.29", "NameOfSubstance": "auR protein, Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OS382OHJ8P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyanogen Bromide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyanogen Bromide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Point"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metalloendopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3888975", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a135068"]}}]}
