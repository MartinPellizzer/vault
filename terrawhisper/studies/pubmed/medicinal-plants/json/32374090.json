Both international bodies finalized a 40-hour training program to provide counseling in feeding, to teach a body of care-givers to bring qualified assistance to the breast-feeding mothers and to help them to overcome their difficulties. However, in the field and in maternities such as those where the study took place (Boucle du Mouhoun region in the northwest of Burkina Faso), although technical recommendations are generally adopted and respected, exclusive breastfeeding makes it difficult for mothers to find their way. The aim of this study is to examine the blockages existing at the maternity ward and in families which prevent the practice of exclusive breastfeeding from becoming widespread. A qualitative approach was used through open interviews with various socio-professional medical categories and community members.", "Fourteen observations were made in the families. Twenty-four observations were made on the care of the newborn at home. Thirty-eight interviews with health and administrative staff and nine interviews with healers using traditional knowledge were also conducted.", "The results show that exclusive breastfeeding is complicated to implement particularly in rural areas because of the use of medicinal plants in the form of washing and gavage. Moreover, the information is not given to mothers of families at the appropriate time.", "In conclusion, we suggest that maternities be thought out and designed in partnership with the health workers who use them."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arcens Som\u00e9", "ForeName": "Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Le d\u00e9fi de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019allaitement maternel exclusif au\u00a0Burkina Faso."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Sante Publique", "NlmUniqueID": "9216153", "ISSNLinking": "0995-3914"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breast Feeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Burkina Faso"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Counseling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Mothers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32374090", "10.3917/spub.200.0113"]}}]}
