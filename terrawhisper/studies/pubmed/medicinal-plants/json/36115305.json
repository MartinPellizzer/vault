A small amount of fluoride ions can promote the strengthen of our body. However, a large amount of fluoride ions will damage the human immune system to produce organ diseases. Sensitive and rapid detection of fluoride ions has attracted great interests for researchers. In this work, a reactive fluorescent probe SCP for detection of fluoride ions with high quantum yield was designed and synthesized based on the carbazole ring. Subsequently, the photophysical properties of the probe SCP were carefully studied. At last, SCP performed 62.8% quantum yield in physiological condition, excellent ability of quantitative analysis, well selectivity, and distinguishing features for HepG2 cell imaging."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
