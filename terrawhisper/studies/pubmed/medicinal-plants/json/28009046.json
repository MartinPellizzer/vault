These proteins are expressed as complex mixtures in plants. Although several methods have been developed for their isolation and analysis, purification of cyclotides is still a lengthy process. Here, we describe the use of affinity chromatography for the purification of cyclotides using polyclonal IgG antibodies raised in rabbits against cycloviolacin O2 and immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose columns. Cycloviolacin O2 was used as a model substance to evaluate the chromatographic principle, first as a pure compound and then in combination with other cyclotides, that is, bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O19 and M\u00f6bius cyclotide kalata B1, and in a plant extract. We demonstrate that single-step purification of cyclotides by affinity chromatography is possible but cross reactivity may occur between homologue cyclotides of the bracelet subfamily."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 574, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna, 9208, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Uddin", "ForeName": "Shaikh Jamal", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 574, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Taj", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 574, Uppsala, SE, 75123, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Shafiullah", "ForeName": "Md", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "W.
