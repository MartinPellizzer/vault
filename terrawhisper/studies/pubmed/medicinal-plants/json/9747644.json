The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma-lowering effects of 5 g t.i.d. of Plantago Psyllium, as an adjunct to dietary therapy, on lipid and glucose levels, in patients with type II diabetes. Patients were randomly selected from an outpatient clinic of primary care to participate in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which Plantago Psyllium or placebo was given in combination with a low fat diet. One hundred twenty-five subjects were included in the study that consisted in a 6-week period of diet counseling followed by a 6-week treatment period. Fasting plasma glucose, total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured every 2 weeks. The test products (Psyllium or placebo) were supplied to subjects in identically labeled foil packets containing a 5-g dose of product, to consume three doses per day (of 5 g each one), before regular meals. There was an excellent tolerance to Psyllium, without significant adverse effects. No significant changes were observed in the patient's weight for both groups (not significant). Fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides levels, showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05), whereas HDL cholesterol increased significantly (p < 0.01) following Psyllium treatment. Our results show that 5 g t.i.d. of Psyllium is useful, as an adjunct to dietary therapy, in patients with type II diabetes, to reduce plasma lipid and glucose levels, resolving the compliance conflict associated with the ingest of a great amount of fiber in customary diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mexican Social Security Institute and Research Group on Diabetes and Chronic Illnesses, Durango."}], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez-Mor\u00e1n", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guerrero-Romero", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lazcano-Burciaga", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Diabetes Complications", "NlmUniqueID": "9204583", "ISSNLinking": "1056-8727"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cathartics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cathartics"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Combined Modality Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9747644", "10.1016/s1056-8727(98)00003-8", "S1056-8727(98)00003-8"]}}]}
