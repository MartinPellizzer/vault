The treatment of PC is relatively difficult due to the difficulty in making an early diagnosis. Most PC patients are confronted with locally metastatic or advanced diseases in the asymptomatic phase, and about 80% have late diagnosis with metastasis. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have drawn attention as a novel biological regulation layer. They take part in the regulation of mRNA and can be used as a prognostic factor or drug target. Based on their functions as regulators of PC initiation and progress, the lncRNAs can be categorized as tumor suppressors or oncogenic. They can be considered as a target for finding new biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis, monitoring, and treating drug response in PC. Therefore, the present study summarizes the lncRNAs role in PC and the probable strategies to deal with their expression and controlling tumorigenesis and detection of the prognosis of PC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehrabadi", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, University of Warith Al-Anbiyaa, Karbala, Iraq."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine and Health Sciences and Technology, Sultanate of Oman."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Health, School of Biomedical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, 4000, Australia."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Cancer Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101094211", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0096"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39021192", "10.2174/0115680096300768240604045809", "CCDT-EPUB-141703"]}}]}
