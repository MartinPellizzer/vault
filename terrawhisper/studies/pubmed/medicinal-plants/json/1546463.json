The molecule is composed of 3732 nucleotide (nt) residues, exclusive of the polyadenylate at the 3' end. Only one of the six reading frame registers has a long open reading frame, from nt 255 to nt 3260 in the polarity of encapsidated RNA and corresponding to a polyprotein of 1002 amino acid residues (aa). As has been reported for other comoviruses, a second in-frame AUG, at nt position 531, apparently also initiates translation, at least in vitro. Multiple alignments of the deduced CPSMV polyprotein aa sequence with those of bean pod mottle comovirus (BPMV), cowpea mosaic comovirus (CPMV), and red clover mottle comovirus (RCMV) were consistent with a similar size for each of the three genes: the putative movement protein, beginning at the second in-frame AUG, the large coat protein (L), and the small coat protein. Identical nucleotide sequences in the terminal noncoding regions of RNA 2 of the four viruses are limited to 9 nt at the 5' end and the 3' polyadenylate. However, extensive similarities in sequence and potential structure were found. For all three genes and the 5' untranslated region, CPSMV and BPMV are more similar to each other than either is to CPMV or RCMV, the last two being similar to each other. Observed similarities predict that both cleavage sites in the CPSMV RNA 2 polyprotein are at glutamine-serine dipeptides. A sequence of 16 aa at the amino terminus of L, determined by automated Edman degradation, matched a region of the deduced aa sequence in the polyprotein and is consistent with cleavage at the predicted glutamine-serine dipeptide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bruening", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["M83309"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Structural Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Structural Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1546463", "10.1016/0042-6822(92)90471-z"]}}]}
