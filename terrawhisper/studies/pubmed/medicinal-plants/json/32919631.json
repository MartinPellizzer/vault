In this study, an attempt is made to apply oxidized Bletilla striata polysaccharide (OBSP) hydrogel as a delivery system to put up a physical barrier to probiotics. Bletilla striata, as a famous traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used for over 1500\u00a0years to promote wound healing. Firstly, probiotic-bound OBSP-Chitosan composite hydrogel (OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly approach. Subsequently, the SEM image, swelling and rheological properties of the OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel were investigated. Notably, composite probiotics to wounds are an attractive novel intervention that significantly improves the antibacterial properties of the hydrogel and avoids the pitfalls of many antibiotic therapies. Furthermore, the full-thickness skin defect model in vivo indicated an outstanding wound healing efficacy. Therefore, OBSP-CS-LP hydrogel could be applied as a promising dressing in the wound healing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
