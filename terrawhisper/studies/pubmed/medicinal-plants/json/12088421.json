An HPLC system was developed, and a large number of latex and leaf samples of C. lechleri from 22 sites in northern Peru and Ecuador were analyzed to gain an understanding of the natural variation in alkaloid content for the species. Up to six alkaloids were found to occur in the leaves including, in addition to those listed above, thaliporphine (3), glaucine (4), and taspine (9), whereas the latex contained only 9. Taspine (9) is the component that has been previously found to be responsible for the wound healing activity of C. lechleri latex, and its mean concentration throughout the range examined was found to be 9% of the latex by dry weight. In addition, three chemotypes are defined based on the alkaloid content of the leaves, and the geographic distribution of these chemotypes is discussed along with a quantitative analysis of the alkaloid content as a function of chemotype."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Washington University, Campus Box 1137, One Brookings Drive, St. Louis, Missouri 63130, USA. dmilanowski@ncifcrf.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milanowski", "ForeName": "Dennis J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Winter", "ForeName": "Rudolph E K", "Initials": "RE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Elvin-Lewis", "ForeName": "Memory P F", "Initials": "MP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "Walter H", "Initials": "WH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01TW00331", "Acronym": "TW", "Agency": "FIC NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "norisoboldine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M002E511AJ", "NameOfSubstance": "isoboldine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI8K6962K4", "NameOfSubstance": "magnoflorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colombia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Croton"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecuador"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peru"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12088421", "10.1021/np000270v", "np000270v"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
