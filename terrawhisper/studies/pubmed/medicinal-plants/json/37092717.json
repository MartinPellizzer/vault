Polyphenols are important functional components in <i>Prunus mume</i>. To obtain a more efficient extraction process of <i>Prunus mume</i> polyphenols, a single-factor test and response surface method were used. After extraction and purification, the final polyphenol content of <i>Prunus mume</i> (L<sup>1</sup>) was up to 90%. Biological experiments showed that L<sup>1</sup> had high anticancer activity against HeLa (125.28 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>), HepG2 (117.24 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>), MCF-7 (170.19 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>), and A549 (121.78 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>) <i>in vitro</i> by MTT assay. The combination of DDP and DOX significantly enhanced the anticancer activity of the four cell lines, especially L<sup>1</sup>-DOX had the smallest IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.04 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup> against HepG2 cells, indicating the combination of drugs had synergistic effects. It is further demonstrated that L<sup>1</sup> could inhibit cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis with ROS detection and confocal fluorescence images. The relative tumor proliferation rate (T/C) was 40.6%, and the tumor inhibition rate was 57.9%, indicating L<sup>1</sup> to have no significant toxicity but high anti-HepG2 activity <i>in vivo</i>. Although the study is very limited, it is anticipated to provide a reference for further exploration of the functionality of the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fruit Research Center, Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academy of Sciences (Nanjing Botanical Garden Mem.
