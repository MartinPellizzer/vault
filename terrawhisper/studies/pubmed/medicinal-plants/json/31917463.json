It is commonly used as a spice for flavoring food products and in various traditional medicine applications. This study investigated the effect of nitrogen fertilization at 0-150\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha<sup>-1</sup> on the potential bioaccessibility and activity of Greek oregano compounds. For this purpose the total phenolic content, rosmarinic acid content, and antioxidant activities of the raw material, as well as digested fractions, were determined.", "Nitrogen fertilization had a negative influence on the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of raw material; however, its effect on the potential bioaccessibility varied depending on the dose. The highest potential bioaccessibility and activity was determined for plants fertilized with 30\u2009kg\u2009N\u2009ha<sup>-1</sup> . For the gastric and intestinal phases of digestion, the potential bioaccessibility percentages were 39.5% and 29.6% for total phenolics, 53.1% and 11.2% for rosmarinic acid content, 45.2% and 44.4% for antiradical activity against 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 39.2% and 27.2% for antiradical activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 50.2% and 23.4% for reducing power, respectively.", "The results showed that nitrogen fertilization is an important factor determining the in vitro bioaccessibility of Greek oregano compounds. Furthermore, the nutraceutical potential of herbs, in term of the bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, may be optimized during plant cultivation by applying an accurate nitrogen level. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3795-0566"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "S\u0119czyk", "ForeName": "\u0141ukasz", "Initials": "\u0141"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6331-1963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kr\u00f3l", "ForeName": "Beata", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3128-3926"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Ko\u0142odziej", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Origanum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Karamanos AJ and Sotiropoulou DEK, Field studies of nitrogen application on Greek oregano (Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum (link) Ietswaart) essential oil during two cultivation seasons.
