Fiber, however, remains an important component of the diet. Soluble dietary fiber, including pectic substances and hydrocolloids, is found naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and oat bran. Insoluble fiber, including cellulose and hemicellulose, is found in foods such as whole grains. Fiber supplementation has been used to enhance the fiber content of a variety of foods ranging from cereal-based products to meats, imitation cheeses and sauces. Products used to enhance fiber content of foods have traditionally come from cereals such as wheat, corn and oats. There are a variety of other products, however, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and less commonly used cereals such as barley, which are potential sources of dietary fiber supplements. This article reviews research on some of these underutilized sources of dietary fiber."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McKee", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Latner", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}], "NumberOfReferences": "71"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Diabetes Care. 1997 Apr;20(4):545-50", "ArticleIdList": ["9096978"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1997;50(2):127-40", "ArticleIdList": ["9201747"]}, {"Citation": "J Nutr. 1998 Apr;128(4):714-9", "ArticleIdList": ["9521633"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11086873", "10.1023/a:1008144310986"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
