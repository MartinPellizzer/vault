A control diet and a diet with an increased content of peas and beans (leguminous diet) were given consecutively for a 3-week period each on a metabolic ward. Seven of the patients started with the control diet and 8 with the leguminous diet. On an energy basis the diets comprised 20% protein and 33-34% fat, the ratio between polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids was 1.4. The analysed dietary fibre contents of the control and leguminous diets were 24 and 37 g/day per 6.7 MJ (1,600 kcal) respectively. The content of digestible carbohydrates was similar in the 2 diets. The mean body weight did not differ after the 2 dietary treatment periods. All patients showed improved glucose control during treatment irrespective of the type of diet given. The fasting blood glucose concentration on admission was 14.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM). This value had decreased to 9.9 +/- 0.8 during the last week of the control period and to 9.7 +/- 0.6 during the last week of the leguminous diet period. The mean postprandial glucose concentration at 3 pm was significantly lower during the leguminous diet period. The mean urine glucose excretion was significantly lower during the leguminous diet period. The fasting serum lipid concentrations decreased during treatment with each diet, but there were no significant differences between these values at the end of the 2 diet treatment periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geriatrics, Uppsala University, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Karlstr\u00f6m", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vessby", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asp", "ForeName": "N G", "Initials": "NG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boberg", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lithell", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berne", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Diabetes Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8502339", "ISSNLinking": "0265-5985"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Diabetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Unsaturated"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3665345"]}}]}
