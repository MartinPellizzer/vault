The planar structures and relative configurations of globosumin and globosumone were determined by high-resolution ESI-MS and NMR data, and the absolute configurations of these two metabolites were determined by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circular dichroism (CD) combined with time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)-based quantum-chemical calculations. Chaetoglobosin A displayed biological effects against the seedling growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) in a dose-dependent manner, and this compound also exhibited biological activity against two cancer cell lines, A549 and HepG2, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.34 and 38.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.44\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
