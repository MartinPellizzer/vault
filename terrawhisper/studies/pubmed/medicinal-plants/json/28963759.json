Compound 1 is a flavanol framework with one \u03b4-lactone unit, which is rather rare in nature. The structures of the new compounds were determined on the basis of extensive spectroscopic (IR, MS, 1D- and 2D-NMR) analyses, the absolute configuration of 1 was established by comparing experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism spectra. The structures of known compounds were fixed by comparison with literatures data. Compounds 2 and 4 showed modest inhibitory activities against BEL-7402 cell line, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 28.22 and 39.16 \u03bcmol/L, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Zunyi Medical College, 201 Dalian Road, Zunyi, 563000, P.
