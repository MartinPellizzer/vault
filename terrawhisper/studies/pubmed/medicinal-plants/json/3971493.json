The levels of the betel nut-specific nitrosamines, N-nitrosoguvacoline and N-nitrososoguvacine (the latter being detected for the first time in saliva), ranged from 0 to 7.1 and 0 to 30.4 ng/ml, respectively. High levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines were detected in the saliva of chewers of betel quid with tobacco and in that of chewers of tobacco, ranging from 1.6 to 59.7 (N'-nitrosonornicotine), 1.0 to 51.7 (N'-nitrosoanatabine) and 0 to 2.3 [4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone] ng/ml. Urinary concentrations of certain N-nitrosamino acids, including N-nitrosoproline, were determined as a possible index of exposure to nitroso compounds and their precursors in the study groups: no clear difference was observed. The betel nut-specific alkaloid, arecoline, was present at high levels in the saliva of betel quid chewers with or without tobacco. Nicotine and cotinine were also detected in saliva and urine of chewers of tobacco and of betel quid with tobacco. In order to assess whether N-nitroso compounds are formed in vivo in the oral cavity during chewing or in the stomach after swallowing the quids, the levels of N-nitroso compounds in betel quid extracts were determined before and after nitrosation at pH 7.4 and 2.1. The results indicate that N-nitroso compounds could easily be formed in vivo. The possible role of N-nitroso compounds in the causation of cancer of the upper alimentary tract in betel quid chewers is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohshima", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Friesen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Croisy", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhide", "ForeName": "S V", "Initials": "SV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bartsch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "N0I CP-55715", "Acronym": "CP", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrites"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiocyanates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6M3C89ZY6R", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K5161X06LL", "NameOfSubstance": "Cotinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O748SU14OM", "NameOfSubstance": "thiocyanate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Cotinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrites"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Saliva"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiocyanates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3971493", "10.1093/carcin/6.2.295"]}}]}
