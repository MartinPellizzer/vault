Almost 82 research articles and abstracts published, so far, were screened for evaluating antiviral efficiency of various plant samples and 23 different plants were found to be traditionally used against Newcastle disease (ND). ND is a most transmissible viral disease of avian species caused by virulent strain of Avula virus from the Paramyxoviridae family. The first epidemic of ND was perceived in Java, Indonesia and England in year 1926. ND causes great economic loses to the commercial poultry farmers around the world. Medicinal plants are traditionally used in the control of viral or other diseases and infections. Plants have been found useful in treating many microbial diseases in man and animals caused by bacteria and viruses. The ability to synthesize compounds retaining antiviral potential by secondary metabolism makes plants a vital source of pharmaceutical and therapeutic products, which can reduce chemotherapeutic load in birds. Current studies signify that the natural products posses a rich potential source of new antiviral compounds. Further ethnobotanical studies and laboratory investigations are established to identify species having potential to improve ND control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mahboob", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Andleeb", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ijaz", "ForeName": "M U", "Initials": "MU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Slovakia", "MedlineTA": "Acta Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370401", "ISSNLinking": "0001-723X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Newcastle disease virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29521098", "10.4149/av_2018_101"]}}]}
