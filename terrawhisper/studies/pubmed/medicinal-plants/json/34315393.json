In order to send maximum radiation to tumor cells while minimizing toxicity in normal cells, a high affinity of targeting vectors to cancer tissue is essential. Besides that, the stable and specific complex between chelating agent and \u03b1-emitters was found as a crucial parameter. The present review was planned to highlight recent achievements about TAT-based targeting vectors and chelating agents and provide further insight for future researches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, Department of Cardiology, Heshmat Hospital, School of Medicine, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farzipour", "ForeName": "Soghra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Clinical Development Research Unit of Farshchian Heart Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shaghaghi", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Loghman Hakim Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Albooyeh", "ForeName": "Hajar", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alvandi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8BR2SOL3L1", "NameOfSubstance": "Radium-223"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NIK1K0956U", "NameOfSubstance": "Actinium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W90AYD6R3Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Radium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Actinium"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alpha Particles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34315393", "10.2174/1871520621666210727120308", "ACAMC-EPUB-116872"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
