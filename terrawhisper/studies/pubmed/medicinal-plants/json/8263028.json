Viability of the cells was determined by the Trypan blue exclusion test and the colorimetric tetrazolium (MTT) assay, whereas metabolic disturbance was evaluated by measuring the pools of reduced (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and the acidic amino acids, Glu and Asp. Fast uptake of ajoene was accompanied by an immediate reduction of the GSH and increase in the GSSG levels. The extent of these changes, as well as the further development of the metabolite pools, depended on the ajoene dose per cell. At a sublethal ajoene dose the GSH and GSSG pools rose at the later stages to levels much higher than in the control experiment. Bleb formation at the cytoplasmic membrane was a further rapid phenomenon, although injuries detected by Trypan blue exclusion developed only at a later stage. The MTT assay, performed in a parallel experiment (48 h after ajoene addition), showed, however, that reduction of cell viability was established at the very beginning of ajoene exposure. Altogether, the action of ajoene strongly resembled oxidative stress (i.e., interference with SH homeostasis and its pleiotropic consequences to cell physiology and metabolism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "GBF (Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Biotechnologische Forschung), Braunschweig, Germany."}], "LastName": "Scharfenberg", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ryll", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wagner", "ForeName": "K G", "Initials": "KG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "99A0041VG8", "NameOfSubstance": "ajoene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "B-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8263028", "10.1002/jcp.1041580108"]}}]}
