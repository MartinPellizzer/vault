There have been concerns over the high levels of total arsenic in cattail plants, but the chemical species of arsenic in cattail have not been characterized. We describe here the determination of arsenic species in the various compartments of cattail. Average concentrations of total arsenic from 9 to 19 cattail plants were 1120 microg/kg (range 68-2600 microg/kg) in the fine (hairy) roots, 575 microg/kg (range 16-1400) in the skin of tuber, 26 microg/kg (range 2-82) in the core of the tuber, 6 microg/kg (range 5-12) in the stem, and 420 microg/kg (range 4-1970) in the whole tuber. Speciation analysis using strong anion exchange, ion pairing, and strong cation exchange chromatography separation with MS detection revealed the presence of inorganic arsenite, arsenate, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid. The two inorganic arsenic species accounted for >80% of the total arsenic. Further analyses of arsenic and iron concentrations showed a strong correlation between arsenic and iron in the fine roots and skin. These results suggest that arsenic and iron are colocalized (codeposited) in the skin of the cattail plants, consistent with the previous findings. The level of exposure to arsenic from the use of cattail as food and medicine can be substantially reduced by removing the skin of cattail."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Analytical and Environmental Toxicology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Xiufen", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nguyen", "ForeName": "Nena", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gabos", "ForeName": "Stephan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Le", "ForeName": "X Chris", "Initials": "XC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Mol Nutr Food Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101231818", "ISSNLinking": "1613-4125"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oryza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Typhaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19382145", "10.1002/mnfr.200800296"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
