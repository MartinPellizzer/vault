The human being may also be affected by the exposed cattle from the affected area by consuming milk, egg, meat and others. In Ayurveda, several herbs like Haridra (turmeric), Shunthi (dried ginger root) and others are used for the management of arsenic poisoning.", "The study was conducted to find out the ameliorative effect of turmeric and ginger powder against experimentally induced arsenic toxicity in calves.", "Twenty four calves were divided into four groups (group I, II, III and IV) having six animals in each group. Animals of group I, II and III were orally administered with sodium arsenite at 1mg/kg body weight for 90 days and in addition group II and group III animals were treated orally with turmeric and ginger powder respectively at 10mg/kg body weight from 46th day onwards. Group IV animals were given food and water without drug and served as control. Arsenic content was estimated in faeces, hair, urine and plasma in every 15 days. Bio-chemical, haematological and anti-oxidant parameters were also assessed.", "Turmeric and ginger powder significantly (P<0.05) reduced the plasma and hair arsenic levels through increased excretion via faeces and urine. Haemoglobin level, TEC and TLC were decreased in groups I, II and III, however these were improved significantly (P<0.05) from 75th day onwards in turmeric and ginger treated groups. Increased activity of AST and ALT were significantly decreased (P<0.05) from 75th day onwards in group II and III. Blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine were also significantly decreased (P<0.05) in group II and III than group I from 60th day onwards. The SOD and catalase activity were significantly (P<0.05) reduced in groups I, II and III, but these were restored at the end of the experiment in turmeric and ginger treated groups.", "The test drugs are found significantly effective not only to eliminate arsenic from the body but also give protection from possible damage caused by arsenic exposure, it may be concluded from the present study that turmeric and ginger can be helpful in the therapy of chronic arsenic toxicity in calves."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
