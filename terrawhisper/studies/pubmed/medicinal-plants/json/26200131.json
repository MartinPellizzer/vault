Thirty-eight dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins were isolated from the steam-processed roots of P. notoginseng, including 18 new substances, namely, notoginsenosides SP1-SP18 (1-18). The structures of 1-18 were determined on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and acidic hydrolysis. The absolute configuration of the hydroxy group at C-24 in 1-4, 19, and 20 was determined in each case by Mo2(AcO)4-induced circular dichroism. The new compounds were found to feature a diversity of highly oxygenated side chains, formed by hydrolysis of the C-20 sugar moiety followed by dehydration, dehydrogenation, epoxidation, hydroxylation, or methoxylation of the main saponins in the raw roots. The new saponins 1, 2, 6-8, 14, and 17 and the known compounds 20-27 showed promoting effects on the differentiation of PC12 cells, at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
