Colon cancer is the second most common cancer in women and the fourth most common cancer worldwide. Investigating methods to reduce or prevent cancer through natural and holistic processes are becoming more of a common research topic around the world. Influenced through traditional Chinese medical practices and Ayurvedic medicine, scientists are now exploring anticancerous compounds present in plants and foods used in these cultures. For instance, ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been used for centuries all over Asia for medicinal purposes and contains anticancer compounds. Our review focuses on one of ginger's constituents, 6-shogaol, and its role in colon cancer. We found that 6-shogaol has a significant effect on apoptosis by influencing caspase pathways and cell cycle arrest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Hafuth", "ForeName": "Sowsan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada."}], "LastName": "Randhawa", "ForeName": "Sukhpal", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Oncog", "NlmUniqueID": "8914610", "ISSNLinking": "0893-9675"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "83DNB5FIRF", "NameOfSubstance": "shogaol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37183935", "10.1615/CritRevOncog.2022045100", "0285c63453fd8ef5,5ed801ca5fe505c6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
