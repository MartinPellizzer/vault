The chemical structures of all isolated compounds were identified on the basis of their physicochemical properties, spectroscopic analyses, as well as the comparisons of their physicochemical and spectroscopic data with the reported data in literature. As a result, 22 isolated compounds from the 90% ethanol extract of the fruits of M. citrifolia were identified, which were moricitritone(1), 2'-deoxythymidine(2), cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Tyr)(3), methyl-5-hydroxy-2-pyridinecarboxylate(4), methyl pyroglutamate(5), bisbenzopyran(6), epipinoresinol(7), 3, 3'-bisdemethyl pinoresinol(8), 3, 3'-bisdemethyltanegool(9), trimesic acid(10), crypticin B(11), kojic acid(12), vanillic acid(13), protocatechoic acid(14), 5-hydroxymethyl furfural(15), blumenol A(16), 1-O-(9Z, 12Z-octadecadienoyl) glycerol(17), mucic acid dimethylester(18), methyl 2-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosylbenzoate(19), 2-phenylethyl-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside(20), scopoletin(21), and quercetin(22). Among them, compound 1 was a new pyrone derivative, compounds 2, 4-7, 10-12, and 17 were isolated from the plants belonging to Morinda genus for the first time, and compound 18 was obtained from M. citrifolia for the first time. Moreover, on the basis of testing the activities of all isolated compounds on inhibiting the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts in vitro by MTS assay, the anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities of all isolated compounds were initially evaluated. The results showed that compounds 1-6, 9, 19, and 20 exhibited remarkable anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, which displayed the inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MH7A synovial fibroblast cells with the IC_(50) values in the range of(3.69\u00b10.08) to(168.96\u00b10.98) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Zhang-Yang", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Ruo-Qing", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Meng-Ran", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Suo", "ForeName": "Xin-Yuan", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Shu-Hong", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Key Laboratory of Research and Development of Tropical Fruits and Vegetables of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China Key Laboratory of Research and Development of Tropical Fruits and Vegetables of Haikou City,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571127,China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36725263", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220421.203"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
