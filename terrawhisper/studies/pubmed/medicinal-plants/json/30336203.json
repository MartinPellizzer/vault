Acute toxicity assay in mice through the oral administration of CIN-SMEDDS showed that the median lethal dose of CIN-SMEDDS was 2998.9\u202fmg/kg. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated that the cytotoxicity of CIN-SMEDDS to Caco-2 cells may be ascribed to the surfactant/co-surfactant mixture. In particular, CIN-SMEDDS remarkably inhibited inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 with a simultaneous increase in IL-10 in LPS-treated mice. Haematoxylin-eosin staining results showed that CIN-SMEDDS attenuated LPS-induced vascular endothelial injury. Western blot results showed that the vascular protective effects of CIN-SMEDDS were associated with the NF-\u03baB and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 signalling pathways. These findings indicated that CIN-SMEDDS can attenuate LPS-induced endothelial injury and thus was proposed as a promising agent for the treatment of inflammatory cardiovascular disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
