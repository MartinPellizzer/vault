(Huanglian) has been widely used in Asian traditional medicine. It was already known that Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome has various pharmacological properties including its anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory activity.", "To evaluate the immune-enhancement effect of the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract on helper T cells and its signaling mechanism.", "MOLT-4 human T cell line was used to investigate the effect of the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay and cytokine expression level was analyzed by ELISA and qRTPCR. MAPKs signal molecule's activation level was detected by immunoblotting.", "The expression of IFN-\u03b3, a cytokine of type I helper T (Th1) cell, increased; however, IL-4 was not affected by the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract. Other Th1 cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6, also increased. These data suggest that the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract activates MOLT-4 cell to Th1 cell, not type II helper T cell. Furthermore, the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract activates the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) signaling pathways.", "The results obtained from this study suggest that the Coptis chinensis Franch. rhizome extract should be used as an immune enhancer in anti-inflammatory medicine, adjuvant materials, and as a supplement to treat weakened immune system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016.
