This study aims to describe methods for synthesizing evidence for the effectiveness and safety of herbal medicine for treating PHN.", "Randomized controlled trials using herbal medicine in patients with PHN will be included in this review. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, KoreaMed, Research Information Service System, Korean Studies Information Service System, Database Periodical Information Academic, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, and Korea Citation Index will be searched without language limitations from their inception to September 2022. Two authors will perform quality assessments independently using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The primary outcome will be pain intensity, and the secondary outcomes will be global impression, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, QoL, and safety.
