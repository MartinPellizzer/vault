Sometimes these are the only source of health care available to poor people particularly in South East Asia where more than 80% population depend on herbal drugs for their health care needs. Thus the quality and safety of herbal products is very important in order to have desired therapeutic efficacy. But in today's polluted environment with increasing automobile consumption and industrialization, WHO is emphasizing emphatically that without heavy metal assessment the herbal drug should not be used. The concentration of heavy metals including Cr is increasing in the environment and many hazardous effects are caused in the inhabitants of that environment (Prasad and Hagemeyer, 1999; Nriagu and Pacyna, 1998). For example, in human beings, due to Cr numbers of disorders occur like damage to liver, kidney, respiratory and nerve tissues. Besides enhancing risk of human lung cancer due to automobile exhaust and even irritation of skin have also been reported by excess of Cr (Anonymous, 1998; Anonymous 1988). Therefore it is mandatory to assess the Cr concentration in herbal drugs before use. Although some work has been carried out by Rai et al., 2001 a, b; Fuh et al., 2003; Al Ajasa et al., 2004 and Ernst 2002 but it is not enough and lot of work is required in this field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy and Ethnopharmacology Division, National Botanical Research Institute, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226 001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agnihotri", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khatoon", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rawat", "ForeName": "A K S", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehrotra", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Environ Contam Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "0046021", "ISSNLinking": "0007-4861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0R0008Q3JB", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chromium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15903179", "10.1007/s00128-005-0608-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
