The NDF disappearance and VFA production also were measured. There were no significant differences between the VFA patterns from whole forage and NDF. There was a good linear correlation between the volume of gas produced and the mass of fiber digested in the NDF samples. Analysis of the gas curves with a dual-pool logistic model gave a lag value, digestion rates and pool sizes for the whole forage, the fiber component, and the NDS fraction. Rates for the NDS fraction ranged from .152 h-1 for clover to .191 h-1 for timothy. These rates are appreciably lower than values assumed in some models. Application of a triple-pool logistic model revealed the presence of faster-digesting material in the legumes. We discuss several different ways to measure the NDS pool size. The simplest method requires only a single gas measurement at the end of in vitro digestion of the whole forage coupled with an NDF disappearance measurement. The curve subtraction technique can provide information on the size and digestion kinetics of the NDS pool. This information is useful both for model studies and for agronomic research and may help us to understand the nutritional significance of this fast-digesting carbohydrate fraction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."}], "LastName": "Schofield", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pell", "ForeName": "A N", "Initials": "AN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Detergents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OP0UW79H66", "NameOfSubstance": "Methane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Detergents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8586606", "10.2527/1995.73113455x"]}}]}
