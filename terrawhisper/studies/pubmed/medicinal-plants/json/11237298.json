Two mycorrhizal inocula infected roots from the field and from clover trap cultures, were compared. Mycorrhizal infection (ranging from 33% to 46% of total root length) and Zn application had little effect on plant growth. Increasing Zn application rate led to increased uptake of Zn in roots and shoots (especially roots), but the increases were significantly greater in non-mycorrhizal controls than in mycorrhizal treatments. In contrast, P uptake was higher in mycorrhizal than in non-mycorrhizal plants. Plants that received trap culture inoculum had significantly lower Zn uptake than those that received field inoculum. The results indicate that mycorrhizal infection may have exerted some protective effect against plant Zn accumulation at the range of soil Zn concentrations studied and may have immobilised Zn in or near the roots to some extent. However, this mycorrhizal effect cannot be explained simply by tissue dilution, hyphal sequestration or root immobilisation of Zn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Science, The Queen's University of Belfast, UK. yongguan.zhu@adelaide.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Christie", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laidlaw", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chemosphere", "NlmUniqueID": "0320657", "ISSNLinking": "0045-6535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11237298", "10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00125-9", "S0045653500001259"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
