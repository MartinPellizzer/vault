Drugs used in MetS target different symptoms, like excessive body weight, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) regulate the gene expression involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and adipogenesis. Activation of PPAR\u03b3 has become a target of interest to counter hyperglycemia linked with MetS and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).", "The current review intended to summarize reported research on medicinal plants, or their bioactive constituents, with PPAR\u03b3-activating potential.", "The research team searched the literature up to 2016 using electronic databases- ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google-Scholar, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Wiley-for publications on medicinal plants with promising PPAR\u03b3 modulators using keywords diabetes mellitus, natural products, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, metabolic syndrome, adipogenesis.", "This study was conducted in the Department of Natural Products and Alternative Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, and Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, Taibah University, Al Madinah, Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia.", "Several natural products were considered to be good ligands for PPAR\u03b3. The PPAR\u03b3 agonistic activity of over 100 plants covered in this review was supported by experimental evidence. Some of the plants and their constituents had been studied for their possible mechanisms of action.", "Findings discussed in this review highlighted PPAR\u03b3's role as an organizer of lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, thus supporting its function as a target for antidiabetic agents. The discovery that some natural compounds and plants could activate PPAR\u03b3 opens up the prospect for future development of strategies to take advantage of its therapeutic potential in diabetes. Therefore, the current review could provide significant information for biotechnological or pharmaceutical applications in targeted drug delivery and design."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "Hossam M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El Dine", "ForeName": "Riham Salah", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Gamal A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Sabrin R M", "Initials": "SRM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shehata", "ForeName": "Ibrahim A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Halawany", "ForeName": "Ali M", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PPAR gamma"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "PPAR gamma"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31221946", "AT5853"]}}]}
