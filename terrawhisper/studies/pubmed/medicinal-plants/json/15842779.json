The concentration of endotoxin (ET) pretreated with OABA was quantitatively detected using Limulus test. The inhibition of ET-induced fever by OABA was measured in rabbits. The rates of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced death in mice pretreated with or without OABA were then compared. The influence of OABA on the release of TNF-alpha and NO from macrophages induced by LPS was examined in mice.", "After pretreatment with OABA, 84.4% of ET was destroyed. The ET-induced fever in rabbits decreased significantly and the rate of LPS-induced death in mice dropped from 70% to 20%. The release of TNF-alpha and NO induced by LPS in mice was inhibited dose-dependently when the concentration of OABA was between 0.125% and 0.5%.", "OABA isolated from BLG has an anti-endotoxic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China. fjg3560@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yun-hai", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-qing", "Initials": "WQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Shu-xian", "Initials": "SX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Hong-gang", "Initials": "HG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ortho-Aminobenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Fever"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Isatis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "ortho-Aminobenzoates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15842779", "10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00080.x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
