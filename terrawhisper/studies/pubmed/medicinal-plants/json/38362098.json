Geraniol (GNL) has high antioxidant effect that can induces liver regeneration. However, the protective effect of GNL effect on CCL<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatorenal toxicity in pregnant mice has not yet been studied.", "To investigate whether GNL could protect against oxidative stress induced by CCL<sub>4</sub> via the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT), and has been found to have protective effects on renal and hepatic tissues.", "Forty-eight female albino mice weighing 25-30 g were randomly allocated to 4 groups: Group I served as a control; Group II received a toxicity-inducing single dose of 15 \u03bcL of CCL<sub>4</sub> on the 4<sup>th</sup> day after mating; Group III received 40 mg/kg GNL + CCL<sub>4</sub> (with GNL from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of assimilation to delivery); and Group IV received GNL alone from the 1<sup>st</sup> day of assimilation to the end of the delivery period. GNL was evaluated for its protective effects on hepatotoxicity in CCL<sub>4</sub>-treated pregnant mice. Litter size, weight, survival rate, and resorption were recorded. In addition, H & E staining was done for liver and kidney pathology as well as biochemical markers and oxidative markers malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were analyzed.", "CCL<sub>4</sub> significantly reduced survival rate and increased resorption after exposure. Alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations in the serum, tissue MDA, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine were increased after CCL<sub>4</sub> exposure. GNL improved enzyme and antioxidant levels and prevented CCL<sub>4</sub>-induced hepatic injury in mice. Caspase-3 cleavage was decreased by GNL, which increased PI3K, phosphorylated AKT, Nrf2, and B-cell lymphoma 2.", "GNL demonstrates a protective effect against CCl4-induced hepatorenal toxicity, mediated through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the upregulation of Nrf2. These findings highlight the potential therapeutic implications of GNL in mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in liver and kidney tissues."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2024 Saudi Journal of Medicine & Medical Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Alzahrani", "ForeName": "Sabah Ali", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Alexandria University Egypt, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Bekhet", "ForeName": "Gamal M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Center of Biotechnology of Borj Cedria, Hammam-Lif, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ammar", "ForeName": "Rebai Ben", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Abdallah", "ForeName": "Basem M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Enas Mohamed", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, College of Veterinary Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Ramadan", "ForeName": "Saeed Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Althumairy", "ForeName": "Duaa", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Centre of Molecular Medicine and Diagnostics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Rajendran", "ForeName": "Peramaiyan", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Saudi J Med Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101675905", "ISSNLinking": "2321-4856"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mochizuki M, Shimizu S, Urasoko Y, Umeshita K, Kamata T, Kitazawa T, et al.
