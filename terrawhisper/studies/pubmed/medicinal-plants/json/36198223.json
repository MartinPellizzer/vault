Therefore, use of HMs needs to be assessed in patients with ALS.", "This study aimed to evaluate the benefits of HMs in ALS and to describe the characteristics of HM users.", "The correlation between HMs and prognosis was determined based on data obtained from the largest ALS database with high-quality clinical trials. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to address confounding and selection bias.", "In total, 321 and 231 HM users with at least a 4-week HM prescription were identified and PS-matched with non-HM users at a 1:1 ratio based on predefined confounders. Time-to-event models with censoring at 12 or 18 months were established for survival analyses. For evaluating activity limitation and respiratory function, 320 and 376 HM users were included, respectively, and analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).", "The profiles of 321 HM users indicated a better condition compared with that of non-HM users before PS-matching, including higher weight (median [IQR], 77.90 [21.8] kg vs. 74.00 [21.2] kg, p < 0.01), higher body mass index (26.00 [5.4] vs. 25.20 [5.8], p < 0.01), more percentage of limb onset (261 [81.3%] vs. 2366 [67.2%], p < 0.01), and slower progression (0.47 [0.5] vs. 0.51 [0.5], p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

After imputation of missing data, MANOVA revealed significant effectiveness of HMs in improving activity limitation (Pillai trace, 0.0195; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).", "PS-based methods eliminated baseline differences between HM and non-HM users.
