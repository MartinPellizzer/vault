In this study, we aimed to systematically review the literature wherein therapeutic effects of medicinal plants have been studied on VaD. A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other databases using VaD, and medicinal plants as key terms. No strict inclusion criteria were defined, and almost all clinical studies were included. A total of 524 articles were found, of which only 28 relevant articles with 3461 studied patients were included to this systematic review. The results showed that medicinal plants, particularly Sancaijiangtang and Ginkgo biloba could improve behavioral and psychological symptoms, working memory, Mini-Mental State Examination, and activities of daily living as well as neuropsychiatric features. It was also shown that the age, average progression of the disease, and the type of folk medicines effective in treating the disease are important factors in the management of VaD. The results of this review indicated that herbal therapy can be a potential candidate in the treatment of VaD; however, further studies are needed to confirm such efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4374-4619"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Toxicology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorani-Azam", "ForeName": "Adel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sepahi", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodaverdi", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7907-9625"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohajeri", "ForeName": "Seyed Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19FUJ2C58T", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginkgo biloba extract"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Activities of Daily Living"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dementia, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neuropsychological Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29786916", "10.1002/ptr.6120"]}}]}
