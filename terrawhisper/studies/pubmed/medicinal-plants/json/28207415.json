Western herbal medicine (WHM) is a system of complementary healthcare rooted in tradition. How WHM practitioners perceive, are prepared for, and use EBP, has to date been largely ignored. We therefore examined the use, opinion, skills, and training in EBP, and barriers and facilitators of EBP uptake, among herbal practitioners in the United States (US). Methods The study utilized a cross-sectional, descriptive survey design. A sample of US clinical herbalists was invited to complete a validated online questionnaire, the Evidence-Based practice Attitude and utilization SurvEy (EBASE). Results Seventy-four US herbal practitioners completed the survey (response rate=35\u2006%). Participants demonstrated a generally positive attitude toward EBP (median attitude subscore 31 [possible range=8-40]), a moderate to high level of self-assessed skill in EBP (median skill subscore 46 [13-65]) and a moderate level of EBP uptake (median use subscore 12 [0-24]). Apart from a lack of clinical evidence in herbal medicine, there were few perceived barriers to EBP uptake among herbal practitioners. Access to the Internet, online databases and full-text journal articles were considered most useful in facilitating the uptake of EBP in WHM practice. Conclusions Respondents' attitudes, skill level, and uptake of EBP were generally consistent with other complementary and alternative medicine providers. Educational initiatives, including those focused on the appraisal and application of evidence, may help to optimize the use of EBP among WHM practitioners."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Snow", "ForeName": "James E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leach", "ForeName": "Matthew J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Clare", "ForeName": "Bevin A", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Competence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Evidence-Based Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Seeking Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28207415", "10.1515/jcim-2015-0101", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2015-0101/jcim-2015-0101.xml"]}}]}
