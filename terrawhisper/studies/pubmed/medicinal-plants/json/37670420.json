However, the rootlets and aerial parts are discarded after collection of the roots, and the non-toxic polysaccharides in this plant have attracted less attention than the alkaloids and poisonous features. In this study, five neutral and 14 acidic polysaccharide fractions were isolated systematically from different plant parts of A. carmichaelii, and their structural features and bioactivity were studied and compared.", "The neutral fraction isolated from the rootlets differed from those isolated from the lateral and mother roots. It\u00a0consisted of less starch and more possible mannans, galactans, and/or xyloglucans, being similar to those of the aerial parts. Pectic polysaccharides containing homogalacturonan and branched type-I rhamnogalacturonan (RG-I) were present in all plant parts of A. carmichaelii. However, more arabinogalactan (AG)-II side chains in the RG-I backbone were present in the aerial parts of the plants, while more amounts of arabinans were found in the roots. Various immunomodulatory effects were observed, determined by complement fixation activity and anti-inflammatory effects on the intestinal epithelial cells of all polysaccharide fractions.", "This study highlighted the diversity of polysaccharides present in A. carmichaelii, especially in the unutilized plant parts, and showed their potential medicinal value. \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
