Nrf2 regulates the expression of many detoxification enzymes, making it an ideal target for cancer prevention. The present research revealed Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides extracts as promising sources of cancer chemopreventive compounds. Bioassay-guided isolation of the Z. Zanthoxyloides methanol extract resulted in the isolation of N-methylatanine, N-methylplatydesminecation, sesamin and skimmianine. Among these compounds, skimmianine was identified as the most active compound, causing a 2.8-fold increase in luciferase activity. Skimmianine and other related quinolone alkaloids could represent an appropriate starting scaffold for the development of new chemopreventive cancer drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
