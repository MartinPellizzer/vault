The poultry house indoor environment was selected for this study due to the relevant health problems in animals and their caretakers. Air quality parameters including temperature, relative humidity, airflow rate, NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and total suspended particles, as well as mean levels of total airborne bacteria and fungi count, were measured. Carbon isotope ratios (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) were obtained in size-segregated aerosol particles. The carbon (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) and nitrogen (<sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N) isotope ratios were measured in feed, litter, scrapings from the ventilation system, feathers and eggs. Additionally, the distribution of \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C and \u03b4<sup>15</sup>N values in different tissues of the chicken was examined. The airborne bacteria and fungi extracted from the air filters collected from poultry farms were grown in the laboratory in media with known isotope values and measured for stable isotope ratios. Analysis of isotope fractionation between microorganisms and their media indicated the applicability of stable isotope analysis in bulk samples for the identification of source material. The analysed examples imply that stable isotope analysis can be used to examine the indoor environment along with its biology and ecology, and serve as an informative bioanalytical tool."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Physics, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology , Vilnius , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Skipityt\u0117", "ForeName": "Raminta", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Physics, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology , Vilnius , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Ma\u0161alait\u0117", "ForeName": "Agn\u0117", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Physics, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology , Vilnius , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Garbaras", "ForeName": "Andrius", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences , Centre of Environmental Research, Vytautas Magnus University , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Mickien\u0117", "ForeName": "R\u016bta", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Sector of Medicinal Plants , Kaunas Botanical Garden of Vytautas Magnus University , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Raga\u017einskien\u0117", "ForeName": "Ona", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Food Safety and Quality, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Academy , Lithuanian University of Health Sciences , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Baliukonien\u0117", "ForeName": "Violeta", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Food Safety and Quality, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Academy , Lithuanian University of Health Sciences , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Bakutis", "ForeName": "Bronius", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Academy , Lithuanian University of Health Sciences , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "\u0160iug\u017edait\u0117", "ForeName": "J\u016brat\u0117", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Academy , Lithuanian University of Health Sciences , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Petkevi\u010dius", "ForeName": "Saulius", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences , Centre of Environmental Research, Vytautas Magnus University , Kaunas , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Maru\u0161ka", "ForeName": "Audrius Sigitas", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Institute of Physics, Center for Physical Sciences and Technology , Vilnius , Lithuania."}], "LastName": "Remeikis", "ForeName": "Vidmantas", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Isotopes Environ Health Stud", "NlmUniqueID": "9602611", "ISSNLinking": "1025-6016"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feathers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Floors and Floorcoverings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Housing, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27633837", "10.1080/10256016.2016.1230609"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
