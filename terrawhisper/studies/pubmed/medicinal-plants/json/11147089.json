Several of the senior members had a profound influence upon breeding theory: J.K. Nestler, Professor of Natural History and Agriculture at the University of Olomouc, left a collection of influential writings. In the context of sheep breeding he defined 'inheritance capacity' (Vererbungsf\u00e4higkeit), 'hereditary history' (Vererbungsgeschichte) and 'developmental history' (Entwicklungsgeschichte). His linking of the last two terms, as two sides of the same coin, puts Mendel's use of the second one in context. Professor F. Diebl taught the same topics as Nestler at the Philosophical Institute in Brno, with a bias towards plants. Diebl's lectures were attended by Mendel who gained top marks in three examinations. Diebl stressed the importance of artificial pollination to produce new varieties and recognised peas and beans as suitable subjects for the procedure. Prelate Cyrill Napp, abbot before Mendel, had a deep interest in heredity and how it was transmitted through both sexes. He generously supported Mendel's research. A happy blend of economic and academic influences, together with original talent and inner drive, led to Mendel's great discovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mendel Museum and Barvicova 51, 60200 Brno, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orel", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "C R Acad Sci III", "NlmUniqueID": "8503078", "ISSNLinking": "0764-4469"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Austria"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Genetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Mendel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"LastName": "Nestler", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11147089", "10.1016/s0764-4469(00)01266-x", "S076444690001266X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
