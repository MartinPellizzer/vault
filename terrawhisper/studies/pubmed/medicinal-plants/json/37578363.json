In April 2023, extensive root galls similar to those associated with by root-knot nematodes (RKNs), <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp., were observed on the roots of black nightshade in several commercial fields in Lufeng county (22\u00b055'57.44\u2033N, 115\u00b033'10.31\u2033E), Guangdong Province, China. Upon inspection, there were one to several female RKN in each gall, and egg masses protruding through the root surface. The disease incidence rate was more than 90% in each field using the random sampling method. The nematode population densities in the samples ranged from 279 to 656 eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2s) per gram of fresh roots. Females and egg masses were collected from the roots, and egg masses were incubated in sterile water at 25\u00b0C to obtain J2s. Males were not collected in root galling or soil samples. The J2 tail is thin with a broad, bluntly pointed tip, and a clearly defined hyaline tail terminus. Measurements of J2 (n = 20) included: L= 440 \u00b1 30.5 (384 to 500) \u00b5m, stylet = 12.3 \u00b1 0.7 (11.3 to 13.7) \u00b5m, tail = 51.6 \u00b1 2.4 (47.9 to 57.0) \u00b5m. For females (n = 15), vulval slit length = 25.5 \u00b11.9 (23.6 to 29.1) \u00b5m, vulval slit to anus distance = 22.1 \u00b1 3.0 (18.2 to 27.0) \u00b5m. Stylet knobs in females are divided longitudinally by a groove so that each knob appears as two. The perineal patterns are round to ovoid, with coarse and smooth striae, moderate to high dorsal arch and mostly lacking distinct lateral lines. Morphological characteristics from J2s and perineal patterns from adult females fit the original description of <i>M. enterolobii</i> (Yang and Eisenback 1983). Furthermore, species identity was explored by sequencing the D2-D3 region of the 28S rRNA gene using primers D2A/D3B (Vrain et al. 1992), and the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) genes using primers JB3/JB5 (Derycke et al. 2005). The sequences for the target genes were 759 bp (GenBank Accession No. OR046056) and 447 bp (GenBank Accession No. OR042802), respectively. The BLAST analysis suggested 98.17~99.78% similarities to other available <i>M. enterolobii</i> sequences in GenBank. Species identity was further confirmed with the species-specific primer pair Me-F/Me-R (Long et al. 2006). An approximately 240 bp PCR product was produced, which was previously reported only for <i>M. enterolobii</i>, whereas no product was obtained from control populations of <i>M. incognita</i> or <i>M. javanica</i>. The pathogenicity test was conducted in a greenhouse at 28\u00b0C using seedlings of <i>S. nigrum</i> maintained in pots containing 500 cm<sup>3</sup> sterilized soil. Ten replicates were inoculated with 800 eggs and J2s of the original population of <i>M. enterolobii</i>, while another 10 replicates of control plants were not inoculated. After 7 weeks, the inoculated plants exhibited galling symptoms similar to plants observed in the field, and females and egg masses were obtained by dissecting galls. No galling symptoms were observed on control plants. These results confirmed the nematode's pathogenicity. To our knowledge, this is the first record of <i>M. enterolobii</i> parasitizing black nightshade. <i>M. enterolobii</i> stands out as a highly deleterious variant among the species of RKNs owing to its extensive repertoire of host plants, pathogenicity, and proficiency in thriving and multiplying even on crops possessing resistance genes (Sikandar, 2022). In addition to being a medicinal plant, <i>S. nigrum</i> is a widespread weed found in fields throughout China. This report also showed that <i>S. nigrum</i> could play an important role as a reservoir host of <i>M. enterolobii</i> aiding its survival, reproduction, spread, and increasing the potential damage for host crops."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Sweet Potato, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; 983835131@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jingwei", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; 1502585197@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Fangyuan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; majukui@126.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jukui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; njnd831215@126.com."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Dongjing", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Plant Protection, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; zhchling5291@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "ChengLing", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, KunPeng Road, Xuzhou, China, 221131; tangv0001@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; xieyiping6216@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Yiping", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xuzhou Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Jiangsu Xuhuai Distric, 597009, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China; sunhouj1980@163.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Houjun", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37578363", "10.1094/PDIS-07-23-1316-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
