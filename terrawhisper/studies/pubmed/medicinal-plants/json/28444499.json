Hair trace element content in 33 women with IVF-induced pregnancy and 99 age- and body mass index-matched control pregnant women (natural pregnancy) was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results demonstrated that IVF-pregnant women are characterized by significantly lower hair levels of Cu, Fe, Si, Zn, Ca, Mg, and Ba at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or lower. Comparison of the individual levels with the national reference values demonstrated higher incidence of Fe and Cu deficiency in IVF-pregnant women in comparison to that of the controls. IVF pregnancy was also associated with higher hair As levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant interrelation between IVF pregnancy and hair Cu, Fe, Si, and As content. Hair Cu levels were also influenced by vitamin/mineral supplementation and the number of pregnancies, whereas hair Zn content was dependent on prepregnancy anthropometric parameters. In turn, planning of pregnancy had a significant impact on Mg levels in scalp hair. Generally, the obtained data demonstrate an elevated risk of copper, iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium deficiency and arsenic overload in women with IVF-induced pregnancy. The obtained data indicate the necessity of regular monitoring of micronutrient status in IVF-pregnant women in order to prevent potential deleterious effects of altered mineral homeostasis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Moscow, Russia. skalny3@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State University, Orenburg, Russia. skalny3@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia. skalny3@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RUDN University, Moscow, Russia. skalny3@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Skalny", "ForeName": "Anatoly V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State University, Orenburg, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yaroslavl State University, Yaroslavl, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RUDN University, Moscow, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Orenburg State Medical University, Orenburg, Russia."}], "LastName": "Tinkov", "ForeName": "Alexey A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychological Institute of Russian Academy of Education, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Voronina", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Terekhina", "ForeName": "Olga", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RUDN University, Moscow, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalnaya", "ForeName": "Margarita G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tomsk State University, Tomsk, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Goldsmiths, University of London, London, UK."}], "LastName": "Kovas", "ForeName": "Yulia", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "14-48-00043", "Agency": "Russian Science Foundation (RU)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Electrolytes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Electrolytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilization in Vitro"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28444499", "10.1007/s12011-017-1032-0", "10.1007/s12011-017-1032-0"]}}]}
