Liver fibrosis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by bile duct ligation and scission (BDL). After surgery, the hot-water extract of S. miltiorrhiza roots (100 mg kg(-1), p.o.) was administered daily for 28 days. The concentrations of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and total cholesterol in serum and hydroxyproline and malondialdehyde contents in liver were significantly increased in BDL rats. Treatment with the extract of S. miltiorrhiza significantly reduced (P < 0.01) the serum aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total cholesterol concentrations in BDL rats. The liver hydroxyproline content in BDL rats treated with extract was also reduced to 68% of that in BDL control rats (P < 0.01). The liver malondialdehyde content in BDL rats treated with the extract was also reduced to 47% of that in BDL control rats (P < 0.01). The morphological characteristics of fibrotic livers were improved in BDL rats treated with extract. Immunohistochemical examination of fibrotic liver showed that the extract of S. miltiorrhiza markedly reduced protein expression of alpha-smooth muscle cell-like actin, which indicates that hepatic stellate cell activation was inhibited during liver fibrosis development. The results indicate that the hot-water extract of S. miltiorrhiza roots inhibits fibrosis and lipid peroxidation in rats with liver fibrosis induced by biliary obstruction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Medicinal Resources Research Center, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Cheonbuk, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nan", "ForeName": "J X", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Cholestasis, Intrahepatic"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver Function Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11273016", "10.1211/0022357011775406"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
