Confidential identification and quantification of monoterpene indole alkaloids is the key to quality control of target plants in industrial production but has rarely been reported. In this study, quantitative performance of three data acquisition modes of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry including full scan, auto-MS<sup>2</sup> and target-MS<sup>2</sup> , was evaluated and compared for specificity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and matrix effect using five monoterpene indole alkaloids (scholaricine, 19-epi-scholaricine, vallesamine, picrinine, and picralinal). Method validations indicated that target-MS<sup>2</sup> mode showed predominant performance for simultaneous annotation and quantification of analytes, and was then applied to determine monoterpene indole alkaloids in Alstonia scholaris (leaves, barks) after extraction procedures optimization using Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology. The variations of A. scholaris monoterpene indole alkaloids in different plant parts, harvest periods, and post-handling processes, were subsequently investigated. The results indicated that target-MS<sup>2</sup> mode could improve the quantitative capability of ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry for structure-complex monoterpene indole alkaloids in herbal matrices.
