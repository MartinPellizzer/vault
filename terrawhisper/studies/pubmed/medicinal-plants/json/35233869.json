CM is usually used to relieve cough, while RM is usually used to treat pain. There are no studies on the quality control of RM and CM based on their analgesic and anti-inflammatory constituents associated with their traditional use. The chemical profiles of CM and RM were confusing. Some CM had similar profiles to RM, but some did not.", "We aimed to reveal the chemical differences between RM and CM and to evaluate their quality.", "Their chemical differences were studied using metabolomic analysis based on UHPLC-ESI-MS data. The contents of five quality marker candidates were determined by UHPLC-PDA. The analgesic activities of morusin and kuwanon C were assessed by an acetic acid-induced writhing test.", "CM was characterized by chemical diversity, whereas RM had good homogeneity. Four groups of CM were classified based on their chemicals. The chemical profiles of CM group 4 were more similar to that of RM. Eighteen putative features were identified based on an MS-Finder search and fragmentation rules. Content limits for four quality markers with anti-inflammatory or analgesic activities were proposed for RM. Furthermore, a possible biosynthetic relationship between kuwanon C, kuwanon G, and morusin was hypothesized based on the high Pearson coefficient between kuwanon G and morusin.", "The obtained results may be useful in the evaluation of RM and CM and afford insight into the biosynthetic pathway of Diels-Alder adducts in Morus."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Mengyin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yanan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Anqi", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qianru", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jianjun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0254-1383"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substance and Function of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Sujuan", "Initials": "S"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CIFMS 2021-I2M-1-028", "Agency": "CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "22177134", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2018Z070", "Agency": "Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Chan EWC, Lye PY, Wong SK.
