Non-ionic surfactants, viz. Triton X-100, Triton X-114 and Genapol X-80, were used for extraction. No back-extraction or liquid chromatographic steps were required to remove the target phytochemical from the surfactant-rich extractant phase. The optimized cloud point extraction procedure has been shown to be a potentially useful methodology for the preconcentration of the target analyte, with a preconcentration factor of 4-99. Moreover, the method is simple, sensitive, rapid and consumes lesser solvent than traditional methods. An isocratic chromatographic separation and quantitation was accomplished on a C(18) column with acetonitrile-acidified aqueous as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, UV detection at 254 nm and specificity with photo diode-array detector (PDA) and MS. Under the optimum experimental conditions recovery was satisfactory (99.18-100.33%) without interference from the surfactant. The method seems to be reliable with intraday precision and interday precision below 2.0%. Good linearity was obtained in the working range from 7.5 to 30 \u00b5g/mL with correlation coefficient >0.99. The limits of detection and quantitation were 1.84 and 6.13 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The method was validated following international guidelines and successfully applied for quantitative assays of cytotoxic compound phenyl-1,3,5-heptatriyne in Bidens pilosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Chemistry Department, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, PO-CIMAP, Lucknow, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trivedi", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Jonnala Kotesh", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Negi", "ForeName": "Arvind Singh", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shanker", "ForeName": "Karuna", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1-phenyl-1,3,5-heptatriyne"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkynes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Micelles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4300-27-0", "NameOfSubstance": "phenylheptatriyne"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-93-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Octoxynol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkynes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bidens"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Least-Squares Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micelles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Octoxynol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20812202", "10.1002/bmc.1505"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
