In this study, the three extractives from Cunninghamia lanceolata wood were removed by method of three-stage extraction with alcohol, petroleum ether, and alcohol/petroleum ether and their chemical components were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Thirteen chemical components were discovered in the first-stage extractives, including: 4-((1e)-3-hydroxy-1-propenyl)-2-methoxyphenol (36.80%), \u03b1-(2-phenylethenyl)-1-piperidineacetonitrile (15.39%). One-hundred chemical components were discovered in the second-stage extractives, including: [1s-(1\u03b1,4a\u03b1,10a\u03b2)]-1, 2,3,4,4a,9,10,10a-octahydro-1,4a- dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-1- phenanthrenecar-boxylic acid (15.16%), 1,3-dimethoxy-5-[(1e)-2- phenylethenyl]-benzene (6.99%). Seven chemical components were discovered in the third-stage extractives, including: 1,3-dimethoxy -5-[(1E)-2-phenylethenyl]-benzene (32.88%), stigmasta-4,6,22-trien-3\u03b1-ol (17.83%). And both the main retention time of the first-stage and which of third-stage extractives are 20-30 minutes, and the main retention time of the second-stage extractives is <10 minutes. Besides, the three extractives contained many biomedical molecular, such as [1s-(1\u03b1,4a\u03b1,10a\u03b2)]-1,2,3,4,4a,9,10,10a-octahydro-1,4a-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-1-phenanthrenecar-boxylic acid, squalene, stigmast-4-en-3-one and \u03b3-sitosterol and so on, which means that the three extractives from Cunninghamia lanceolata wood have huge potential in biomedicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China / Jiangmen Polytechnic, Jiangmen, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Beihua University, Jilin, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jun-You", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Feng", "Initials": "ZF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O3L624621X", "NameOfSubstance": "naphtha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cunninghamia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25796151"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
