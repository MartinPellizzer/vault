It has been reported to have a variety of biological activities such as antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigates the antiproliferative effect of <i>Ziziphus jujube</i> on KG-1 and NALM-6 acute leukemia cell lines. <b>Materials and Methods</b> <b>:</b> In this experimental study, the aqueous, ethyl acetate, and hydroalcoholic extracts of the <i>Ziziphus jujube</i> were prepared. Total phenolic and flavonoid components were detected because the presence of these compounds is associated with antioxidant and anticancer effects. Different concentrations of extracts were prepared, and KG-1 and NALM-6 cell lines were treated with them at 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Cell viability and IC<sub>50</sub> values of the extracts were calculated using MTT assays. BD Cycle TEST PLUS DNA Kit was used for cell cycle progression analysis. Bcl<sub>2</sub>, Bax, and caspase-3 mRNA expressions were also assessed. <b>Results</b> <b>:</b> Cell viability decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The best efficacy belonged to the ethyl acetate extract. Investigation of cell cycle progression demonstrated that the number of G0/G1 cells enhanced and the number of G2/M cells decreased when the ethyl acetate extract was applied in its IC<sub>50</sub> concentration. A considerable increase in <i>Caspase-3</i> and <i>Bax</i> and a decrease in <i>Bcl2</i> gene expression were detected in molecular examination. <b>Conclusion</b> <b>:</b> According to our research, <i>Ziziphus jujube</i> ethyl acetate extract has antitumor properties on KG-1 and NALM-6 cell lines, possibly through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle regulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Tehran University of Medical Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mosadegh Manshadi", "ForeName": "Shiva", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shams Ardekani", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101511150", "ISSNLinking": "2008-2207"}, "CoiStatement": "None declared."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "William B Ershler, Kenneth Kaushansky, Marshal A Litchtman, Josef T Prchal, Marcel M Levi, Oliver W Press, Linda J Burns, Michael A Caligiuri.
