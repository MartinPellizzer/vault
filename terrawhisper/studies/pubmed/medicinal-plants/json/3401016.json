This was made possible by the ability to elevate the enzyme level markedly through hormone treatments and by stabilization of the enzyme with high phosphate concentrations. The four-step procedure resulted in 1050-fold purification with 25% yield, and consisted of stepwise elution from hydroxylapatite, chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, gradient elution from hydroxylapatite, and fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a MonoQ anion-exchange column. FPLC-purified ACC synthase migrated as a single band of Mr 65,000 on denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of native enzyme by Bio-Gel A-0.5 M chromatography was 125,000, indicating that the enzyme probably exists as a dimer of identical 65,000 Mr subunits. The mung bean ACC synthase exhibited a pH optimum of 8.0 for activity and a Km for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) of 55 microM at 30 degrees C. It exhibited an Arrhenius activation energy of 12 kcal mol-1 degree-1 and was inactivated at temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C. The specific activity for pure ACC synthase was 21 mumol of ACC formed/mg protein/h when determined under optimal conditions with 400 microM AdoMet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arteca", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bachman", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14I68GI3OQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminooxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7LP2MPO46S", "NameOfSubstance": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.14", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylate synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JAC85A2161", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KXG6A989PS", "NameOfSubstance": "benzylaminopurine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P39Y9652YJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Kinetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aminooxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Purines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3401016", "10.1016/0003-9861(88)90329-3", "0003-9861(88)90329-3"]}}]}
