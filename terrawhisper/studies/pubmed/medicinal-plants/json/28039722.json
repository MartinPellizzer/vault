Nowadays, the use of natural products in cancer therapy has a great importance. In addition, working with plants that are endemic to Turkey and determining the biological activities of these plant extracts, is extremely important due to the potential for new drug development. There is no comparative study available in the literature on the antitumor effects of Colchicum sanguicolle, a new found species of the genus Colchicum in Turkey, Crateagus microphylla, of the genus Crateagus and Centaurea antiochia of the genus Centaurea. In this study, we tried to demonstrate the antitumor effect of these plant extracts on HeLa and C 4-1 cells.", "Five different doses (0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml) of the three plant types were prepared and applied for 24, 48 and 72 hrs on the cervical cancer derived cell lines. Subsequently, the growth rate was evaluated with the mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme method.", "Colchicum sanguicolle extracts showed the most effective antitumor activity. For the Colchicum sanguicolle extract, the IC50 dose for HeLa cells was 0.01 mg/ml at 48 hrs, while for the C-4 I cells it was 0.001 mg/ml at 48 hrs. These results showed that C-4 I cells were more sensitive to the Colchicum sanguicolle extracts. Conclus?on: The results of from this study regarding the antitumor effect of plant extracts of endemic varieties of Turkey may have an important place in design and development of anticancer drugs and would make contributions to other studies to be conducted in this area."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Istanbul University, Faculty of Science, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ozcan", "ForeName": "Gul", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dagdeviren Ozsoylemez", "ForeName": "Ozlem", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akman", "ForeName": "Gizem", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khalilia", "ForeName": "Walid", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tezel Yetiz", "ForeName": "Beliz", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Karagoz", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Melikoglu", "ForeName": "Gulay", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anil", "ForeName": "Sezin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kultur", "ForeName": "Sukran", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sutlupinar", "ForeName": "Nurhayat", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Cyprus", "MedlineTA": "J BUON", "NlmUniqueID": "100883428", "ISSNLinking": "1107-0625"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Shape"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Colchicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28039722"]}}]}
