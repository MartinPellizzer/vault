Kalopanax septemlobus contains approximately 15 triterpenoid saponins primarily constituted of hederagenin aglycones. Hederagenin is a representative precursor for hemolytic saponin in plants. In the present study, transcriptome analysis was performed to discover genes involved in hederagenin saponin biosynthesis in K. septemlobus. De novo assembly generated 82,698 unique sequences, including 17,747 contigs and 64,951 singletons, following 454 pyrosequencing. Oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs) are enzymes that catalyze the formation of diverse triterpene skeletons from 2,3-oxidosqualene. Heterologous expression of an OSC sequence in yeast revealed that KsBAS is a \u03b2-amyrin synthase gene. Cytochrome P450 genes (CYPs) make up a supergene family in the plant genome and play a key role in the biosynthesis of sapogenin aglycones. In total, 95 contigs and 110 singletons annotated as CYPs were obtained by sequencing the K. septemlobus transcriptome. By heterologous expression in yeast, we found that CYP716A94 was \u03b2-amyrin 28-oxidase involved in oleanolic acid production from \u03b2-amyrin, and CYP72A397 was oleanolic acid 23-hydroxylase involved in hederagenin production from oleanolic acid. Engineered yeast co-expressing KsBAS, CYP716A94 and CYP72A397 produced hederagenin. Kalopanax septemlobus CYP72A397 is a novel CYP enzyme that synthesizes hederagenin aglycone from oleanolic acid as a single product. In conclusion, we characterized three genes participating in sequential steps for hederagenin biosynthesis from \u03b2-amyrin, which are likely to play a major role in hederagenin saponin biosynthesis in K. septemlobus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Jung Yeon", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Chun", "ForeName": "Ju-Hyeon", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Oh", "ForeName": "Se Ah", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Seong-Bum", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Hwan-Su", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Forest Biotechnology, Korea Forest Research Institute, Suwon 441-847, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Hyoshin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forest Resources, College of Forest and Environmental Sciences, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Yong Eui", "Initials": "YE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6SMK8R7TGJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RQF57J8212", "NameOfSubstance": "hederagenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S5UOB36OCZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Mevalonic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biocatalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Kalopanax"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mevalonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oleanolic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29186583", "10.1093/pcp/pcx188", "4657113"]}}]}
