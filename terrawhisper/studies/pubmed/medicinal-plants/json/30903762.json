The structures of these compounds were elucidated based on 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and complemented by electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry results and by comparison to data of related compounds described in the literature and ab initio calculations. Rubescin F (1) is the first limonoid from Trichilia spp. with an oxetane ring between C-7 and C-14, which seems to be formed by the isomerization of TS1 (4). The \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide rubescin G (2) is a potential precursor of trichirubine A (5), whereas rubescin H (3) is the first example of a triterpenoid with a single bond between C-7/C-14, forming a cyclopropane ring. The absolute configuration of these limonoids was derived from biosynthetic considerations and ab initio calculations of NMR and optical rotation dispersion data."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5672-046X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen, Institute of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Tammannstra\u00dfe 2, D-37077 G\u00f6ttingen, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Yaound\u00e9 I, P.O.
