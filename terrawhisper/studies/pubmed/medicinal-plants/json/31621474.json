The twelve most popular herbal teas available in Poland and their infusions in filtered and tap water were analyzed as well as <sup>210</sup>Pb activity concentrations and effective doses (radiation) were calculated. The highest activity concentration of <sup>210</sup>Pb in dried plants was determined in cistus - 35.5\u2009Bq kg<sup>-1\u2009</sup>dry wt, while the lowest was in milk thistle - 3.25\u2009Bq kg<sup>-1\u2009</sup>dry wt what gives respectively for cistus 46.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7 and 6.50\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 mBq for milk thistle per one tea bag. The extraction efficiencies in the filtered water oscillated from 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.5 for milk thistle to 27.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8% for cistus, while for the tap water they ranged from 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6% for lime to 33.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2% for white mulberry. Based on the study, it was found that the analyzed herbal tea consumption would give a small portion of the annual effective dose of <sup>210</sup>Pb received in Poland - the annual effective radiation dose of <sup>210</sup>Pb taken with herbal tea infusions (one glass daily) was calculated from 0.08\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 to 3.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 \u00b5Sv."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Radiation Protection Laboratory, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Moniakowska", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3816-3572"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Radiation Protection Laboratory, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Olszewski", "ForeName": "Grzegorz", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Radiation Protection Laboratory, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Block", "ForeName": "Klaudia", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Radiation Protection Laboratory, Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gda\u0144sk, Gda\u0144sk, Poland."}], "LastName": "Strumi\u0144ska-Parulska", "ForeName": "Dagmara", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Teas, Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination, Radioactive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lead Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Teas, Herbal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31621474", "10.1080/10934529.2019.1678323"]}}]}
