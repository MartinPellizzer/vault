In this study, the symptom and physiological parameters of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected P. notoginseng were analyzed and the RNA-seq was performed. The results showed that CMV infection affected the photosynthesis of P. notoginseng, caused serious oxidative damage to P. notoginseng and increased the activity of several antioxidant enzymes. Results of transcriptome analysis and corresponding verification showed that CMV infection changed the expression of genes related to plant defense and promoted the synthesis of P. notoginseng saponins to a certain extent, which may be defensive ways of P. notoginseng against CMV infection. Furthermore, pretreatment plants with saponins reduced the accumulation of CMV. Thus, our results provide new insights into the role of saponins in P. notoginseng response to virus infection."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
