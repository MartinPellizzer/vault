Meyer, to cause differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells as a model system. F9 stem cells cultured in the presence of the ginsenosides together with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) became parietal endoderm-like cells. Moreover, the expression of differentiation marker genes, such as laminin B1 and type IV collagen, was increased after treatment with the ginsenosides. Among the various purified ginsenosides, Rh1 and Rh2 were the most effective at causing differentiation of F9 cells. Since ginsenosides and glucocorticoid hormone have similar chemical structures, we examined the possibility of the involvement of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the differentiation process induced by the ginsenosides. According to Southwestern blot analysis, a 94 kDa protein regarded as a GR was detected in F9 cells cultured in the medium containing the ginsenosides Rh1 or Rh2. In addition, F9 stem cells treated with the ginsenosides Rh1 or Rh2 and with RU486, a glucocorticoid antagonist with a high affinity for the GR, did not differentiate into endoderm cells morphologically, and the expression of laminin B1 gene was not induced in these cells. In a gel mobility shift assay, protein factors capable of binding to the glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) specifically were detected in nuclear extracts of the ginsenoside-treated F9 cells. Moreover, overexpression of GR by cotransfection of GR expression vector and GRE-luciferase vector enhanced the transactivation activity of GRE promoter in the presence of ginsenosides Rh1 or Rh2 and was further augmented by dbcAMP. In addition, ginsenosides Rh1 and Rh2 bound to a GR assessed by whole-cell binding assay, even though the specific binding affinity was weaker compared to dexamethasone. Based on these data, we suggest that the ginsenosides Rh1 and Rh2 cause the differentiation of F9 cells and the effects of ginsenosides might be exerted via binding with a GR or its analogous nuclear receptor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Pusan National University, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y N", "Initials": "YN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S I", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "9005373", "ISSNLinking": "0959-8049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Glucocorticoid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "320T6RNW1F", "NameOfSubstance": "Mifepristone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.12.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Luciferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Luciferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mifepristone"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplastic Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Glucocorticoid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Teratocarcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptional Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8869109", "10.1016/0959-8049(96)00102-5", "0959-8049(96)00102-5"]}}]}
