Many organs might suffer injuries from the intake of PAs, and the liver is the most susceptible one. The diagnosis, toxicological mechanism, and detoxification of PAs-induced hepatotoxicity have been studied for several decades, which is of great significance for its prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. When the liver was exposed to PAs, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) loss, hemorrhage, liver parenchymal cells death, nodular regeneration, Kupffer cells activation, and fibrogenesis occurred. These pathological changes classified the PAs-induced liver injury as acute, sub-acute, and chronic type. PAs metabolic activation, mitochondria injury, glutathione (GSH) depletion, inflammation, and LSECs damage-induced activation of the coagulation system were well recognized to play critical roles in the pathological process of PAs-induced hepatotoxicity. A lot of natural compounds like glycyrrhizic acid, (-)-epicatechin, quercetin, baicalein, chlorogenic acid, and so on were demonstrated to be effective in alleviating PAs-induced liver injury, which rendered them huge potential to be developed into therapeutic drugs for PAs poisoning in clinics. This review presents updated information about the diagnosis, toxicological mechanism, and detoxification studies on PAs-induced hepatotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8286-6814"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The MOE Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicines, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines and The SATCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Zhenlin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The MOE Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicines, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines and The SATCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zeqi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The MOE Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicines, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines and The SATCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Xinnan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6159-2626"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The MOE Key Laboratory for Standardization of Chinese Medicines, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines and The SATCM Key Laboratory for New Resources and Quality Evaluation of Chinese Medicines, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Lili", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8914275", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8444"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38411492", "10.1080/10408444.2024.2310597"]}}]}
