Their antigenic specificities were tested against subunits of two-chain and one-chain legume lectins separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters. Different binding to native and detergent-treated lectins in dot-blots indicated that two of the antibodies bound to conformational epitopes which by immunoblotting were shown to be expressed on the heavy subunits from all the five tested two-chain lectins and on the six one-chain lectins, including PHA (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Con A (Canavalia ensiformis). However, ELISA cross-inhibition studies showed that these two antibodies bound to different epitopes on the lectin molecules. The third MoAb reacted with a continuous epitope not revealed by classical taxonomy since only three of five heavy subunits of the two-chain lectins stained with the antibody. Comparison of the known amino-acid sequences of the chains indicates eight positions as possible binding sites for this antibody."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, National Institute of Public Health, Oslo."}], "LastName": "Kolberg", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michaelsen", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wedege", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Heier", "ForeName": "H E", "Initials": "HE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler", "NlmUniqueID": "8503054", "ISSNLinking": "0177-3593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigen-Antibody Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lathyrus lectin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigen-Antibody Complex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3166740", "10.1515/bchm3.1988.369.1.365"]}}]}
