When 136 to 145 metastatic colonies were produced in lungs of mice inoculated with 1 x 10(5) cells/mouse of melanoma cells, less than 15 metastatic colonies were demonstrated when these tumor-inoculated mice were treated orally with 80 to 320 mg/kg doses of Keishi-ka-kei-to. The most active component in the mixture was shown to be 6-gingerol, derived from the Zingiberis rhizoma extract. The antimetastatic activity of 6-gingerol was expressed through the host's antitumor immune functions, as the growth of B16F10 melanoma cells was not affected by this substance in vitro. The splenic CD8+ T cells from mice treated with the compound showed inhibitory activities on pulmonary metastasis when these T cells were adoptively transferred to mice bearing B16F10 melanoma cells. These results may suggest that Keishi-ka-kei-to inhibits pulmonary metastasis in mice bearing B16F10 melanoma cells through the stimulation of CD8+ T cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0835, USA."}], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pollard", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8102988", "ISSNLinking": "0250-7005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "secondary"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "secondary"], "DescriptorName": "Melanoma, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9137420"]}}]}
