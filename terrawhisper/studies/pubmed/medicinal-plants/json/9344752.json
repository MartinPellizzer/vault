The conformational states of the coat protein were analyzed by their intrinsic fluorescence, binding of bis(8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) (bis-ANS) and susceptibility to trypsin digestion. CPSMV could be disassembled by pressure at 2.5 kbar. Intrinsic fluorescence and hydrodynamic measurements showed that pressure-induced dissociation was completely reversible. Virus pressurization in the presence of ribonuclease revealed that viral RNA was not exposed, since it was not digested by the enzyme, suggesting the maintenance of protein-nucleic acid interactions under pressure. When the temperature was decreased to -10 degrees C under pressure, CPSMV disassembly became an irreversible process and in this condition, viral RNA was completely digested by ribonuclease. These results suggest a relationship between protein-RNA interactions and CPSMV assembly. Bis-ANS binding and trypsin digestion of coat proteins revealed that they assume a different conformation when they are denatured by low temperatures under pressure or than when they are denatured by urea at atmospheric pressure. The results indicate that the coat proteins can exist in at least four states: (1) The native conformation in the virus capsid; (2) bound to RNA when the virus is dissociated by pressure at room temperature, assuming a conformation that retains the information for reassembly; (3) free subunits in a molten-globule conformation when the virus is dissociated by low temperature under pressure; and (4) free subunits completely unfolded by high concentrations of urea."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1997 Academic Press Limited."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, 21941-590, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gaspar", "ForeName": "L P", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Da Poian", "ForeName": "A T", "Initials": "AT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63741-13-9", "NameOfSubstance": "5,5'-bis(8-(phenylamino)-1-naphthalenesulfonate)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Comovirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrostatic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Folding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "RNA-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9344752", "10.1006/jmbi.1997.1299", "S0022-2836(97)91299-7"]}}]}
