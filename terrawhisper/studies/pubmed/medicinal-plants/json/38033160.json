We have recently demonstrated that biocontrol bacteria induce a repulsive response in <i>M. incognita</i> via two classical signaling pathways. The present study aimed to identify the novel genes and signaling molecules of <i>M. incognita</i> that potentially contribute to its defense reaction. Analysis of the transcriptome data of <i>M. incognita</i> with and without a repulsive response against <i>Bacillus nematocida</i> B16 obtained 15 candidate genes, of which the novel genes <i>Minc3s01748g26034</i> and <i>Minc3s02548g30585</i> were found to regulate the aversive behavior of <i>M. incognita</i>, and their functions were further validated. To further confirm the neuronal localization of the two novel genes in <i>M. incognita</i>, in situ hybridization was conducted using the digoxin-labeled probes of ten tag genes, and preferentially profiled the localization of amphid sensory neurons of <i>M. incognita</i>. Analysis of the overviewed neuronal map suggested that <i>Minc3s01748g26034</i> and <i>Minc3s02548g30585</i> functioned in ASK/ASI and CEPD/V neurons, respectively. During their interactions, the volatile compounds 3-methyl-butyric acid and 2-methyl-butyric acid produced by the biocontrol bacteria were predicted as the primary signaling molecules that promoted the repulsive behavior of <i>M. incognita</i> against biocontrol bacteria. The findings provided novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the repulsive response of <i>M. incognita</i> that are different from the canonical molecular pathways previously found in <i>C. elegans</i> and can aid in developing novel strategies for controlling root-knot nematodes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, and State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming 650200, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanli", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, and State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Chidi", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, and State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yixin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, and State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Wenhui", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, and State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources, Yunnan University, Kunming 650091, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Xiaowei", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "107-92-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tylenchoidea"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caenorhabditis elegans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butyric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38033160", "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c06074"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
