Lignans are essential ingredients and are rich in Piper plants. Although many phytochemical studies have reported many lignans identified from Piper plants, comprehensive research has not reviewed these compounds. Hence, the present review reports on natural lignans from the genus Piper and their pharmacological activities. At least 275 lignans have been discovered from the Piper genus until October 2022, including traditional lignans, neolignans, oxyneolignans, norlignans, secolignans, and polyneolignans, especially some neolignans and norlignans with novel and complex scaffolds. In addition, these lignans have been reported to show various pharmacological activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidative, anti-platelet aggregation, cytotoxic, anti-parasitic, CYP3A4 inhibitory activities, and so on. The current work presents an up-to-date critical review and a systematic summary of publications on lignans from the genus Piper to lay the groundwork and show better insights for further investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
