A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview a total of 100 people. The results of the survey will be useful in creating the groundwork for future scientific research and validation. There were 15 veterinary medicinal plant species identified, which were divided into 10 families. The only types of growth that were utilized were trees, herbs, and bushes. Leaves (71%) were the most widely used plant parts for ethnoveterinary medicine (EVM), followed by bark (14%), stem (8%), and root (7%). Fresh components were frequently preferred in medical compositions. Oral administration was the most common (42.76%), followed by cutaneous (topical) administration (36.18%). Indigenous knowledge was largely passed down through the generations by word of mouth, indicating that it was vulnerable to fragmentation and loss. EVMs were crushed, soaked in water, and administered orally or topically. Farmers who were older had greater EVM knowledge than those who were younger. <i>Ziziphus mucronate, Combretum collinum</i>, and <i>Colophospermum mopane</i> were used in the treatment of diarrhea. <i>Z. mucronate</i> was also used in the treatment of mastitis. Skin infections were treated using <i>Aloe esculenta</i> and <i>Salvadora persica</i>. <i>Ximenia americana</i> and <i>C. imberbe</i> were used to treat eye infections in cattle, goats, and sheep. Retained placentas were treated using <i>Acacia nilotica, A. erioloba</i>, and <i>Grewia flavescens</i>. Roots from <i>Fockea angustifolia</i> were used in treating anthrax. <i>A. esculenta</i> Leach placed best with a fidelity level (FL) value of 90%, followed by <i>A. littoralis</i> Baker in second place (56%), and <i>Combretum collinum</i> Fresen in third place (54%). The majority of EVM recipes took 2-3 days to recover. More research is needed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations, biological activities, and toxicities, as well as characterize the chemical components of the plants and determine whether there is a plausible mechanism by which plant chemicals or possible physiological effects could achieve the results described by the respondents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Eiki, Maake, Lebelo, Sakong, Sebola and Mabelebele."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Eiki", "ForeName": "Ndahambelela", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Maake", "ForeName": "Matome", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life and Consumer Sciences, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Lebelo", "ForeName": "Sogolo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Sakong", "ForeName": "Bellonah", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Sebola", "ForeName": "Nthabiseng", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mabelebele", "ForeName": "Monnye", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Front Vet Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101666658", "ISSNLinking": "2297-1769"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Herrero M, Grace D, Njuki J, Johnson N, Enahoro D, Silvestri S, et al. .
