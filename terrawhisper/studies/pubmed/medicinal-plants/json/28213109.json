Furthermore, five plant extracts from Corydalis species inhibited the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase considerably, one plant extract inhibited the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase to some extent and 29 plant extract had no effect on the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase.", "An optimal extract in this study would possess acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity as well as anti-amyloidogenic activity in order to address multiple facets of Alzheimer's disease, until the molecular origin of the disease is unraveled.
