Adults of R. dominica were more susceptible than the other species to fumigant vapors of l-carvone, d-carvone, and dihydrocarvone. The three larval stages (14-, 16-, and 18-d-old) of T. castaneum progressively became more susceptible with age toward contact toxicity of three test compounds but in fumigant toxicity, 16-d-old larvae of T. castaneum were more susceptible to the three compounds. Comparison of contact and fumigant toxicity of the test compounds indicates that l-carvone and d-carvone possess 24 times more fumigant toxicity toward adults of R. dominica than its contact toxicity. Overall order of toxicity was l-carvone > d-carvone > dihydrocarvone. Egg hatching and subsequent larval and adult survival of T. castaneum were significantly reduced when the eggs of T. castaneum were treated with l-carvone, d-carvone, and dihydrocarvone. l-Carvone completely suppressed egg hatching at the concentration of 7.72 mg/cm2. Data on feeding-deterrent indices indicate the high potency of l-carvone as feeding-deterrent in order of S. oryzae adults > T. castaneum adults > R. dominica adults > T. castaneum larvae."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection Group, Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, P.O.
