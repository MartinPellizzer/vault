Polysomnography was conducted in 14 elderly poor sleepers on three nights, at one-week intervals (N0, N1, N2). N0 was an adaptation night, N1 and N2 the first and last night under treatment. Six subjects received placebo and eight subjects valerian. Subjects in the valerian group showed an increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS) and a decrease in sleep stage 1. Density of K-complexes was increased under active treatment. There was no effect on sleep onset time or time awake after sleep onset. REM sleep was unaltered. There was also no effect on self-rated sleep quality. We hypothesize that valerian increases SWS in subjects with low baseline values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "AFB-PAREXEL Arzneimittelforschung GmbH, Berlin."}], "LastName": "Schulz", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stolz", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacopsychiatry", "NlmUniqueID": "8402938", "ISSNLinking": "0176-3679"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Polysomnography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Stages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep Wake Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep, REM"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7972346", "10.1055/s-2007-1014295"]}}]}
