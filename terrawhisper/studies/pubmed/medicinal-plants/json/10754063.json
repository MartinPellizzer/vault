When the structure was determined in our laboratory, it was found to form a characteristic beta-trefoil fold, which is also seen in other proteins from distant families and sources. The folding organization divides the protein into three approximately equal subdomains related by a pseudo-threefold axis of symmetry passing parallel to the barrel axis of the trefoil. Following the now established idea that the present-day genes originated from ancestral minigenes through evolution, the origin of the proteins having this beta-trefoil organization is scrutinized using its subdomain motif as the search probe. The results, based mainly on structural analyses, indicate the independent existence of such a motif, mimicking the unknown ancestral protein(s) that might have been distributed in nature, not only by gene duplication, but also by insertion and permutation in other folds. The understanding led to a hypothesis for the possible origin of the Kunitz-STI family. On the basis of this model of evolution, structurally hypervariable regions were located on the protein where mutations could be designed and a broad range of engineering of the protein's activity could be conceived."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Crystallography and Molecular Biology Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, 1/AF Bidhan Nagar, Calcutta 700 064, India. deb@mb2.saha.ernet.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mukhopadhyay", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Evol", "NlmUniqueID": "0360051", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2844"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evolution, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10754063", "10.1007/s002399910024", "10.1007/s002399910024"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
