The formation of this peak was dependent on both the presence of Glc2Man9GlcNAc and the presence of glycerol, and the amount of this product increased with time of incubation and amount of glucosidase II in the incubation. When the incubation was performed with [3H]Glc2Man9GlcNAc plus [14C]glycerol, the product contained both 14C and 3H. Strong acid hydrolysis of the purified product gave rise to [14C]glycerol and [3H]glucose. Various other chemical treatments and chromatographic techniques showed that the product was glucosyl----glycerol. Since the glucose was released by alpha-glucosidase, the product must be glucosyl-alpha-glycerol. This study demonstrates that the processing glucosidase II catalyzes a trans-glycosylation reaction in the presence of acceptors like glycerol. Since this transglycosylation reaction may give rise to unexpected products, investigators should be aware of its possible occurrence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284."}], "LastName": "Kaushal", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pastuszak", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hatanaka", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elbein", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK 21800", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrophenyl-alpha-glucosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PDC6A3C0OX", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2665651", "10.1016/0003-9861(89)90243-9", "0003-9861(89)90243-9"]}}]}
