Leaching of Al from cookware while preparing tea and coffee was also studied. Experiments were also conducted to study the sequential leaching of Al from cookware by preparing tea and coffee in the presence of standard size Al sheets (coupons). A small amount of Al was found to have leached from coupons during preparation of tea. Tea leaves, were found to be a rich source of Al and a maximum of 2.2% Al is extracted in tea infusions. Coffee powder on the other hand was not found to be a rich source of Al. Baking powder was found to be a rich source of Al and 1 kg of cake prepared with 1-3 teaspoon of baking powder may contain 2-12.7 mg of Al in each serving (25 g). Toothpaste also contains a significant quantity of Al, more so, when packed in Al tubes. Ingestion pattern of Al from these items by humans is also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Dayalbagh Educational Institute, Agra, India."}], "LastName": "Rajwanshi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shrivastav", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ramanamurthy", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dass", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Sci Total Environ", "NlmUniqueID": "0330500", "ISSNLinking": "0048-9697"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alum Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coffee"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toothpastes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "baking powder"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8MDF5V39QO", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WAT0DDB505", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Sulfate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alum Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coffee"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking and Eating Utensils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Bicarbonate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Toothpastes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9092078", "10.1016/s0048-9697(96)05347-8", "S0048969796053478"]}}]}
