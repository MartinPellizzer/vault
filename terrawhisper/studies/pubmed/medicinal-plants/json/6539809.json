Petroleum ether (A), CHCl3 (B), and aqueous (C) fractions, tested similarly in rats, were inactive and/or toxic. Partition of fraction B afforded non-acidic (D) and acidic (E) fractions. Savinin (1), isolated from fraction D and not previously reported from the Aristolochiaceae , was inactive when administered postcoitally to rats. Aristolochic acid-I (2), reported previously from A. indica and isolated from fraction E, was inactive when administered postcoitally to rats and toxic when administered postcoitally to hamsters. (12S)-7,12- Secoishwaran -12-ol (3), previously reported from A. indica and isolated from fraction A, did not interrupt pregnancy when administered to mice on day 6 of pregnancy. Four additional compounds, aristolic acid (4) [prepared from aristolochic acid-I (2)], methyl aristolate (5) [prepared by methylating aristolic acid (4)], and cis- and trans-p-coumaric acid (both oblate commercially), were similarly tested in mice and found to be inactive. Aristolic acid (4), and the cis- and trans-p-coumaric acids also were inactive when administered postcoitally (days 1-10) to rats. Seven compounds reported previously from A. indica were also isolated, as were a new naphthoquinone, aristolindiquinone (6) (fraction E), and magnoflorine (fraction C)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Che", "ForeName": "C T", "Initials": "CT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waller", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bingel", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rajamahendran", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bunyapraphatsara", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lankin", "ForeName": "D C", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cordell", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Estrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6539809", "10.1021/np50032a017"]}}]}
