The current review discusses the scope of some common medicinal herbs as well as secondary metabolites with a special focus on diabetes-mediated central nervous system complications. Literatures suggest that natural products reduce diabetes-mediated neurological complications partly by reducing oxidative stress and/or inflammation or apoptosis in certain brain regions. Natural products are known to modulate diabetes-mediated alterations in the level of acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, monoamine oxidase, serotonin receptors, muscarinic receptors, insulin receptor, nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and neuropeptide in brain. Further, there are several natural products reported to manage diabetic complications with unknown mechanism. In conclusion, medicinal plants or their secondary metabolites have a wide scope and possess therapeutic potential to effectively manage neurological complications associated with chronic diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Sita Sharan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Udayabanu", "ForeName": "Malairaman", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8711016", "ISSNLinking": "0334-1763"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Choline O-Acetyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Choline O-Acetyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28030360", "10.1515/revneuro-2016-0038", "/j/revneuro.ahead-of-print/revneuro-2016-0038/revneuro-2016-0038.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
