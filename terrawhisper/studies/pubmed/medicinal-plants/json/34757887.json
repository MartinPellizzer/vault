One such plant is <i>Berberis aristata</i> which is rich in vitamins, minerals, and various phytochemicals amongst which Berberine is the principal bioactive compound with a range of reported health benefits, and some of the commercial formulations like Rasaut, Darvyadi Leha are being used for the treatments of jaundice, malaria, typhoid fever, inflammation, eye infection, diarrhea, wound healing, etc. The hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, antitumor, anti-cancerous, properties are the recent additions to its functional importance. Berberine has significant bioactivities in the treatments of different diseases. Besides its remarkable applications, the berberine has low efficacy due to its low solubility in water, poor absorption, and low bioavailability. This problem can be solved by using some techniques like Nanotechnology which has been found to increase its solubility in water, bioavailability, and absorption and hence provide a better delivery system of berberine. This review illuminates the therapeutic applications of the plant <i>Berberis aristata</i>, scientific validation to its traditional uses, role of berberine in the treatment of various diseases through its different bioactivities, major flaws in berberine treatment, and the role of nanotechnology in minimizing those flaws and increasing its overall efficacy.Key teaching pointsPlant Berberis aristata has been used since ancient times for the treatment of various ailments like jaundice, hepatitis, fever, bleeding, inflammation, diarrhea, malaria, skin and eye infections, chronic rheumatism, and urinary disorders.Berberine is the major and most significant phytochemical among numerous phytochemicals present in plant Berberis aristata.Berberine has significantly shown many potent effect against emerging diseases like cancer and diabetes. Besides that, it has also shown antioxidant, anti-inflamation, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, and anti-gastrointestinal disorder properties.Berberine can be very effective in overcoming the demerits of berberine treatment like poor aqueous solubility, low bioavailability, and poor absorption in the human body in the treatment of various diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Technology and Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, India."}], "LastName": "Bhasin", "ForeName": "Jasleen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Technology and Nutrition, Lovely Professional University Faculty of Technology and Sciences, Phagwara, India."}], "LastName": "Thakur", "ForeName": "Baneet", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2264-9006"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Technology and Nutrition, Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Solan, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Satish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, PAU, Ludhiana, Ludhiana, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Nutr Assoc", "NlmUniqueID": "9918300687506676", "ISSNLinking": "2769-7061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Berberis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "56"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34757887", "10.1080/07315724.2021.1958104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
