After an initial run-in phase, 50 male subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned for 12 wk to one of four groups: 1) 900 mg garlic placebo/d + 12 g oil placebo/d; 2) 900 mg garlic/d + 12 g oil placebo/d; 3) 900 mg garlic placebo/d + 12 g fish oil/d, providing 3.6 g n-3 fatty acids/d; and 4) 900 mg garlic/d + 12 g fish oil/d. In the placebo group, mean serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triacylglycerols were not significantly changed in relation to baseline. Mean group total cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower with garlic+fish oil (-12.2%) and with garlic (-11.5%) after 12 wk but not with fish oil alone. Mean LDL-C concentrations were reduced with garlic+fish oil (-9.5%) and with garlic (-14.2%) but were raised with fish oil (+8.5%). Mean triacylglycerol concentrations were reduced with garlic+fish oil (-34.3%) and fish oil alone (-37.3%). The garlic groups (with and without fish oil) had significantly lower ratios of total cholesterol to high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-C to HDL-C. In summary, garlic supplementation significantly decreased both total cholesterol and LDL-C whereas fish-oil supplementation significantly decreased triacylglycerol concentrations and increased LDL-C concentrations in hypercholesterolemic men. The combination of garlic and fish oil reversed the moderate fish-oil-induced rise in LDL-C. Coadministration of garlic with fish oil was well-tolerated and had a beneficial effect on serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations by providing a combined lowering of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triacylglycerol concentrations as well as the ratios of total cholesterol to HDL-C and LDL-C to HDL-C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Biology, University of Guelph, Canada."}], "LastName": "Adler", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Holub", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fish Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Clin Nutr. 1997 Feb;65(2):560-1. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/65.2.560", "PMID": "9022544"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9022529", "10.1093/ajcn/65.2.445"]}}]}
