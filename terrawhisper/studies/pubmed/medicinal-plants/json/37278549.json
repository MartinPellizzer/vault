In March 2022, parasitism of broomrape, on coleus plants was found in a greenhouse (86\u00b0 3' 36\" E, 44\u00b0 18' 36\" N, 500 m elevation) at Shihezi University, Xinjiang, China. A few plants (6%) were parasitized with 2.5 emerged broomrape shoots per host plant. The host-parasite connection was confirmed by microscopy. Morphological characteristics of the host were consistent with coleus described by Cao et al. (2023). The broomrapes were: stem simple and slender, slightly bulbous at the base, glandular-pubescent; inflorescence usually many-flowered, lax, dense in the upper third; bracts 8 to 10 mm long, ovate-lanceolate; calyx segments free, entire, seldom bifid with markedly unequal subulate teeth; corolla markedly curvate, dorsal line inflected, white at the base, bluish violet in the upper part; stamens adaxial with filaments 6 to 7 mm long; abaxial stamens with filaments 7 to 10 mm long; gynoecium 7 to 10 mm long; ovary 4 to 5 mm long, glabrous; style with short glandular hairs; stigma white, keyed to sunflower broomrape (Orobanche cumana Wallr.) (Pujadas-Salv\u00e0 and Velasco 2000). Total genomic DNA of this parasite flowers was extracted and the trnL-F gene and ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were amplified using the primer pairs C/F and ITS1/ITS4, respectively (Taberlet et al. 1991; Anderson et al. 2004). Sequences of ITS (655 bp) and trnL-F (901 bp) were obtained (GenBank ON491818 and ON843707). BLAST analysis showed the ITS sequence was identical to that of sunflower broomrape (MK567978.1), also the trnL-F sequence matched that of sunflower broomrape (MW809408.1, identity 100%). Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses of the two sequences showed this parasite is clustered with sunflower broomrape. Together, morphological and molecular evidences confirmed the parasite on coleus plants was sunflower broomrape, a root holoparasitic plant with a narrow host range, which mainly posed a devastating threat to sunflower planting industry (Fern\u00e1ndez-Mart\u00ednez et al. 2015). To verify that coleus sunflower broomrape parasitic association, seedlings of this host were planted in 1.5-L pots containing compost-vermiculite-sand mixture (1:1:1 v:v:v) and sunflower broomrape seeds (50 mg seeds per 1 kg, soil). Three coleus seedlings, transplanted into pots without sunflower broomrape seeds, served as control. Ninety-six days later, the infected plants were smaller, their leaf color was observed to a lighter green than those of control plants and were similar to the broomrape-infected coleus plants observed in the greenhouse. The coleus roots with sunflower broomrape were carefully washed with running water, 10 to 15 emerged broomrape shoots and 14 to 22 underground attachments were observed on the coleus roots. The parasite grew well in coleus roots, from germination, attachment to host roots, and tubercles development. At the tubercle stage, the endophyte of sunflower broomrape had connected with the vascular bundle of the coleus root, confirming the sunflower broomrape-coleus connection. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first report of sunflower broomrape parasitizing coleus in Xinjiang, China. This indicates that sunflower broomrape can be propagated and survived by coleus, in fields or greenhouses with sunflower broomrape. To limit the spread of sunflower broomrape, preventive field management is needed for the coleus farmlands and greenhouse where the root holoparasite is prevalent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University College of Agriculture, 117455, Key Laboratory of Oasis Agricultural Pest Management and Plant Protection Resources Utilization, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shihezi University, Shihezi, China; tulanduocxl@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Xiaolei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University, Key Laboratory of Oasis Agricultural Pest Management and Plant Protection Resources Utilization, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shihezi University, ShiHeZi, Xinjiang, China; zhsf_agr@shzu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Sifeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University, The key Laboratory for Oasis crops disease prevention and cure of Shihezi University, ShiHeZi, Xinjiang, China; 1162624941@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University, 70586, Analysis and Testing Center, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China; tingli.hao@foxmail.com."}], "LastName": "Hao", "ForeName": "Tingli", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University, 70586, Key Laboratory of Oasis Agricultural Pest Management and Plant Protection Resources Utilization, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, China; 2429735451@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shihezi University College of Agriculture, 117455, Key Laboratory of Oasis Agricultural Pest Management and Plant Protection Resources Utilization, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Shihezi University, Shihezi, China; yaozhaoqun@sina.com."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Zhaoqun", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37278549", "10.1094/PDIS-04-23-0762-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
