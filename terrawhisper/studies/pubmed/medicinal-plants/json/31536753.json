PDE inhibitors (PDEIs) have been attractive therapeutic targets due to their involvement in diverse medical conditions, e.g. cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), etc. Among them; AD with a complex pathology is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder which affect mostly senile people in the world and only symptomatic treatment particularly using cholinesterase inhibitors in clinic is available at the moment for AD. Consequently, novel treatment strategies towards AD are still searched extensively. Since PDEs are broadly expressed in the brain, PDEIs are considered to modulate neurodegenerative conditions through regulating cAMP and cGMP in the brain. In this sense, several synthetic or natural molecules inhibiting various PDE subtypes such as rolipram and roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitors), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), cilostazol and milrinone (PDE3 inhibitors), sildenafil and tadalafil (PDE5 inhibitors), etc have been reported showing encouraging results for the treatment of AD. In this review, PDE superfamily will be scrutinized from the view point of structural features, isoforms, functions and pharmacology particularly attributed to PDEs as target for AD therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
