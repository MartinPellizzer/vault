These properties open a possible role for BK-activators (also called BK-openers) and/or BK-blockers as effective therapeutic agents for different neurological, urological, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The synthetic benzimidazolone derivatives NS004 and NS1619 are the pioneer BK-activators and have represented the reference models which led to the design of several novel and heterogeneous synthetic BK-openers, while very few synthetic BK-blockers have been reported. Even today, the research towards identifying new BK-modulating agents is proceeding with great impetus and is giving an ever-increasing number of new molecules. Among these, also a handsome number of natural BK-modulator compounds, belonging to different structural classes, has appeared in the literature. The goal of this paper is to provide a possible simple classification of the broad structural heterogeneity of the natural BK-activating agents (terpenes, phenols, flavonoids) and blockers (alkaloids and peptides), and a concise overview of their chemical and pharmacological properties as well as potential therapeutic applications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, Pisa, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nardi", "ForeName": "Antonio", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calderone", "ForeName": "Vincenzo", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chericoni", "ForeName": "Silvio", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morelli", "ForeName": "Ivano", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channel Blockers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "153587-01-0", "NameOfSubstance": "NS 1619"}, {"RegistryNumber": "20662-53-7", "NameOfSubstance": "benzimidazolone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54425-30-8", "NameOfSubstance": "NS 004"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzimidazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channel Blockers"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists", "antagonists & inhibitors", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated"}], "NumberOfReferences": "69"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14648389", "10.1055/s-2003-45095"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
