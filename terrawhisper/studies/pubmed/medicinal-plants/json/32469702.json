GL belongs to genus Gentiana, which is a rich natural source of iridoids, secoiridoids, xantones, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and carbohydrates. Medicinal plants from Gentiana species have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-mitogenic, anti-proliferative, and lipidlowering effects, as well as a cardioprotective, hypotensive, vasodilator and anti-platelet activities.", "We reviewed the recent literature related to the effects of Gentiana species, and their active components on vascular diseases.", "Data used for this review were obtained by searching the electronic database [PUBMED/ MEDLINE 1973 - February 2020].
