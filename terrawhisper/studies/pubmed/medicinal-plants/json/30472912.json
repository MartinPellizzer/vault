Jatrorrhizine is an active ingredient found in various traditional Chinese medicinal plants. Based on our previous finding that jatrorrhizine was a potent inhibitor of OCT2 and OCT3, the aim of the present study was to explore whether jatrorrhizine has an antidepressant-like action action via inhibition of uptake-2 transporters. 2. <i>In vitro</i> uptake tests showed that jatrorrhizine strongly inhibited PMAT-mediated MPP<sup>+</sup> uptake with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.05\u2009\u03bcM and reduced 5-HT and NE uptake mediated by hOCT2, hOCT3 and hPMAT with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.1-1\u2009\u03bcM (for OCT2 and OCT3) and 1-10\u2009\u03bcM (for PMAT). 3. In mouse synaptosomes, jatrorrhizine suppressed 5-HT and NE uptake in a concentration dependently manner, where the role of uptake-2 inhibition is significant. 4. The antidepressant-like action of jatrorrhizine was evaluated by mouse tail suspension test (TST). The TST showed that one week of jatrorrhizine (5, 10 and 20\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) or venlafaxine (20\u2009mg/kg, i.g.) can significantly reduce the duration of immobility when compared with vehicle control group. 5. The concentration of jatrorrhizine shows a dose-dependent increase in brain tissues. 6. Our study suggested that jatrorrhizine might be used as an antidepressant agent via inhibition of uptake-2 transporters."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Dermatology and Venereology, School of Medicine , Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Siyuan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Sisi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Shaowei", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Shujie", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Huidi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis and Drug Metabolism, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Xenobiotica", "NlmUniqueID": "1306665", "ISSNLinking": "0049-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Cation Transporter 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Slc22a2 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "091S1F8V5Q", "NameOfSubstance": "jatrorrhizine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7D7RX5A8MO", "NameOfSubstance": "Venlafaxine Hydrochloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Cation Transporter 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Venlafaxine Hydrochloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30472912", "10.1080/00498254.2018.1542188"]}}]}
