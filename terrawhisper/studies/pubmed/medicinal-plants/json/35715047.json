These compounds were tested for their activities against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) by the conventional half-leaf method and the outcomes were analyzed by western blotting and RT-PCR assays. The three tested compounds, at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, showed strong antiviral activities in the pretreated tobacco plants with inhibition rates ranging from 70.5% to 81.3%, which were significantly higher than that of the positive control, ningnanmycin (55.6%). Their potential of inducing systemic acquired resistance (SAR) was also evaluated, in which compound 1 showed excellent induction activities. Furthermore, it was found that potentiation of defense-related enzyme activity and the contents of SA was increased. Compound 1 could also inhibit the expression of TMV CP and up-regulate the expression of defense-related genes. This work revealed that these limonoids, especially compound 1 could induce resistance in tobacco plants against the viral pathogen TMV. Meanwhile, compounds 1-3 could down-regulate the expression of NtHsp70-1 and Nthsp70-261 genes, indicating that these limonoids possibly inhibit TMV infection by suppressing NtHsp70-1 and Nthsp70-261 expression. This study is the first to report antiviral compounds with two different mechanisms of action."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
