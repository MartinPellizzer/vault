Three compounds PS-01\u2009A, PS-01B and PS-02\u2009A were isolated. PS-01\u2009A and PS-01B were identified by comparative TLC with authentic marker compounds followed by NMR analysis. Further PS-01B was analyzed by HR-GCMS. PS-02\u2009A was subjected to HR-LCMS.

Two of which, namely, PS-01\u2009A (oleanolic acid) and PS-02\u2009A (unknown) were found to be terpenoids and PS-01B was identified as steroid (stigmasterol). PS-02\u2009A compound is to be purified and characterized further. All three compounds PS-01\u2009A, PS-01B, PS-02\u2009A showed cytotoxicity by BSL bioassay (LC<sub>50</sub> value of 54.49, 30.83, 16.32\u2009ppm, respectively) and by cell line study where isolate PS-02\u2009A has shown more cytotoxicity with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 66.77 and 53.72\u2009\u03bcg/mL with A549 and HepG2 cells, respectively, when compared with other isolates.", "Bioactivity guided fractionation of Premna serratifolia leaves succeeded into isolation of two terpenoids and one steroid compound with significant cytotoxic activity.
