Western blotting was utilized for assessing p65-NF-\u03baB phosphorylation. Ransod kits evaluated the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the cell lysates. Ultimately, the molecular docking approach was performed to investigate the biological activity of Quercetin against NF-\u03baB pathway proteins and antioxidant enzymes.", "The findings revealed that quercetin significantly attenuated the expression and secretion of inflammatory mediators and p65-NF-\u03baB phosphorylation in LPS-induced PBMCs. Additionally, quercetin dose-dependently improved the activities of SOD and GPx enzymes and decreased LPS-mediated oxidative stress in PBMCs. Moreover, quercetin has a considerable binding affinity to I\u03baKb, the core element of the NF-\u03baB pathway and the antioxidant enzyme SOD.", "The data show that quercetin plays a vital role in ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress caused by LPS in PBMCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Development Center, \"The Persian Gulf Martyrs\" Hospital, Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, Bushehr, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bastin", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran."}], "LastName": "Teimouri", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faramarz", "ForeName": "Sanaz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shabani", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences and Cosmetic Products Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Asie", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37005541", "10.2174/1381612829666230330084043", "CPD-EPUB-130492"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
