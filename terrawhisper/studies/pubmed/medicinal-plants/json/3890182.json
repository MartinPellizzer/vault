However, most species of higher plants have never been described, much less surveyed for chemical or biologically active constituents, and new sources of commercially valuable materials remain to be discovered. Advances in biotechnology, particularly methods for culturing plant cells and tissues, should provide new means for the commercial processing of even rare plants and the chemicals they produce. These new technologies will extend and enhance the usefulness of plants as renewable resources of valuable chemicals. In the future, biologically active plant-derived chemicals can be expected to play an increasingly significant role in the commercial development of new products for regulating plant growth and for insect and weed control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Balandrin", "ForeName": "M F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Klocke", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wurtele", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bollinger", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Science", "NlmUniqueID": "0404511", "ISSNLinking": "0036-8075"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "65"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3890182", "10.1126/science.3890182"]}}]}
