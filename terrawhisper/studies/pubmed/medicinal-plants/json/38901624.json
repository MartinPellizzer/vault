Their structures and absolute configurations were determined based on HRESIMS, and NMR, combined with calculated ECD and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses. Subsequently, all compounds except 10 were evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the production of nitric oxide induced by lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophage cells. The results indicated that seven compounds (1, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22, and 23) exhibited significant NO inhibitory effects, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.35 to 5.93\u00a0\u03bcM, which were more effective than the positive control indomethacin (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a013.18\u00a0\u03bcM). Moreover, the corresponding results of Western blot analysis revealed that meliasanine A (1) can significantly suppress the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase 2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The mechanism study suggested that meliasanine A exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via the nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway by suppressing phosphorylation of P65 and I\u03baB\u03b1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
