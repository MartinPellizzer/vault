Five PAHs including acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene are chosen as target analytes to evaluate the performance of the material by GC-FID analysis. The mesoporous Al-MCM-41 composite was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurement, and thermogravimetric analysis. The parameters affecting the extraction efficiency of HS-SPME were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the method exhibits ideal linearity for target analytes in the range of 0.3-600 ng\u22c5mL<sup>-1</sup> with the coefficients (R<sup>2</sup>) equal or higher than 0.9906. The enrichment factors are calculated from 540 to 1760. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantitation (LOQs) are between the ranges of 0.06-0.18 and 0.3-0.9 ng\u22c5mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) (n\u00a0=\u00a05) of intra-day and inter-day are in the ranges of 1.08-7.49% and 2.84-18.3% respectively. The fiber-to-fiber reproducibility (n\u00a0=\u00a03) is in the range of 6.47-13.9%. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of PAHs in human urine with reasonable recoveries which is ranging from 73.29 to 116.1%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
