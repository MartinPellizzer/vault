The herb Chloranthus fortunei (A. Gray) Solms-Laub is known as \"Si Ji Feng\" and is classified as a Feng-type medicine in classic Yao medicines. According to Yao's medical beliefs, Chloranthus fortunei has the functions of dispelling Feng, regulating qi, detoxifying, promoting blood circulation, etc. Folk uses its decoctions to treat stagnant liver conditions, such as liver abscesses, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer. However, the bioactivity and mechanisms of Chloranthus fortunei extract against HCC have not been reported.", "To investigate the anti-HCC bioactivity and potential mechanism of the extract of Chloranthus fortunei (CFS).", "Using 70% ethanol for reflux extraction of CFS resulted in the CFS ethanol extract, followed by sequential extractions with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol, yielding four fractions. The CCK-8 assay was utilized to examine the cytotoxic effects of 4 fractions on MHCC97-H and HepG2 cells, exploring the most effective component, namely petroleum ether extracts of CFS (PECFS). The major active ingredients of PECFS were identified using LC/MS technology, and the impact on cell proliferation and apoptosis in HCC cells was studied. The key genes and proteins in the pathway were validated using RT-PCR and Western blotting. BALB/c nude mice were chosen for tumor xenotransplantation and PECFS therapy. hinders the proliferation of HCC cells and promotes apoptosis.", "Among the four fractions, it was found that PECFS have the highest antiproliferative activity against MHCC97-H and HepG2 cells (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a013.86, 10.55\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), with sesquiterpene compounds being the primary active constituents. The antiproliferative activity of PECFS on HCC cells was linked to the inhibition of cell cloning, invasion, and metastasis abilities, as well as the arrest of the cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Additionally, exerts pro-apoptotic effects on HCC cells by upregulating the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, downregulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and activating the expression of the Caspase family. Moreover, protein and m-RNA expression data showed that PECFS inhibits HCC cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Besides, after PECFS treatment, tumor growth in nude mice was suppressed.", "PECFS can inhibit the viability of HCC cells by acting on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, demonstrating anti-tumor potential. This study's findings suggest that PECFS may represent a promising source of novel agents for liver cancer treatment, providing scientific evidence for the traditional application of CFS in treating HCC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
