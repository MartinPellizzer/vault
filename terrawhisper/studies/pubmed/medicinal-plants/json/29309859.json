The medicinal plants in the present study are traditionally used to treat cancer in Kakamega County as recorded in published literature.", "Due to multidrug resistance (MDR) and severe side effects of currently used drugs in clinical oncology, new candidate compounds are urgently required to improve treatment outcome. The present study explored the in vitro cytotoxic potential of 34 organic and 19 aqueous extracts of Kakamega medicinal plants towards sensitive and multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines.", "The cytotoxicity was determined using the resazurin assay. Eight organic and two aqueous plant extracts inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by more than 50%. The organic extracts were Harungana madagascariensis Lam. ex poir (6.6% of untreated control), Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman (19.4%), Entada abyssinica Steud. ex A. Rich (38.6%), Phyllanthus fischeri Pax (40.7%), Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser Synonym: Sapium ellipticum (Hochst. kraus) Pax (41.8%), Bridelia micrantha (Hochst.) Baill (45.4%) and Futumia africana Benth. (45.8%) and Microglossa pyrifolia (Lam.) Kuntze (48%). The aqueous extracts were Bridelia micrantha (Hochst.) Baill (31.3%) and Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser Synonym: Sapium ellipticum (Hochst. Kraus) Pax (48.2%). In addition to P-glycoprotein-expressing tumor cells, we also investigated other mechanisms of drug resistance, i.e. BCRP- or EGFR-transfected and TP53-knockout tumor cells. Some extracts also showed considerable cytotoxic activity against these drug-resistant cell lines. As demonstrated for selected examples, some extracts exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, if applied in combination with other extracts.", "The panel of medicinal plants used in the Kakamega County for cancer treatment revealed indeed cytotoxicity to various extent towards cancer cells in vitro. Hence, our results may at least in part substantiate the traditional use of these compounds to treat cancer. Even more interesting, several extracts inhibited otherwise drug-resistant tumor cell lines with similar or even better efficacy than their drug-sensitive counterparts. This provides an attractive perspective for further exploration of their anticancer potential to combat drug resistance of refractory tumors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
