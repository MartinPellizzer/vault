Owing to the structural change of lignin and elimination of hemicellulose during the decoction of raw Achyranthes root, the thermogravimetric analysis results show a large difference between the derivative thermogravimetry curves of spent and raw Achyranthes roots. The average apparent activation energy value of spent Achyranthes root, obtained from the non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, are found to be lower than those of raw Achyranthes root. This comes as a result of the much lower content of hemicellulose in spent Achyranthes root caused by the hemicellulose elimination from raw Achyranthes root during the decoction process. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root over HZSM5-30 (HZSM-5 with SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a030) and HY30 (HY with SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u00a0=\u00a030) was performed using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor system. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root over both HY30 and HZSM5-30 produced the much larger amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the non-catalytic fast pyrolysis, with a parallel decrease of oxygen-containing pyrolyzates. Owing to its robust pore structure and high acidity, it was the HZSM5-30 that produced the highest quality oil during the catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root, having higher selectivity of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons compared to HY30."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
