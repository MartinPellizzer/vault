Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that metabolises the ACh at synaptic cleft resulting in Alzheimer's disease. Medicinal plants have been used to treat numerous ailments and improve human health from ancient time. A traditional system of medicine is long recognised for its effective management of neurological disorders. The present review confers the scope of some common medicinal plants with a special focus on AChE-mediated central nervous system complications especially Alzheimer's disease. Literature suggests that medicinal plants reduce neuronal dysfunctions by reducing AChE activity in different brain regions. In some instances, activation of AChE activity by medicinal plants also showed therapeutic potential. In conclusion, medicinal plants have a wide scope and possess therapeutic potential to efficiently manage neurological disorders associated with AChE dysregulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Pharmacy, Bhopal 462041, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Sita Sharan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Pharmacy, Bhopal 462041, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Raghuwanshi", "ForeName": "Ramsaneh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Pharmacy, Bhopal 462041, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Masood", "ForeName": "Misha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Pharmacy, Bhopal 462041, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Acharya", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Sagar Institute of Research and Technology-Pharmacy, Bhopal 462041, Madhya Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "Surendra Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Rev Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8711016", "ISSNLinking": "0334-1763"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nervous System Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29303784", "10.1515/revneuro-2017-0054", "/j/revneuro.ahead-of-print/revneuro-2017-0054/revneuro-2017-0054.xml"]}}]}
