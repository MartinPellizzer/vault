Aimed to facilitate vascular regeneration, we developed a vascular scaffold loaded with resveratrol, which is a natural compound extracted from plants and showed multifaceted effects in cardiovascular protection. The tubular poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold was prepared by electrospinning with resveratrol in the PCL solution. In vitro assay demonstrated that resveratrol could be released from the scaffolds in a sustained and controlled manner. Cell culture results indicated that the migration of endothelial cells (ECs), nitric oxide production, and the ability of tube formation increased in the resveratrol-containing PCL scaffold groups compared with the PCL control. Meanwhile, the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, the main proinflammatory factor secreted from macrophages, was reduced, and the messenger RNA expressions of the M2 macrophage-related genes were increased in the resveratrol-containing group. Further, in vivo implantation was performed by replacing rat abdominal aorta. We observed fast endothelialization and enhanced vascular regeneration in rats with resveratrol-containing scaffolds. The presence of resveratrol also induced a large number of M2 macrophages to infiltrate into the graft wall. Taken together, the incorporation of resveratrol into the PCL grafts enhanced the vascular regeneration by modulation of ECs and macrophages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College , Tianjin 300192, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhihong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yifan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jianing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College , Tianjin 300192, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chuangnian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Hongyu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Meifeng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Kai", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College , Tianjin 300192, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Division, King's College London BHF Centre , London SE5 9NU, U.K."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qingbo", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5520-0769"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Biomaterial Research, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College , Tianjin 300192, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials, Ministry of Education, College of Life Science, Nankai University , Tianjin 300071, China."}], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Deling", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24980-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "polycaprolactone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyesters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Scaffolds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28539044", "10.1021/acsami.6b16573"]}}]}
