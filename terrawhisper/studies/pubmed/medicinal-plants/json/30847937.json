Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21)/Smad3 signaling is aberrantly induced in DN, leading to elevated microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression and tissue fibrosis. Ski-related novel protein (SnoN) negatively regulates the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, but the relationship between SnoN and miR-21 has not been described in the context of DN. In this study, this association was investigated in vivo (streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes) and in vitro (NRK-52E model system under high glucose conditions). In both model systems, we observed reduced amounts of the SnoN protein and elevated miR-21 amounts, indicative of an inverse relationship. These changes in SnoN and miR-21 amounts were accompanied by reduced E-cadherin and elevated \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and collagen III levels, consistent with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vitro overexpression of SnoN in NRK-52E cells downregulated miR-21 at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and repressed EMT and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. In contrast, knockdown of SnoN resulted in miR-21 upregulation, particularly at the transcriptional level. We further demonstrated that overexpression and inhibition of miR-21 promoted and suppressed EMT and ECM deposition, respectively, without affecting SnoN levels. Our results indicated that SnoN suppresses the development of DN as well as renal fibrosis by downregulating miR-21, and therefore represents a novel and promising therapeutic target for DN."],
