In this study, we induced a fear-conditioning model in rats and investigated freezing (PTSD-like) behavior, 21\u00a0days after three shocks exposure (0.6\u00a0mA, 3\u00a0s, 30\u00a0seconds interval) in both male and female rats. Lithium was injected intraperitoneally (100\u00a0mg/kg) in three protocols: (1) 1\u00a0h after fear-conditioning (2) 1\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, and 48\u00a0h after fear-conditioning (3), 1\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h, and 96\u00a0h after fear-conditioning. Extinction training (20 sounds without shocks, 75\u00a0dB, 3\u00a0s, 30\u00a0seconds interval) was performed in three protocols: (1) 1\u00a0h after fear-conditioning (one session), (2) 1\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, and 48\u00a0h after fear-conditioning (three sessions), (3), 1\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h, and 96\u00a0h after fear-conditioning (five sessions). Forced swim test (FST) and hot plate were used to assess behavior. Results showed that lithium in all protocols had no effect on freezing behavior, FST, and pain subthreshold in all rats. Extinction training decreased freezing behavior, with more efficacy in females. In males, only 5-session training was effective, while in females all protocols were effective. Extinction training also altered pain perception and the results of FST, depending on the sessions and was different in males and females. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA level was increased in females following 3 and 5 sessions, and in males following 5 sessions extinction training. In conclusion, we suggested that there is a sex difference for the effect of extinction training on freezing behavior and BDNF mRNA level in a rat model of fear-conditioning."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
