With SnO<sub>2</sub> as a model of a typical wide-band semiconductor, we report the tuning from UV-responsive SnO<sub>2</sub> to blue SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals with imaging ability and a Sb-doping-dependent photothermal effect. Sb-Doped SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals were prepared by heating SbCl<sub>3</sub> and SnCl<sub>4</sub> in benzyl alcohol solution through a facile solvothermal route. When the SbCl<sub>3</sub>/SnCl<sub>4</sub> molar ratio increases from 0 to 0.2/1, the obtained samples exhibit an increased photothermal effect under the irradiation of a 1064 nm laser, accompanied by gradually decreased size and crystallinity. With a further increase of the molar ratio from 0.3/1.0 to 1.0/1.0, the resulting samples demonstrate the tetragonal SnO<sub>2</sub> phase with amorphous-like compounds and they show no obvious enhancement of a photothermal effect. After a surface modification with biological molecules, the optimized Sb<sub>0.2</sub>-SnO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals demonstrated good stability and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 48.3% as well as low cytotoxicity. When Sb<sub>0.2</sub>-SnO<sub>2</sub> was injected into a tumor of mice, the tumor could be simultaneously detected by X-ray computed tomography (CT) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging, and then thermally ablated when exposed to a 1064 nm laser. Therefore, these nanocrystals can be used as \"all-in-one\" type nanoagents for imaging guided photothermal ablation of tumors under the irradiation of a laser in the second bio-transparent window."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University, Shanghai 201620, China. zgchen@dhu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Nuo", "Initials": "N", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhaojie", "Initials": "Z", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zixiao", "Initials": "Z", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Zhigao", "Initials": "Z", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Meifang", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiaogang", "Initials": "X", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhigang", "Initials": "Z", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanoscale", "NlmUniqueID": "101525249", "ISSNLinking": "2040-3364"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tin Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KM7N50LOS6", "NameOfSubstance": "stannic oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phototherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Theranostic Nanomedicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tin Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29349469", "10.1039/c7nr08811f"]}}]}
