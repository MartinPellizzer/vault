Bountiful), a resistant host for SBMV-C. Tissue prints of bean primary leaves doubly inoculated with SHMV and SBMV-C, developed by Western blotting, showed the presence of the SBMV-C capsid antigen in the mesophyll and epidermis, but no antigen was detected in the conducting bundles. Typical SBMV-C virions were not seen in electron micrographs of immunogold-labelled mesophyll cells; instead, specifically labelled, amorphous protein clumps were found in the vacuole. Particles of smaller diameter than that of typical SBMV-C virions were specifically trapped by SBMV antibodies following immunosorbent electron microscopy of extracts from doubly infected leaves. SBMV-C coat protein from infected Vigna unguiculata L. (cowpea) and bean plants showed no difference in its mobility following electrophoresis in denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Lack of efficient assembly of SBMV-C virions does not impede cell-to-cell movement of the virus in doubly infected leaves of bean, yet it is probably an important factor in determining the inability of SBMV-C to move into and/or through the vascular system of this host."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Science, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."}], "LastName": "Fuentes", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamilton", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Capsid"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Immunoelectron"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Virion"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8376965", "10.1099/0022-1317-74-9-1903"]}}]}
