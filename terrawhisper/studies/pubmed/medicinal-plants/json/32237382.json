Through visiting and field investigation,collecting the distribution information of Ek samples,and based on the four kinds of flavonoids in Ek,the high-quality production areas and distribution of Ek distribution of the main environmental factors were drawn using GIS technology,the maximum entropy model( MaxEnt),geographical detector statistical analysis method,and the statistical significance of regression equation were obtained. Considering the content of 4 main flavonoids in Ek,the results of this study showed that the main environmental factors,such as precipitation,annual precipitation variation coefficient,annual average temperature and clay content exhibited the greatest influence on the growth suitability of Ek. Ek materials quality concentrated distribution in southeastern Jilin province Changbai mountain hinterland and northeastern Liaoning province. Ek with high content of epimedine A and epimedine C are mainly distributed in the southeastern Jilin province and northeastern Liaoning province,Ek with high epimedine B is distributed in eastern Liaoning province; high icariin Ek was found in most area of northeastern Liaoning province,a small amount distributed in the southeast of Jilin province. This study predicted the climate suitability distribution of Ek,and provided reference for the rational planning and establishment of the standardized cultivation base of Ek."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying-Zhe", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Affiliated Hospital of Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Changchun 130021,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yu-Cui", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs,National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medical,China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100070,China."}], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xian", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Jun-Jie", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Da-Cheng", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changchun University of Traditional Chinese Medicine School of Pharmacy Changchun 130117,China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jing-Lei", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Climate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237382", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191009.108"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
