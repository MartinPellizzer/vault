Remedies such as laetril, shark cartilage, high dose vitamins and many alternative medical practices have been used with little evidence of improvement and sometimes worsened outcome. It is disconcerting that attempts to scientifically discredit these treatments sometimes result in the development of conspiracy theories. However, some plants do contain anticancer agents, the vinca alkaloids (derived from the Madagascar periwinkle) and paclitaxel (derived from the pacific yew tree) are examples of success stories. Extensive screening of tens of thousands of plants has unfortunately revealed only a handful of potential cancer cures. An evidence based approach to alternative treatment in malignancy is appropriate and this seventh article in this series reviews the evidence."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nambour General Hospital, Queensland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pinn", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust Fam Physician", "NlmUniqueID": "0326701", "ISSNLinking": "0300-8495"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11458587"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
