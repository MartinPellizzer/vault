Evaluation of their in vitro cytotoxic activity showed that some of the targets demonstrated potent inhibitory effects against HCT-116 and MCF-7 cancer cells. The IC<sub>50</sub> values ranged between 21.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1 and 28.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively, whereas those of doxorubicin (reference drug) ranged between 22.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 and 19.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. The active targets 6, 7 and 9 exhibited very weak cytotoxicity on normal cells (RPE-1) and showed higher IC<sub>50</sub> values against HCT-116 and MCF-7 cells in comparison to doxorubicin. Furthermore, compounds 7, 9 and 10 inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 by the induction of apoptosis. The bioassay results in the regression plots generated in 3D QSAR models were in agreement and correlated with the anticancer results of the target molecules. The 4-hydazinobenzoic acid derivatives can be used as cornerstones for further structural modifications as future anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
