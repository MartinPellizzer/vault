In this study, we have investigated the effect of kaempferol on the proliferation of primary cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Kaempferol significantly inhibited 50 ng/mL platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced proliferation and [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA at concentrations of 5, 20 and 50 microM without any cytotoxicity. Kaempferol also inhibited the c-fos mRNA expression induced by PDGF-BB concentration-dependently. In addition, consistent with the inhibition of cell proliferation and c-fos mRNA expression, kaempferol inhibited the PDGF beta-receptor (Rbeta) phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Accordingly, the downstream signal transductions of PDGF-Rbeta such as ERK1/2, Akt and PLC-gamma1 phosphorylation were also inhibited by kaempferol in the same pattern. These findings suggest that, in addition to its anti-oxidant activity, the cardiovascular protective effect of kaempferol may be mediated, at least in part, by the suppression of VSMC proliferation, which is due to the inhibition of PDGF-Rbeta tyrosine phosphorylation and its downstream intracellular signal transduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Soo-Yeon", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Yong-Ri", "Initials": "YR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lim", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jin-Ho", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Mi-Ra", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Jin-Tae", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Hwan-Soo", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Yeo-Pyo", "Initials": "YP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1B56C968OA", "NameOfSubstance": "Becaplermin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.10.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Becaplermin"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16041643", "10.1055/s-2005-871263"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
