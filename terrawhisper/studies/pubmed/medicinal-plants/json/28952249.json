Although the DNA barcode method based on ITS2 is popular and has been used in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, its low discriminatory efficiency is still a problem to its extensive application. Therefore, further study is still necessary to explore its phylogenetic information for medicinal plants identification. In cells, ITS2 activity is based on its secondary structure. The secondary structures are particularly useful in phylogenetic analysis because they include information not found in the primary sequence. In this study ITS2 secondary structure of 40 samples from 26 species were predicted and used to explore their utility in addressing the identification problems of Chinese traditional medicine in Solanum. The secondary structures were predicted and aligned, and their consensus models were generated using the three different software of LocARNA, MASTR and PicXAA-R. RNAstat software was used to transform the secondary structures into 28 symbol code data for maximum parsimony (MP) analysis. The results showed that the phylogenetic information increased 88.57% after ITS2 secondary structure information has been added, and then the support values above 50%, 75% and 90% in the tree increased 19.05%, 66.67% and 66.67%, respectively, indicating that the identification of Solanum medical plants has been well resolved. Thus, our analysis suggests that ITS2 secondary structure information should be incorporated into the current DNA barcoding analysis as a beneficial supplement of phylogenetic information."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yuan", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Mei-Hui", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Feng-Xi", "Initials": "FX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine College, Shandong University at Weihai, Weihai 264209, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Education Ministry Key Laboratory of City Inteligenlizing and Environment Modeling, Urumqi 830046, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28952249", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170103.003"]}}]}
