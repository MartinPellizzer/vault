Still, there is a dearth of information as regards experimental evidence generated from medicinal plants that would yield pharmacological agents for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Acridocarpus Smeathmannii (DC.) Guill. & Perr. Root (ASR) has a long history as an aphrodisiac in African traditional medicine. Thus, this study investigated the reproductive potentials and associated biochemical mechanisms of its hydroethanolic extract (HEASR) in male Wistar rats. Also, the bioactive compounds were identified.", "Fifty-four male albino rats (180\u202f\u00b1\u202f20\u202fg) were divided into nine groups of six rats/group. Control, group 1 received normal saline (10\u202fmL/kg). Groups 2-6 rats were administered sildenafil (1.43\u202fmg/kg/day), mesterolone (0.36\u202fmg/kg/day), doxazocin (0.03\u202fmg/kg/day), HEASR1 (50\u202fmg/kg/day) and HEASR2 (200\u202fmg/kg/day) respectively. Others received co-administration of HEASR2 with standard drugs. Treatment lasted for 28 days via oral gavage.", "An acute oral toxicity of HEASR up to 2\u202fg/kg produced no mortality in mice p.o. while the median lethal dose was estimated to be 810\u202fmg/kg i.p. HEASR2 administration or in combination with sildenafil, mesterolone and doxazocin increased mounting frequencies on day 28 by 77.44%, 122.65%, 148.5% and 93.88% and sperm counts by 38.29%, 55.21%, 42.48%, and 48.98% respectively in treated rats. HEASR2\u202f+\u202fsildenafil elevated testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone levels by 36.33% and 24.55% while HEASR2\u202f+\u202fdoxazocin elevated luteinizing hormone levels by 97.44% in rats. HEASR modulated prostate-specific antigen and malondialdehyde levels respectively. Reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were raised in five selected organs. Serum nitric oxide but not cyclooxygenase-2 or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels was moderately improved in rats.", "Overall, the results obtained demonstrated the potential of HEASR as a male reproductive enhancer, thus justify its folklore applications. Further, octadecanoic acid ethyl ester was the most abundant bioactive component present."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
