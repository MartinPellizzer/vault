The subjects were initially established on a low-fat background diet (29% of energy from fat) and then 55 g low-fibre oat bran, 55 g high-fibre oat bran or 80 g mixed cooked beans were added to their diet in random order for 6 week periods. Body weight and overall composition of the diet did not change. Plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were unchanged. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly higher on all three intervention diets than on the lower fibre run-in diet. Supplementation of a moderately low-fat diet with palatable quantities of oat bran or beans without changing the overall fat intake does not appear to significantly lower cholesterol but may have a benefit by increasing HDL-C and reducing the ratio of LDL-C to HDL-C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Nutrition, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand."}], "LastName": "Mackay", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ball", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8804070", "ISSNLinking": "0954-3007"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1327742"]}}]}
