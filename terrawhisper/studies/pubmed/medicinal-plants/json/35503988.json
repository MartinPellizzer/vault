The complex and diverse components bring great challenges to its bioactivity study. To comprehensively analyze the bioactivity of an herbal prescription, a new strategy based on peak-by-peak cutting and knock-out chromatography was proposed. In this strategy, active compounds were screened out via peak-by-peak cutting from an herbal extract, and the influence of a compound on the overall activity of the herbal extract was evaluated by knock-out chromatography. Qiliqiangxin capsule is an herbal prescription composed of 11 herbal medicines for the treatment of chronic heart failure. A total of 71 peaks were collected through peak-by-peak cutting, and each peak was identified by a high-resolution mass spectrum. The bioassay against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl showed that two types of compounds namely salvianolic acids and caffeoylquinic acids were potent scavengers. Knock-out chromatography suggested that the removal of one single compound had no obvious influence on the overall activity of the Qiliqiangxin capsule. After all the main peaks in the Qiliqiangxin capsule were knocked out, the remaining part still exhibited a potent activity, indicating high activity stability of the Qiliqiangxin capsule. The proposed strategy is helpful for the comprehensive analysis of the bioactivity of other herbal prescriptions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Liaoning Province for Identification and Quality Evaluation of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Dalian, P.
