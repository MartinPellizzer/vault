A DFS preparation (DFS aqueous-extract) was extracted with distilled water. The modeled rats were administrated by perfusion with DFS aqueous-extract at a dosage of 15 g crude drug/kg once a day for 10, 20 and 30 d, respectively. The effects of DFS aqueous extract on experimental alveolar bone resorption were estimated by detections of serum alkali phosphate (ALP) activity, Ca2+ and osteocalcin (OC) levels, and TRAP stained osteoclast count, bone mineral density (BMD) measurement and HE stained histopathological examination of the tooth-periodontal samples.", "In comparison with the controls, BMD values of the alveolar bones at experimental tooth sites of the tested rats with DFS aqueous-extract for 10 d administration were obviously increased (P < 0.05). In the tooth-periodontal samples from the rats for 10 d administration, disappearance of the osteoclast, decrease of Howship's lacuna numbers and formation of new non-calcified bone-like matrix attached by osteoblasts in alveolar bone at the root furcation from most of the samples occurred. Similar examining results in the tooth-periodontal samples from the rats for 20 and 30 d administrations were obtained, respectively. However, no statistically significant differences of the serum ALP activity, Ca2+ and OC levels among the tested rats for 10-30 d treatment and the controls (P > 0.05) were found.", "The DFS aqueous extract has exact therapeutic effect on rat experimental alveolar bone resorption through suppressing bone resorption and promoting bone regeneration. Serum ALP activity, Ca2+ and osteocalcin (OC) levels can not be used as the effective index for examining alveolar bone resorption and regeneration in animal models."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stomatology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medical Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Li-li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104982-03-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Osteocalcin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alveolar Bone Loss"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Osteocalcin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polypodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15706922"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
