This review aims to summarize the photochemical reports and biological activities of quinolizidine alkaloids in Sophora. The collected information suggested that a total of 99 quinolizidine alkaloids were isolated and detected from different parts of Sophora plants, represented by lupinine-type, cytisine-type, sparteine-type, and matrine-type. However, quality control needs to be monitored because it could provide basic information for the reasonable and efficient use of quinolizidine alkaloids as medicines and raw materials. The nonmedicinal parts may be promising to be used as a source of quinolizidine alkaloid raw materials and to reduce the waste of resources and environmental pollution. In addition, the diversity of chemical compounds based on the alkaloid scaffold to make a biological compound library needs to be extended, which may reduce toxicity and find new bioactivities of quinolizidine alkaloids. The bioactivities most reported are in the fields of antitumor activity along with the effects on the cardiovascular system. However, those studies rely on theoretical research, and novel drugs based on quinolizidine alkaloids are expected."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any
