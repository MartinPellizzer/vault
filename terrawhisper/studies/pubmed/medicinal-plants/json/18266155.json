Wild growing plants were harvested at vegetative, floral budding, full flowering, fresh fruiting and mature fruiting stages and dissected into stem, leaf and reproductive tissues and assayed for bioactive compounds by HPLC method. Accumulation of rutin and quercetin was not detected in plant parts of H. montbretii during plant growth. Chlorogenic acid and hyperoside content in whole plant was decreased linearly with advancing of development stages and reached their highest level at vegetative stage. On the contrary, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, quercitrin and viteksin content in whole plant increased during the course of seasonal development and the highest level of those compounds was observed at the stage of full flowering. Leaves did not produce apigenin-7-O-glucoside, while viteksin was not detectable in stem and reproductive tissues. Depending on development stages, reproductive parts had the highest level of apigenin-7-O-glucoside and leaves produced major amount of chlorogenic acid, hyperoside and viteksin whereas accumulation of quercitrin was prevailed in stem tissue. Such kind of data could be useful for elucidation of the chemotaxonomical significance of these compounds and medicinal evaluation of this species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Agronomy, University of Ondokuz Mayis, Kurupelit, Samsun, Turkey. cuneytc@omu.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cirak", "ForeName": "C\u00fcneyt", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radusiene", "ForeName": "Jolita", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arslan", "ForeName": "Burhan", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18266155", "10.1080/14786410701642623", "790537857"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
