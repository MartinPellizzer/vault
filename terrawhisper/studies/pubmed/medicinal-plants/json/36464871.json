The number of adults with diabetes increased to 537 million in 2021.", "The overarching goal of diabetic research and treatment has always been to restore insulin independence and an average blood glucose level. Chemotherapeutic antidiabetic agents can manage diabetes but often show toxicity and drug resistance. Natural phytomedicines may be useful along with stem cell therapy for diabetes management. Even if the whole pancreatic organ and islet transplantation, are becoming benchmark techniques for diabetes management and control, a considerable scarcity of eligible donors of pancreatic tissues and organs severely limits their use. Stem cell treatment provides a bunch of possibilities for treating people with diabetes.", "For this purpose, comprehensive article searching was conducted, with relevant material obtained using search engines such as Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, Google, and others, using appropriate keywords.", "Stem cell therapies, including induced pluripotent stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, are now becoming a popular area of investigation. Recent advancements in stem cell therapy might provide a feasible treatment option. Furthermore, in recent years, some novel bioactive compounds derived from plants have demonstrated antidiabetic action with higher potency than oral hypoglycaemic medications. Recent regenerative medicine and stem cell treatment advancements might subsequently provide a feasible diabetic management option. On the other hand, medicinal herbs have been considered a better choice for the extensive treatment of diabetes.", "If proper attention is not given to control diabetes by antidiabetic chemotherapeutic agents, natural phytomedicine, and sophisticated treatment like stem cell therapy, then the lifespan of patients will be decreased, and some associated secondary problems will also arise. So, the present review attempts to discuss naturopathy as an alternative resource in combination with stem cell therapy for the progressive management of diabetes and associated disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cell and Developmental Biology Special, Department of Zoology, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, 741235, India."}], "LastName": "Saha", "ForeName": "Aloke", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cytogenetics and Molecular Biology Lab., Department of Zoology, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, 741235, India."}], "LastName": "Samadder", "ForeName": "Asmita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Global Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Kashipur, 244713, India."}], "LastName": "Nandi", "ForeName": "Sisir", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Naturopathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36464871", "10.2174/1568026623666221201150933", "CTMC-EPUB-127964"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
