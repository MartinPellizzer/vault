The nutrient composition of DCBF, WF, wheat bread, and DCBF-fortified bread was studied. When DCBF fortification was increased from 0 to 20%, there was an increase of 36% in protein, 18% in fat, 123% in calcium, 52% in phosphorus and 40% in iron contents. DCBF contained greater amounts [g/16 g N] of lysine and histidine compared to WF. All essential amino acids increased when DCBF was substituted for WF from 0 to 20%, except methionine, which decreased. The biological quality of the breads was investigated. The protein efficiency ratio for 10%. DCBF bread (1.60) was found to be significantly greater (P < 0.05) than that of 5%-DCBF bread (1.48) and wheat bread (1.17)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ain Shams University, Women's College, Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, ET-Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Kader", "ForeName": "Z M", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11253637", "10.1002/1521-3803(20010101)45:1<31::AID-FOOD31>3.0.CO;2-H"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
