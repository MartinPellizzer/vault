Greater inhibition of anti-IgE-induced histamine release was achieved with feverfew compared with the inhibition of A23187-induced release. Inhibition of anti-IgE-induced histamine release by feverfew extract was observed when the drug was added simultaneously with anti-IgE and the inhibitory activity increased only slightly when the drug was preincubated with the cells for 5 min before anti-IgE stimulation. In this respect feverfew differs from cromoglycate and quercetin. Feverfew extract inhibited anti-IgE-induced histamine release to the same extent in the absence and presence of extracellular glucose. It is concluded that feverfew extract contains a novel type of mast cell inhibitor."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hayes", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Foreman", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37H9VM9WZL", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcimycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcimycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine Release"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mast Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2441022", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1987.tb03421.x"]}}]}
