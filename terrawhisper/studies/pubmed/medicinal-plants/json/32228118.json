The levels of total phenolics and flavonoids were 175\u2009\u00b1\u20092.66\u2009mg GAE/g, and 35\u2009\u00b1\u20092.88\u2009mg QE/g respectively. Moreover, HPLC analysis revealed six compounds, namely gallic, salicylic, ellagic and ferulic acids as well as catechin and quercetin. A mice model of acute liver injury was successfully established after a single intraperitoneal injection of CCl<sub>4</sub>, as evidenced by histological analysis, Masson trichrome and Sirius red staining. Compared with the CCl<sub>4</sub> intoxicated group, the <i>L. maritima</i> treatment resulted to reduce the liver serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes with further amelioration in the oxidative stress. The present findings discover the therapeutic potentials of <i>L. maritima</i> empowered with promising natural leads for the treatment of oxidative stress associated health disorders by attenuating free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and upregulating the tissue-specific antioxidant enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3837-5532"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Sciences of Gafsa, Gafsa, Tunisia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Biotechnology and Plant Improvement Laboratory, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ben Hsouna", "ForeName": "Anis", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6989-5197"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Gafsa, Gafsa, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Dhibi", "ForeName": "Sabah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Physiopathology, Alimentation and Biomolecules, PAB, LR17ES03, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of Sidi Thabet, BiotechPole of Sidi Thabet, University of Manouba, Ariana, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Dhifi", "ForeName": "Wissal", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Biotechnology and Plant Improvement Laboratory, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ben Saad", "ForeName": "Rania", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Biotechnology of Sfax, Biotechnology and Plant Improvement Laboratory, Sfax, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Brini", "ForeName": "Faical", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Gafsa, Gafsa, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Hfaidh", "ForeName": "Najla", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0867-1357"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Studies and Research of Medicinal Plants, Federal University of Vale do S\u00e3o Francisco, Petrolina, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "Jackson Roberto Guedes da Silva", "Initials": "JRGDS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8123-4743"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Arts in Balgarn, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Valorisation of Bio-GeoRessources, BVBGR, LR11ES31, Higher Institute of Biotechnology of Sidi Thabet, BiotechPole of Sidi Thabet, University of Manouba, Ariana, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Mnif", "ForeName": "Wissem", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32228118", "10.1080/01480545.2020.1742730"]}}]}
