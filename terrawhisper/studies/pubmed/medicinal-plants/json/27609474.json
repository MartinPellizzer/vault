The present study was planned to verify the in vitro antibacterial activities as well as the in vivo potential values of clove oil and ciprofloxacin against Aeromonas sobria in African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). The in vitro phenotypic virulence activities and the successful amplification of aerolysin and hemolysin genes in the precisely identified A. sobria strain were predictive for its virulence. In the in vivo assay, virulence of A. sobria strain was fully demonstrated based on constituent mRNA expression profile of tested virulence genes and typical septicemia associated with high mortalities of infected fish. Apparent lower mortality rates were correlated well with both decrescent bacterial burden and significant down-regulated transcripts of representative genes in the treated groups with clove oil, followed by ciprofloxacin as a prophylactic use for 15 days (P < 0.0001); however, the essential oil apart from ciprofloxacin significantly enhanced different hematological parameters (P < 0.05). In addition, administration of antibiotic may be considered as a pronounced stress factor in the fish even when it used in the prophylactic dose. In conclusion, medicinal plants-derived essential oils provide a virtually safer alternative to chemotherapeutics on fish, consumers and ecosystems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagazig University Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Zagazig Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Hamid", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagazig University Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Zagazig Egypt norhan_vet@hotmail.com."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Aziz", "ForeName": "N K", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagazig University Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine Zagazig Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clove Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53126-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "aerolysin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aeromonas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Toxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Catfishes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Clove Oil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Down-Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fish Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27609474"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
