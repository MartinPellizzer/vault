Among them, O. coerulescens, O. cernua and O. pycnostachya have been widely utilized in northern China for treatments of pains in the loins and knees, impotence, and spermatorrhea. However, their chemical profiles haven't been elucidated. In the present study, UHPLC-IT-TOF-MS was implemented to conduct in-depth chemome profiling of O. coerulescens, O. cernua and O. pycnostachya, aiming to achieve a comprehensive chemical characterization and to provide pronounced information for the quality control and clinical applications. An ACE Ultra-Core 2.5 Super C_(18)(3.0 mm\u00d7150 mm, 2.5 \u03bcm) column was deployed for chromatographic separations, and high-resolution MS~n spectra were recorded by IT-TOF-MS. Forty-eight components, in total, were observed, and thirty-eight ones were structurally annotated according to proposing mass fragmentation patterns, matching with relevant databases. Particularly, nine ones were confirmed by reference compounds. Overall, the chemical compositions of O. coerulescens and O. cernua are quite similar, and differences occur between O. pycnostachya and the prior two ones; primary chemical family is phenylethanoid glycosides, and several lignan glycosides as well as iridoid glycosides are also observed; the primary components include acteoside, isoacteoside, crenatoside and 2'-acetylacteoside, etc."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ke", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Xing-Cheng", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Li-Bo", "Initials": "LB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jin-Ru", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Qing-Qing", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 100029, China Beijing Key Laboratory for Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Yue-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Orobanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32726027", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200408.201"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
