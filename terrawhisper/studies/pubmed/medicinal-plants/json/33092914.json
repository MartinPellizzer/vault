Therefore, the effects of foliar spray of 100\u00a0mg/L or 500\u00a0mg/L of chitosan lactate (ChL) on the accumulation of selected phenolics and physiological parameters of basil and lemon balm were investigated. In basil, the concentration of rosmarinic acid (RA) increased after application of 100\u00a0mg/L of ChL. In turn, in lemon balm both ChL concentrations increased the accumulation of RA and anthocyanins, while the level of total phenolic compounds (TPC) was elevated only at the dose of 100\u00a0mg/L of ChL. Elicitation of basil with 500\u00a0mg/L of ChL increased the shoot biomass. Therefore, such an elicitor as ChL can enhance the accumulation of valuable phytochemicals in Lamiaceae species. This simple and non-laborious method can be used for elicitation of herbal plants in production of functional food."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
