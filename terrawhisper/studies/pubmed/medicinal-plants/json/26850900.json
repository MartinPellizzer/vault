(Oleaceae), commonly found in the Mediterranean region in Turkey, is used as medicinal teas for weight loss and hyperglycaemia in folk medicine. Objective The study investigated the possible effects of P. latifolia leaves aqueous extract's on weight loss and biochemical-histological changes in the rats fed a high-energy diet (HED), also isolated and determined the main phenolic compounds. Materials and methods Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were divided into four equal groups such as the HED group fed a HED, the PLE group given only the extract of P. latifolia leaves (220\u2009mg/kg), the HED\u2009+\u2009PLE group administrated with the extract of leaves (220\u2009mg/kg) after being fed with HED and a control group fed with standard pellet diet. Results PLE administration caused a remarkable decrement of body weight in the HED\u2009+\u2009PLE group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). PLE showed an improved effect on structural integrity and decreased leukocyte infiltration in liver and small intestinal tissues. The blood glucose (117.3\u2009mmol/L), leptin (5.6\u2009ng/mL), total cholesterol (61.8\u2009mg/dL) and LDL (9.3\u2009mmol/L) levels were significantly increased in the HED group. PLE administration in the HED group decreased these levels. The levels of HDL (26.8\u2009mmol/L) in the HED\u2009+\u2009PLE group were higher than both control and HED groups. Chemical composition was investigated and luteolin 7-O-glucoside and chlorogenic acid were determined for the first time in Turkish sample from the EtOAc extract of leaves. Discussion and conclusion Phillyrea latifolia leaves may have beneficial effects on obesity related cellular problems and may become a good source of antidiabetic medication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey ;"}], "LastName": "Yazici-Tutunis", "ForeName": "Secil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biology, Faculty of Science , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey ;"}], "LastName": "Gurel-Gurevin", "ForeName": "Ebru", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine , Bezmialem Vak\u0131f University , Bezmialem , Turkey ;"}], "LastName": "Ustunova", "ForeName": "Savas", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biology, Faculty of Science , Istanbul University , Istanbul , Turkey ;"}], "LastName": "Demirci-Tansel", "ForeName": "Cihan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacognosy and Phytopharmacy-Phytotherapy , Near East University Faculty of Pharmacy , Nicosia , TRNC - Mersin , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mericli", "ForeName": "Filiz", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98J6XDS46I", "NameOfSubstance": "luteolin-7-glucoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Obesity Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, High-Fat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oleaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Loss"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26850900", "10.3109/13880209.2015.1137952"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
