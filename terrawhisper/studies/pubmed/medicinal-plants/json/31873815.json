Ionizing radiation technology is a simple, pioneering, eco-friendly, and single step degradation process which is used in exploiting the efficiency of the natural polysaccharides as plant growth promoters. Arsenic (As) is a noxious and toxic to growth and development of medicinal plants. Artemisinin is obtained from the leaves of Artemisia annua L., which is effective in the treatment of malaria. The present study was undertaken to find out possible role of oligomers of irradiated carrageenan (IC) on two varieties viz. 'CIM-Arogya' (As-tolerant) and 'Jeevan Raksha' (As-sensitive) of A. annua exposed to As. The treatments applied were 0 (control), 40 IC (40\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> IC), 80 IC (80\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> IC), 45 As (45\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> soil As), 40 IC + 45 As (40\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> IC + 45\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> soil As), and 80 IC + 45 As (80\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> IC + 45\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> soil As). The present study was based on various parameters namely plant fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), leaf area index (LAI), leaf yield (LY), chlorophyll and carotenoid content, net photosynthetic rate (P<sub>N</sub>), stomatal conductance (G<sub>s</sub>), carbonic anhydrase activity (CA), proline content (PRO), lipid peroxidation (TBARS), endogenous ROS production (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content), catalase activity (CAT), peroxidase activity (POX), superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase activity (APX), As content, and artemisinin content in leaves. Plant growth and other physiological and biochemical parameters including enzymatic activities, photosynthetic activity, and its related pigments were negatively affected under As stress. Leaf-applied IC overcame oxidative stress generated due to As in plants by activating antioxidant machinery. Interestingly, leaf-applied IC enhanced the production (content and yield) of artemisinin under high As stress regardless of varieties. The oligomers of IC and As were found to be responsible for the production of endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which has a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of artemisinin in A. annua."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2487-1228"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology Section, Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 202002, India. naeemgaur@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Naeem", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology Section, Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 202002, India."}], "LastName": "Nabi", "ForeName": "Aarifa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology Section, Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 202002, India."}], "LastName": "Aftab", "ForeName": "Tariq", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Physiology Section, Department of Botany, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 202002, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "M Masroor A", "Initials": "MMA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "Project No. SB/FT/LS-242/2012", "Agency": "Science and Engineering Research Board, New Delhi", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Protoplasma", "NlmUniqueID": "9806853", "ISSNLinking": "0033-183X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N712M78A8G", "NameOfSubstance": "Arsenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Arsenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia annua"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31873815", "10.1007/s00709-019-01475-y", "10.1007/s00709-019-01475-y"]}}]}
