Even ancient physicians from hundreds of years ago used Cannabis sativa to treat several conditions like pain. In the modern era, the research community, including health-care providers, have witnessed wide-scale changes in cannabis policy, legislation, and marketing, with a parallel increase in patient interest. A simple search in PubMed using \"cannabis and pain\" as keywords provides more than 2,400 articles, about 80% of which were published in the last 8-10\u00a0years. Several advancements have been achieved in understanding the complex chemistry of cannabis along with its multiple pharmacological activities. Preclinical data have demonstrated evidence for the promising potential of cannabis for pain management, and the continuous rise in the prevalence of pain increases the urgency to translate this into clinical practice. Despite the large body of cannabis literature, researchers still need to find rigorous answers for the questions about the efficacy and safety of cannabis in treatment of certain disorders such as pain. In the current chapter, we seek to present a critical overview about the current knowledge on cannabis with special emphasis on pain-related disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024.
