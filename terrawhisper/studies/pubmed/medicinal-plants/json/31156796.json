However, gentamicin can induce nephrotoxicity. In this research, hydroalcoholic extract of <i>Rheum turkestanicum</i> was used against gentamicin- induced nephrotoxicity and its effect against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats has been investigated.", "The rats were placed into one of these groups: saline group, gentamicin group that received gentamicin 80 mg/kg/day for six days, and two treatment groups that received <i>R. turkestanicum</i> intraperitoneally at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight, respectively, 1 hr before gentamicin injections. Urine samples were collected at 24 hr to measure glucose and protein concentration. Blood samples were collected to determine serum urea and creatinine. One kidney was homogenized to measure malondialdehyde and thiol, and the other kidney was kept for pathological studies.", "Gentamicin increased the level of urinary glucose and protein, and increased malondialdehyde while it decreased thiol in kidney tissue, and increased the concentration of urea and creatinine in the serum. Histopathological pathology revealed renal damage following gentamicin usage; however, the extract was able to improve gentamicin toxicity.", "<i>R. turkestanicum</i> has positive effects in the attenuation of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanoudi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deparment of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroumand-Noughabi", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Basic Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101517966", "ISSNLinking": "2008-3866"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Martinez-Salgado C, L\u00f3pez-Hern\u00e1ndez FJ, L\u00f3pez-Novoa JM.
