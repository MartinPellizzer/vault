To address this, the search for new and potent antimalarial drugs is crucial. Plant-based formulations offer a promising alternative for such drug development. Here, we evaluated the in vitro antiplasmodial activity of nine plant extracts, traditionally used to treat fever-like symptoms in Bangladesh. We assessed the antimalarial activity of plant extracts by using the Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 growth inhibition assay, an invasion assay, and a cytotoxicity assay. Of the nine plants studied, ethanolic and methanolic leaf extracts of Ficus hispida, Streblus asper, and Boerhavia repens exhibited high antiplasmodial activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.31, 4.13, 9.63\u202f\u03bcg/ml (ethanolic) and 15.12, 6.63, 7.58\u202f\u03bcg/ml (methanolic), respectively, and minimal toxicity (cell viability >80%). Clerodendrum viscosum displayed antiplasmodial effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 28.90\u202f\u03bcg/ml (ethanolic) and 30.57\u202f\u03bcg/ml (methanolic). Adhatoda vasica, Mussaenda corymbosa, and Amaranthus spinosus ethanolic extracts showed antimalarial effects with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 61.78\u202f\u03bcg/ml, 66.31\u202f\u03bcg/ml, and 64.14\u202f\u03bcg/ml, respectively. However, methanolic extracts of A. vasica and A. spinosus had IC<sub>50</sub> values >100\u202f\u03bcg/ml. The ethanolic and methanolic extracts of A. vasica, A. spinosus, F. hispida, S. asper, and B. repens significantly reduced parasitemia by inhibiting invasion into erythrocytes. This study highlights the robust antimalarial activity and low cytotoxicity of leaf extracts of F. hispida, S. asper, and B. repens, indicating the presence of antimalarial compounds that warrant further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
