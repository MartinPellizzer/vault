Many of the medicinal plants and herbs are also part of our diet as spices, vegetables and fruits. In recent years, there is growing evidence that plant-foods molecules, due to their biological properties, may be unique nutraceuticals and supplementary treatments for various aspects of Diabetes mellitus. In this review, we addressed the potential efficacies of S-Allylcysteine (SAC), a sulfur containing amino acid, derived from garlic, on Diabetes mellitus and other disorders. Substantiate with several in vitro, animal models and some human studies, SAC revise carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, alter hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, recuperate adipose tissue metabolism, and improve oxidative stress and stress-sensitive signaling pathways and inflammatory processes. In Conclusion, S-Allycysteine showed several beneficial effects on various disorders and there is no scientific evidence against S-Allycysteine adverse effects, and proved that consumption of S-Allylcysteine has numerous pharmacological benefits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sathibabu Uddandrao", "ForeName": "V V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brahmanaidu", "ForeName": "Parim", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, K.S.
