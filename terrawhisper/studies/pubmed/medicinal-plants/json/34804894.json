This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of a polyherbal compound (PHC, formulated as syrup) consisting of <i>Allium sativum</i>, <i>Curcuma longa</i>, <i>Panax ginseng</i>, and <i>Camellia sinensis</i> on the quality of life (QOL) and survival in patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers.", "A randomized placebo-controlled trial was carried out on patients with esophageal or gastric cancer who had finished their oncological treatments. The patients were randomly assigned to PHC (n=20) or placebo (n=20) group. The PHC group was treated with the PHC for 12 weeks, while the placebo group received 70% sucrose syrup. The QOL was assessed at baseline\u00a0and\u00a0after 12 weeks. The patients were followed for up to 24 months to determine overall survival.", "PHC significantly improved cancer-related symptoms, physical performance, and psychological and social functions of the patients (p<0.05 for all cases). Death occurred in 33 and 22% of cases in the placebo and PHC group, respectively. The mean survival time was 16.8 months (95% CI: 12.8-20.9) in the placebo group and 21.4 months (95% CI: 19.1-23.6) in the PHC group but the difference was not statistically significant.", "The PHC improved cancer-related symptoms, physical performance, and psychological and social functions in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.
