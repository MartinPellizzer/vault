A series of allosteric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists was identified previously with the aid of HPLC-based activity profiling, whereby activity was tracked with an electrophysiological assay in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To accelerate the discovery process, an approach has been established for HPLC-based profiling using a larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) seizure model induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a pro-convulsant GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist. The assay was validated with the aid of representative GABAergic plant compounds and extracts. Various parameters that are relevant for the quality of results obtained, including PTZ concentration, the number of larvae, the incubation time, and the data analysis protocol, were optimized. The assay was then translated into an HPLC profiling protocol, and active compounds were tracked in extracts of Valeriana officinalis and Magnolia officinalis. For selected compounds the effects in the zebrafish larvae model were compared with data from in silico blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability predictions, to validate the use for discovery of BBB-permeable natural products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moradi-Afrapoli", "ForeName": "Fahimeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University , G.
