A possible alternative to ameliorate Al toxicity is the application of such organic manure as crop straw and animal manure. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of organic materials on the alleviation of Al toxicity in acid red soil. Ground wheat straw, pig manure or CaCO3 were mixed with the soil and incubated, at 85% of water holding capacity and 25 degrees C, for 8 weeks. After the incubation, 14 seedlings of mung bean (Phaseolus aures Roxb) were allowed to grow for 12 days. Results showed that application of organic material or CaCO3 increased soil pH and decreased soil monomeric inorganic Al concentrations. Growth of mung bean seedling was improved sustantially by the application of organic material or CaCO3. Pig manure or wheat straw was more effective in ameliorating Al toxicity than was CaCO3. Mung bean plants receiving pig manure or wheat straw contained relatively high concentrations of P, Ca and K in their leaves. It is suggested that the beneficial effect of organic manure on mung bean is likely due to decreasing concentrations of monomeric inorganic Al concentrations in soil solution and improvement of mineral nutrition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Sciences and MOA Key Laboratory of Crop Growth Regulation, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Q R", "Initials": "QR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Z G", "Initials": "ZG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Bioresour Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "9889523", "ISSNLinking": "0960-8524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H0G9379FGK", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Carbonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Carbonate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Organic Chemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11198175", "10.1016/s0960-8524(00)00109-7", "S0960-8524(00)00109-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
