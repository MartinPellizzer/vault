Their structures were established by spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configurations were established by ECD calculations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction crystallography. The isolated compounds were tested for their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antitumor activities. Most of the compounds showed potent anti-inflammatory activities. Among them, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-\u03b2-ionone (8), oleanolic acid (17) and acetylpleamolic acid (18) showed strong anti-inflammatory activity against IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Several compounds showed moderate inhibitory activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Escherichia coli. And (4S)-p-menth-l-ene-7,8-diol 8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (16) showed antitumor activities against MCF-8 and HT-29 cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 93.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.69 and 71.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.94\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Oleanolic acid (17) showed moderate antitumor activity against HT-29 cell lines with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 52.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.63\u00a0\u03bcM. In this study, the discovery of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antitumor components from H. cuspidatus could benefit further development and utilization of this plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
