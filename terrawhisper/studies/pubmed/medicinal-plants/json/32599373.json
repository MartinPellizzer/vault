Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic methods and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Structural variations mainly occurred at the attachment of C-3 and the carbon residues linked to C-17. 21-deoxo-23-oxofebrifugin A and 3-O-detigloyl-3-O-isobutyryl-21-deoxo-23-oxofebrifugin A are two rare naturally occurring mexicanolide-type limonoids bearing an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated-\u03b3-lactone motif at C-17. Moreover, cipaferen R is the first degraded tetranortriterpenoid derivative featuring an unique acetyl group at C-17. Some isolated compounds were evaluated for nematicidal, antifungal, cytotoxic (against five human cancer cell lines), and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. No nematicidal and antifungal activities were observed, yet 3-O-detigloyl-3-O-isobutyrylfebrifugin A, febrifugin A, febrifugin, and khaysin T exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against the tested cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 18.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27 to 38.00\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85\u00a0\u03bcM, and 3-O-detigloyl-3-O-isobutyrylfebrifugin A, granatumin E, khaysin T, and 2'S-cipadesin A showed moderate inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at 50\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
