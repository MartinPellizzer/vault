Using molecular methods, seven endophytic fungal strains from the medicinal plants Copaifera pubiflora and Melocactus ernestii were identified as Diaporthe miriciae, while two isolates were identified to the genus level (Diaporthe sp.). All crude extracts of Diaporthe species produced via solid-state fermentation were evaluated by <sup>1</sup>H NMR analyses. Crude extracts of the isolates D. miriciae UFMGCB 6350, 7719, 7646, 7653, 7701, 7772, and 7770 and Diaporthe sp. UFMGCB 7696 and 7720 were demonstrated to produce highly functionalized compounds. The extracts of D. miriciae UFMGCB 7719 and 6350 were selected as representative Diaporthe samples and subjected to bioassay-directed fractionation to isolate cytochalasins H and J. Cytochalasins H and J were evaluated for activities against the fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum fragariae, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Phomopsis obscurans, and Phomopsis viticola using microdilution broth assays. Cytochalasins H and J exhibited the most potent activities against the Phomopsis species tested. Our results showed that Diaporthe species were potential producers of different cytochalasins, which exhibit potential for controlling fungal diseases in planta and (or) maintaining antagonism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biological Science, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, P.O.
