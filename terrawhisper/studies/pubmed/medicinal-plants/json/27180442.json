Active cream carrying 2% extract of Ananas comosus in the internal phase of w/o emulsion was prepared while placebo contained no extract. Stability assessment of both creams was performed at various storage conditions 8, 25, 40 degrees C, 40 degrees C + 75% RH (relative humidity) and 50 degrees C. Effects on epidermal hydration and TEWL were observed by applying active cream at one side and placebo on the other side of face by 11 healthy human volunteers during 12 weeks period using Corneometer MPA5 and Tewameter MPA5. Results indicated that both creams (active and placebo) remained stable at all storage conditions. All samples manifested non-Newtonian, shear thinning behavior with increasing shear rate, whereas statistical interpretation indicated that effects of active cream were superior than placebo, as it significantly (p = 0.05) improves the epidermal hydration levels up to 56.74% and reduces TEWL up to -73.19% at the end of study period compared to baseline value. The surface evaluation of living skin (SELS) parameters SEr, SEsc, SEsm, SEw were also assessed and indicated a significant (p = 0.05) reduction. Conclusively, creams loaded with Ananas comosus extract exhibit better physicochemical stability and represent a propitious improvement in skin barrier function, used as a functional moisturizing and anti-aging ingredient in topical skincare products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Atif I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shoaib H M", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ananas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Storage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Healthy Volunteers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Cream"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Loss, Insensible"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27180442"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
