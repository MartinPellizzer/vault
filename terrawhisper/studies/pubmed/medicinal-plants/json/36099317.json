Kaempferol, (3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one), is a kind of naturally occurring flavonoid existing in many common fruits and vegetables (e.g., onions, broccoli, strawberries and grapes) and particularly in traditional Chinese medicine as exemplified by <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>. Epidemiological, preclinical and clinical studies have revealed an inverse association between the consumption of kaempferol-containing foods and medicines and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Numerous translational studies in experimental animal models and cultured cells have demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities of kaempferol. In this article, we reviewed the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardio-protective activities of kaempferol and elucidated the potential molecular basis of the therapeutic capacity of kaempferol by focusing on its anti-atherosclerotic effects. Overall, the review presents the health benefits of kaempferol-containing plants and medicines and reflects on the potential of kaempferol as a possible drug candidate to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, the underlying pathology of most cardiovascular diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Clinical Research Hospital of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Hefei), University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Meijie", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3311-770X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry and Food Science, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jianbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2519-6690"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacognosy Group, Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Research Center for Food Nutrition and Safety, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}], "LastName": "El-Seedi", "ForeName": "Hesham R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9313-5929"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Products Chemistry, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Wo\u017aniak", "ForeName": "Krystyna Skalicka", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4870-7713"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "International Research Center for Food Nutrition and Safety, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Napoli Federico II, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Daglia", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Queensland, Pharmacy Australia Centre of Excellence, Woolloongabba, QLD, Australia."}], "LastName": "Little", "ForeName": "Peter J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7889-1697"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Clinical Research Hospital of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Hefei), University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5488-5217"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Institute of Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, Clinical Research Hospital of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Hefei), University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Suowen", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36099317", "10.1080/10408398.2022.2121261"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
