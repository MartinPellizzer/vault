The current investigation focused on the efficacy of the essential phytocompounds identified in <i>Anvillea radiata</i> to target the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-COV-2 through molecular docking and dynamic analyses; in addition to the safety assessment of this herb <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. <i>In silico</i>, the 6LU7 structure of M<sup>pro</sup> was prepared as a target by Discovery Studio 2020. The virtual screening of phytocompounds from <i>Anvillea radiata</i> was performed through iGEMDOCK program, followed by an evaluation of the potential inhibitors based on the docking scores calculated using AutoDock Vina and MGL Tools programs, as well as complexes stability assessment through MD simulation. <i>In vivo</i> toxicity studies of <i>Anvillea radiata</i> aqueous extract were also conducted in Wistar rats. Among the phytocompounds evaluated in this study, 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, Spinacetin, 9\u03b1-Epoxyparthenolide, Hispidulin, Quercetin, jaceosidin, Nepetin, and isorhamnetin were predicted to have the highest binding affinity for the Main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) target of SARS-CoV-2. The aqueous extract of <i>Anvillea radiata</i> did not induce any signs of toxicity. 3,5-Dicaffeoylquinic acid, Spinacetin, 9\u03b1-Epoxyparthenolide, jaceosidin, and isorhamnetin from <i>Anvillea radiata</i> were selected as potential inhibitors of SARS-Cov-2 to develop new drugs anti-COVID-19."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Team of Ethnopharmacology and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Akdad", "ForeName": "Mourad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Moujane", "ForeName": "Soumia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Team of Ethnopharmacology and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bouadid", "ForeName": "Ismail", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry of Natural Substances, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques, Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Benlyas", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Team of Ethnopharmacology and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Sciences and Techniques Errachidia, Moulay Ismail University of Meknes, Errachidia, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Eddouks", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health A Tox Hazard Subst Environ Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "9812551", "ISSNLinking": "1093-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34978275", "10.1080/10934529.2021.2020029"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
