These studies showed that plants have potential in increasing in the osseointegration once their components may downregulate biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1, Metalloproteinase 2, and 3. They may also upregulate mediators such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Transforming-Growing Factor-\u03b21, Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and type 1 collagen. The control in the production of these cytokines may help bone regeneration. Plant components such as curcumol, caffeic acid, resveratrol, luteolin, and many others may also be useful in bone health once may interfere in Nuclear Factor-\u03baB and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases, and may modulate Ca2+ signaling, inflammatory mediator genes, and inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.", "Many plants possess components that are effective in promoting bone regeneration and new pharmaceutical technology and pharmacological researchers should be performed in order to establish the dose and the appropriate delivery vehicle of administration of the plant or its compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barbalho", "ForeName": "Sandra Maria", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ara\u00fajo", "ForeName": "Adriano Cressoni", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Penteado Detregiachi", "ForeName": "Cl\u00e1udia Rucco", "Initials": "CR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buchaim", "ForeName": "Daniela Vieira", "Initials": "DV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guiguer", "ForeName": "\u00c9len Landgraf", "Initials": "\u00c9L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Altern Ther Health Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9502013", "ISSNLinking": "1078-6791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31202209"]}}]}
