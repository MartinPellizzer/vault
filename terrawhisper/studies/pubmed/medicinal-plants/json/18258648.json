Most of the documented examples of acute toxicity caused by botanical dietary supplements have been caused by the substitution of toxic plants for the desired species, probably through misidentification or production errors, or by contamination with pharmaceutical agents, either as a result of poor manufacturing practices or adulteration. Although more difficult to document, chronic toxicities attributed to botanical dietary supplements may be caused by contamination by heavy metals, pesticides, or microbes or by inherent properties of constituents of the botanicals themselves. Like drug-drug interactions, botanical-drug interactions can also be a source of toxicity. Most of these toxicity problems may be prevented by implementing good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices and applying existing toxicity testing similar to those used in drug development or new toxicity assays under development based on proteomics, genomics, or metabolomics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Illinois at Chicago/National Institutes of Health Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, L 60612, USA. breemen@uic.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Breemen", "ForeName": "Richard B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "Harry Hs", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Farnsworth", "ForeName": "Norman R", "Initials": "NR"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P50 AT00155", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18258648", "10.1093/ajcn/87.2.509S", "S0002-9165(23)23470-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
