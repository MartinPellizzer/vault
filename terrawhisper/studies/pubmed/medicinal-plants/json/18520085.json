Alongside of this RH analysis, a simultaneous determination of salidroside (SA), tyrosol (TY), and gallic acid (GA) was carried out. Rhodiola plants are a popularly used ethnodrug from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau of China. The identity of RH was unambiguously determined based on the quasimolecular ions in negative ESI-MS mode. This method was validated in respect to sensitivity, linearity, precision, repeatability and recovery using optimized chromatographic conditions. The linear calibration curve was acquired with R(2)>0.999, and the limit of detection (S/N=3) was estimated to be 43.75 microg/g. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the intra- and inter-day precisions were 0.75% and 0.50%, respectively. The repeatability was evaluated by a replicated analysis of samples with the RSD value found within 0.67%. The recovery rates varied within the range of 98.79-100.08% with RSD less than 1.10%. In the present study, the content of RH was quantified within 0.4192-4.7260 mg/g for 16 batches of R. crenulata. It was also found in eight other species plants. The results demonstrated that RH is a useful characteristic standard compound for quality evaluation and chemical differentiation among species of Rhodiola. The study also indicated that the analytical procedure is precise, reproducible and a potential tool for both quality assessment and species identification."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West China School of Pharmacy, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "889FQ29409", "NameOfSubstance": "rhodionin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calibration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Online Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18520085", "10.1248/cpb.56.807", "JST.JSTAGE/cpb/56.807"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
