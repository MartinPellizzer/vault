Among the treatments include Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) and drug treatment. Even this ESWL treatment may cause acute renal injury, decrease in renal function and increase in stone recurrence. In addition, persistent residual stone fragments and possibility of infection after ESWL represent a serious problem in the treatment of stones. Data from in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical trials reveal that phytotherapeutic agents could be useful as either alternative or an adjunct therapy in the management of Urolithiasis. Medicinal plants /natural products are more acceptable to the body because they promote the repair mechanism in natural way. Various plant species of the genus Bergenia, have been reported to posses antiurolithiatic property. Bergenia ligulata (Wall.) Engl, is one the ingredient of reputed herbal formulation Cy stone for the treatment of kidney stones. In this study alcohol, butanol, ethyl acetate extracts and isolated phenolic compounds from the Ayurvedic and Unani herb, Bergenia ciliata (Haw.) Sternb. leaves (Saxifragaceae) were evaluated for their potential to dissolve experimentally prepared kidney stones-calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, by an in-vitro model. Phenolic compound P(1) isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of the leaves, demonstrated highest dissolution of both stones when compared to test extracts at 10 mg concentration. However, it was more effective in dissolving calcium phosphate stones (67.74 %) than oxalate (36.95%). Reference standard-formulation Cystone was found to be more effective (48.48%) when compared to compound P(1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of PG studies and Research in Industrial Chemistry, Kuvempu University, Karnataka, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Byahatti", "ForeName": "Vivek V", "Initials": "VV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pai", "ForeName": "K Vasantkumar", "Initials": "KV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D'Souza", "ForeName": "Marina G", "Initials": "MG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557418", "PMC3336267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
