After chromatography on phenyl Sepharose, the fraction with uncoating activity was enriched in a doublet of 70-kD peptides. Using chromatofocusing, it was possible to produce fractions enriched in the upper component of the doublet of 70-kD peptides; these fractions still retained ATP-dependent uncoating activity. In western blot analysis, antibodies against a member of the 70-kD family of heat-shock proteins interacted with the upper component of the doublet of the 70-kD peptides from the phenyl Sepharose-purified fractions. On the basis of these data, it appears that the uncoating ATPase may be a member of the 70-kD family of heat-shock proteins. The uncoating activity removed clathrin from both pea and bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles. The uncoating ATPase from bovine brain also uncoated coated vesicles from peas. Pea clathrin-coated vesicles that were prepared by three different methods were uncoated to different extents by the plant uncoating ATPase. Different populations of clathrin-coated vesicles from the same preparation showed differential sensitivity to the uncoating ATPase. Limited proteolysis of the clathrin light chains in the protein coat abolished the susceptibility of the clathrin-coated vesicles to the uncoating ATPase. The properties of the uncoating ATPase isolated from developing pea cotyledons are similar to those of uncoating ATPases previously described from mammalian and yeast systems. It appears that despite dissimilarities in composition of the clathrin components of the vesicles from the respective sources, uncoating is achieved by a common mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, University of Oklahoma, Norman 73019."}], "LastName": "Kirsch", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beevers", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Clathrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Centrifugation, Density Gradient"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Clathrin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HSC70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1982 Oct;79(19):5881-5", "ArticleIdList": ["6964393"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Sep;76(9):4350-4", "ArticleIdList": ["388439"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Cell. 1986 Apr 11;45(1):3-13", "ArticleIdList": ["2937542"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1988 Sep 6;27(18):6806-13", "ArticleIdList": ["2904276"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Cell Biol. 1985;1:1-39", "ArticleIdList": ["2881559"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1990 Apr 25;265(12):6682-7", "ArticleIdList": ["1969864"]}, {"Citation": "J Cell Biol. 1984 Aug;99(2):723-33", "ArticleIdList": ["6146630"]}, {"Citation": "J Cell Biol. 1984 Aug;99(2):734-41", "ArticleIdList": ["6146631"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1986 Jun;155(2):243-8", "ArticleIdList": ["3728976"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1983 Nov 10;258(21):13347-52", "ArticleIdList": ["6138357"]}, {"Citation": "Methods Enzymol. 1990;182:663-70", "ArticleIdList": ["2314261"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8208846", "PMC158964", "10.1104/pp.103.1.205", "103/1/205"]}}]}
