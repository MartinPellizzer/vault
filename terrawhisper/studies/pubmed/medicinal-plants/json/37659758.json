Across numerous communities, plants have served as diuretic agents, leveraging their abundant phytochemical composition. In certain instances, plant-based remedies have gained preference over synthetic drugs due to their affordability and ready availability. Hedyotis scandens Roxb., commonly recognized as Laikingtuibur/Kelhnamtur in Mizoram, belongs to the Rubiaceae family. This plant has been harnessed worldwide within diverse societies as a medicinal resource to combat a spectrum of ailments. Notably, in Mizoram, the leaves are employed in creating a decoction with diuretic properties. The ethnopharmacological exploration of plant diuretics not only preserves cultural traditions but also contribute to the potential discovery of novel therapeutic agents.", "Our study endeavours to explore the traditional employment of this plant as a diuretic in Mizoram. Furthermore, we seek to elucidate the plant's chemical composition through the utilization of GC-MS analysis.", "In this investigation, we conducted plant extraction using methanol and distilled water as solvents within a soxhlet apparatus. Prior to commencing the main experiment, we conducted an acute toxicity test to ensure the safety of the plant extract. For the assessment of diuretic activity, we adopted the methodology outlined by Lipschitz et al. (1943). All in vivo experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines set forth by the OECD. Based on the outcomes of the acute toxicity evaluation, we opted for three dosage levels: a high dose (1000\u00a0mg/kg), a medium dose (500\u00a0mg/kg), and a low dose (250\u00a0mg/kg). Furosemide, recognized as a loop diuretic, was employed as the standard reference, while the control group received distilled water.", "Our investigation unveiled the presence of several uncharacterized bioactive compounds within the plant. Of particular interest, the GC-MS analysis identified a specific compound named 'phytol,' which has previously been associated with diuretic properties. Notably, the acute toxicity assessment demonstrated the plant extract's safety even at a high dose of 5000\u00a0mg/kg, as no toxic effects were observed. The diuretic evaluation of the H. scandens extract exhibited a dose-dependent increase in diuresis, with the methanolic extract yielding notably superior outcomes compared to the aqueous extract. Moreover, the treated animals displayed an elevated output of electrolytes and an enhanced glomerular filtration rate in comparison to the control group. Notably, the histological examination of the kidneys from the treated animals depicted a normal structural configuration, devoid of any cellular-level modifications attributed to the plant extract across all tested doses.", "The Hedyotis scandens extract demonstrated a pronounced diuretic effect in contrast to the control group. As such, our study substantiates the traditional employment of this plant as a diuretic within the Mizoram region."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
