The intervention group received Nika vaginal cream once a day for a week and those in the control group were given Clotrimazole vaginal cream in the same way. The clinical symptoms were studied by clinical examinations and the culture of vaginal discharge before and 7 days after the treatment to confirm the diagnosis of <i>Candida albicans</i>. The results were analyzed by SPSS 21.0 using an independent <i>t</i> test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and McNemar's tests, the significance level was set at 0.05.", "Most patients in both groups reported no clinical symptoms after the intervention, and no significant difference was observed between the two groups in this regard (\u03c7<sup>2</sup> = 2.23, <i>p</i> = 0.566).
