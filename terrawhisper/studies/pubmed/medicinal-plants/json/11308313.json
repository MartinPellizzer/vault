Chicoric acid was the main phenolic in E. purpurea roots (mean 2.27% summer, 1.68% autumn) and tops (2.02% summer, 0.52% autumn), and echinacoside was the main phenolic in E. angustifolia (1.04%) and E. pallida roots (0.34%). Caftaric acid was the other main phenolic compound in E. purpurea roots (0.40% summer, 0.35% autumn) and tops (0.82% summer, 0.18% autumn), and cynarin was a characteristic component of E. angustifolia roots (0.12%). Enzymatic browning during extraction could reduce the measured levels of phenolic compounds by >50%. Colorimetric analyses for total phenolics correlated well with the HPLC results for E. purpurea and E. angustifolia, but the colorimetric method gave higher values."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Crop & Food Research, Plant Extracts Research Unit, Chemistry Department, University of Otago, P.O.
