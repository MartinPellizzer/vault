It has been shown that such solutions, formed in the presence of small amounts of water and alcohol as plasticizers, are sufficiently stable under ambient conditions to enable enzymatic transformations of substrates. A partial phase diagram for a system consisting of glucose, water, and (poly)ethylene glycol was constructed to identify the regions which are most suitable for biotransformations. It was confirmed that the glass transition in this system occurred below the reaction temperature at any given composition of the constituent components. Several glycosidases were found to be catalytically active in this medium and the activity of beta-glucosidase from almond was determined at several compositions of the reaction mixture and related to the corresponding regions of the phase diagram. The synthetic utility of the system was illustrated by glucosylation of several alpha,omega-alkyldiols, short-chain polyethylene glycols, and hydroxyalkyl and glyceryl monoacrylates."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Macromolecular Sciences, Institute of Food Research, Earley Gate, Whiteknights Road, Reading RG6 6BZ, UK."}], "LastName": "Millqvist-Fureby", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gill", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vulfson", "ForeName": "E N", "Initials": "EN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Bioeng", "NlmUniqueID": "7502021", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3592"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.23", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Galactosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Mannosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.26", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Fructofuranosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus oryzae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mannosidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Mannosidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta-Fructofuranosidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Galactosidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10099420", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19981020)60:2<190::AID-BIT6>3.0.CO;2-I"]}}]}
