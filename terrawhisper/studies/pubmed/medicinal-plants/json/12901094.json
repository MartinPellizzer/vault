About 3,000 outstanding Biantiao ginseng roots were selected and planted in breeding field, and self-crossed for four generations. During the course, inferior lines or plants were rejected. Then strain comparison, identification of resistance to black-speck disease, and analysis of active compositions were carried out.", "\"Biantiao 1\" (BT1), the first new variety of Biantiao ginseng, with green stems and thick, long, elegant roots and median resistance to black-speck disease, has been harvested since 20 years. The percentage of Biantiao ginseng roots and yield were 15% and 30% higher than the control's respectively. The content of total ginsenosides and the main monomers was 1.8%-2.5% higher than the control's. The characteristics of overground part and root of BT1 were uniform and stable.", "BT1, a new excellent ginseng variety, has a good potential value to be generalized in ginseng production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cultivation, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, CAMS, PUMC, Beijing 100094, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Z X", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "X J", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "L H", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "X J", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "8006230", "ISSNLinking": "1000-503X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12901094"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
