While no significant effects were seen on either egg numbers or egg size, feed intake increased and the efficiency of feed utilization decreased with increasing inclusion of the foliage. Absolute initial and final body weights did not show significant treatment differences but live weight changes over the course of the experiments were statistically significant, weight gains decreasing with increasing calliandra levels. The strength of colour of the yolks increased within 3 days of offering the calliandra, irrespective of the level of inclusion. The persistence of the colour change after withdrawal of the leaf meal ranged from 3 days at the 5% inclusion to over 10 days at the 10% level. While it may be possible to include calliandra leaf meal in poultry rations along with other, local, low-cost components, there would appear to be little advantage in using it in conjunction with commercial layers meal at levels higher than those necessary to provide the desired pigmentation level in the yolks (5% or less)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Agroforestry Research Project, KARI Regional Research Centre, Embu, Kenya."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paterson", "ForeName": "R T", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roothaert", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kiruiro", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Trop Anim Health Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "1277355", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4747"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Eggs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pigmentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10717943", "10.1023/a:1005293019581"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
