Thirty six mice were inoculated with sarcocarcinoma 180 according to the standard method, Sorbaria sorbifolia ethyl acetate etract was administrated for 10 days, tumor and body weight, the activities of NK cell and the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-2 in serum were detected.", "Three compounds were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract and identified as 5,2',4'-trihydroxy-6,7,5'-trimethoxyflavone(I), succinic acid(II) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid(III). The tumor of the test groups were lighter than that of control group(P < 0.05). There was no remarkable difference between the control and test groups in body weight (P > 0.05).
