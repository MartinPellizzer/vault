In this study, methods for determining the ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (EBDC) subclass, and their degradation product ethylenethiourea (ETU) were validated by UHPLC-MS/MS in different types of dry herbs, which can be used as food and/or medicinal purposes. Mancozeb was used in the validation of the EBDC method, where it was initially complexed with EDTA, derivatized, extracted with dimethyl sulfate in acetonitrile, magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>), and sodium chloride (NaCl), and then purified using primary secondary amine (PSA). In the ETU method, L-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate was added to the samples before extraction with acetonitrile, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and NaCl, followed by purification with PSA. A pesticide-free blend of seven herbs (boldo, artichoke, \"espinheira-santa\", cat's claw, senna, chamomile, and cascara buckthorn) comprising distinct parts of the plants (leaves, bark, flowers and/or stems) was used as a control for method validation. Recoveries ranged from 79 to 113% for EBDC and 81 to 109% for ETU. Repeatability and intermediate precision were <20% for both methods. The limit of quantification was 0.03 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for EBDC (0.02 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of CS<sub>2</sub>) and ETU. The limit of detection (LOD) was set at 1/3 of the LOQ (0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for both analytes). In total, 103 samples of 33 different dry herbs were analyzed, of which 19.4% were positive for EBDC (\u2265LOD), but no ETU residues were found in any of the analyzed samples. Given the absence of registered dithiocarbamates for use in the investigated herbs in Brazil, the positive results suggest potential illegal pesticide use or cross-contamination, especially considering the low concentrations detected in most samples. Although exposure to EBDC through the consumption of medicinal herbs from positive samples did not indicate a health risk to consumers, these plants must be monitored to prevent illicit pesticide usage, particularly when the herbs are intended for therapeutic purposes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4422-5554"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Bras\u00edlia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, 70910-900, Bras\u00edlia, Federal District, Brazil. eloisa@unb.br."}], "LastName": "Mello", "ForeName": "Denise Carvalho", "Initials": "DC"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7197-6807"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Toxicology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Bras\u00edlia, Campus Darcy Ribeiro, 70910-900, Bras\u00edlia, Federal District, Brazil. eloisa@unb.br."}], "LastName": "Caldas", "ForeName": "Eloisa Dutra", "Initials": "ED"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "24FOJ4N18S", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenebis(dithiocarbamates)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenethiourea"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenebis(dithiocarbamates)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38910531", "10.1039/d4ay00597j"]}}]}
