Previous work developed a novel Vif inhibitor 2-amino-N-(2-methoxyphenyl)-6-((4-nitrophenyl)thio)benzamide (1) with strong antiviral activity. Through optimizations on the two side branches, a series of compound 1 derivatives (2-18) were designed, synthesized and tested in vitro for their antiviral activities. The biological results showed that compound 5 and 16 inhibited the virus replication efficiently with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 9.81 and 4.62\u202f\u03bcM. Meanwhile, low cytotoxicities on H9 cells were observed for the generated compounds by the MTT assay. The structure-activity relationship of compound 1 was preliminarily clarified, which gave rise to the development of more potent Vif inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
