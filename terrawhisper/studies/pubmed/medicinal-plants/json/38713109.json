With accelerating gene therapy development and approval, their environment risk assessment (ERA) becomes increasingly important. An ERA is an assessment of the risks to human health and the environment upon exposure to a medicinal product as the result of its release during clinical development or after entering the market. Because ERA is an important component of regulatory submission, drug developers must perform a robust assessment to ensure the safety of unintended persons, animal, plants, microorganisms and environment at large. Global regulations on gene therapy ERA continue to evolve. Gene therapy ERAs are carried out according to general principles as provided in regulatory guidelines for application of clinical trials and marketing authorizations. The current review intends to summarize regulations and content requirements on gene therapy ERA in European Union, the USA and Japan. The approved gene therapy products by EMA and US Food and Drug Administration are analyzed for the critical aspects of their ERAs to provide the current status and practice of gene therapy ERAs by drug developers. For this purpose, the main contents of these gene therapy ERAs are summarized. Critical safety factors of gene therapy ERAs are described. With more experience and knowledge to be accumulated, gene therapy ERAs are expected to be less challenging with commonly used viral vectors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy.
