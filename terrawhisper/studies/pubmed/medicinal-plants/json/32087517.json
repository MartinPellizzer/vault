The bioactivity of several noteworthy species has been well-documented in scientific literature, but with nearly seventy-five species, there remains much to explore in this genus. This review aims to discuss all the bioactivity-related studies of Tradescantia plants and the compounds discovered, including their anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. Gaps in knowledge will also be identified for future research opportunities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
