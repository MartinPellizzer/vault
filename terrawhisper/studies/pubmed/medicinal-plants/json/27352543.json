Based on the entrapment efficiency (EE) of ginsenoside Rg1 and ginsenoside Rb1, the effects of formulated quantity of sodium deoxycholate and cholesterol, the relative ion strength and pH value of hydration liquid were investigated. The formulation of PNS transfersomes were optimized by single-factor experiment and uniform design experiment. The in vitro characteristics of the optimized transfersomes were evaluated.", "The optimum formulation were as follows: egg phospholipid 0.45 g, cholesterol 0.05 g,vitamin E 0.01 g, sodium deoxycholate 0.119 g, PNS 0.1 g,10 mL of hydration liquid with pH at 4.75 (a mixture of 0.1 mol/L citric acid solution and 0.2 mol/L disodium orthophosphate solution, which corresponded to appropriate ion strength). The optimized PNS transfersomes had an average size of (121.8 \u00b1 3.9) nm with a PDI of 0.136 \u00b1 0.007 and a Zeta potential of (-8. 24 \u00b1 0. 63) mV.
