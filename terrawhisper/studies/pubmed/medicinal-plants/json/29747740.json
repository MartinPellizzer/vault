The IFN-\u03b3 gene expression index, IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 and IL-10/IL-4 gene expression ratio were significantly increased due to the high concentration (90\u202f\u00b5M) of auraptene treatment compared to control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05-0.001). In PHA stimulation, all three concentrations of the extract significantly decreased proliferation, cytokines (IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3) and NF-\u03baB level as well as NO production, but IFN-\u03b3/IL-4 and IL-10/IL-4 ratio were significantly increased compared control group (P\u202f<\u202f0.05-0.001).
