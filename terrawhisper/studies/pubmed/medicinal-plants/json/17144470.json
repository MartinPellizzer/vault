An LC-MS method was developed to measure the concentration of Danshensu in cell culture medium and calculate the apparent permeability coefficients (P(app)). The effects of time, drug concentration and inhibitor on the absorption of Danshensu were studied.", "Transport of Danshensu was time and concentration dependent, and it was also effected by P-glycoprotein inhibitor. P(app) increased with time increase and tended to become saturated at some point. It, however,decreased while concentration of Danshensu increased. P(ratio) is larger than 1.5 .
