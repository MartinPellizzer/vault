The basal serum gastrin concentration in conscious rats was not affected by 400 mg/kg. p.o. of FM100, but was increased by 800 mg/kg, p.o. of FM100. The serum gastrin concentration of rats in which the antrum had been separated from the fundus was decreased by intraduodenal administration of FM100 in a dose-dependent manner. In conscious beagles, the increase in serum gastrin concentration induced by feeding was not affected by pretreatment with 400 mg/kg p.o. of FM100. However, in anesthetized dogs in which the antrum had been separated from the fundus, the increase in acid output and serum gastrin concentration after administration of peptone solution was prevented by the intraduodenal administration of 200 mg/kg of FM100. These results suggest that the gastric anti-secretory action of FM100 may be due to the inhibition of endogenous gastrin release."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishii", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fujii", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gastrins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11114-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "FM 100"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Fundus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Pyloric Antrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7087261", "10.1254/jjp.32.23"]}}]}
