The present study found that phloridzin highly accumulated in <i>Malus rockii</i> Rehder. The content of phloridzin in <i>M.\u00a0rockii</i> was the highest among wild plants, with the percentage of 15.54% in the dry leaves. The structure of phloridzin was revised by proton exchange experiments and extensive 2D NMR spectra. Phloridzin exhibited significant hypolipidemic activity in golden Syrian hamsters maybe by increasing the expression of CYP7A1, at the doses of 50\u2009mg/kg and 200\u2009mg/kg. The total performance of anti-hyperlipidemic effect of phloridzin may be superior to that of lovastatin, though lovastatin was more active than phloridzin. In addition, phloridzin exhibited moderate antimalarial activity with inhibition ratio of 31.3\u2009\u00b1\u200910.9% at a dose of 25\u2009mg/kg/day, and showed moderate analgesic activity with 28.0% inhibition at a dose of 50\u2009mg/kg."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
