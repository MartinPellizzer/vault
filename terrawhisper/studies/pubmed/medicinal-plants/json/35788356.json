There is currently no cure for RA. It is however managed using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, often with severe side effects. Hidden within Africa's lush vegetation are plants with diverse medicinal properties including anti-RA potentials. This paper reviews the scientific literature for medicinal plants, growing in Africa, with reported anti-RA activities and identifies the most abundant phytochemicals deserving research attention. A search of relevant published scientific literature, using the major search engines, such as Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc. was conducted to identify medicinal plants, growing in Africa, with anti-RA potentials.", "Twenty plants belonging to 17 families were identified. The plants are rich in phytochemicals, predominantly quercetin, rutin, catechin, kaempferol, etc., known to affect some pathways relevant in RA initiation and progression, and therefore useful in its management.", "Targeted research is needed to unlock the potentials of medicinal plants by developing easy-to-use technologies for preparing medicines from them. Research attention should focus on how best to exploit the major phytochemicals identified in this review for the development of anti-RA 'green pharmaceuticals'."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
