Affinity chromatography using a human serum albumin (HSA) stationary phase was applied to separate and analyze the bioactive compounds from Artemisia capillaris Thunb. Five major peaks and several minor peaks were resolved based on their affinity to HSA, two of them were identified as scoparone (SCO, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin) and capillarisin (CAP). CAP shows a much higher affinity to HSA than SCO. The effects of acetonitrile concentration, eluent pH, phosphate concentration and temperature on the retention behaviors of several major active components were also investigated, and it was found that hydrophobicity and eluent pH play major roles in changing retention values. The results demonstrate that the affinity chromatography with a HSA stationary phase is an effective way for analyzing and screening biologically active compounds in traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Chromatographic R&A Centre, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, The Chinese Academy of Sciences."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ni", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetonitriles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z072SB282N", "NameOfSubstance": "acetonitrile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetonitriles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmolar Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10722108", "10.1016/s0021-9673(99)01062-6", "S0021-9673(99)01062-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
