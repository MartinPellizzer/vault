Based on our results, <i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i> purified extract (EAPE), sesame oil, and sea buckthorn oil were selected for the development of the sunscreen formulation. The developed sunscreen formulations containing different concentration of EAPE were evaluated for their different physicochemical properties and stability.", "The results of the phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in all tested extracts. EAPE, sesame oil, and sea buckthorn oil showed the highest absorption in the ultraviolet region. The sun protection factor (SPF) value of the developed formulations containing different concentration of EAPE was in the range of 6.37\u00b10.14 to 21.05\u00b10.85. The sunscreen formulation containing 6% EAPE was stable for 8 weeks in an oven (40 \u00b0C) and refrigerator (4 \u00b0C).", "The findings of this study revealed a higher sun protection capacity of EAPE than the other plant extracts. Sunscreen formulations containing 6% EAPE showed promising SPF values.
