China is at the centre of demand for P. polyphylla where it is used as an ingredient in several very successful Chinese medicinal herbal formulations. The Chinese e-commerce platform 'alibaba.com', for example, lists 97\u202fP. polyphylla items offered by 46 Asian suppliers, of which 21 are situated in the Chinese mainland, 12 in Nepal, 7 in India, 2 in Pakistan, and 1 each in Bhutan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam. Products offered include the crude drug (dried whole or cut rhizomes), extracts and formulations containing this herbal drug.", "The aims of this review were to assess the scale of the P. polyphylla trade, reviewing evidence on the impacts of wild harvest on P. polyphylla populations and on the role of cultivation as an alternative to wild harvest.", "Firstly, we reviewed published information on Paris population biology and studies on impacts of wild P. polyphylla harvest from across the geographic range of this species. Secondly, global trade data for P. polyphylla were analysed. Thirdly, we reviewed published information on P. polyphylla cultivation and made field visits to P. polyphylla cultivation areas in Yunnan and Sichuan.", "Since the 1980s, there has been a 400-fold increase in the market price paid in China for P. polyphylla rhizomes, from 2.7 Chinese Yuan (CNY) per kg in the 1980s to market prices up to 1100 CNY per kg in 2017. Cross-border trade in dried P. polyphylla rhizomes occurs at three different scales. Firstly, an internal, national trade of P. polyphylla rhizomes within countries (such as India, Nepal and China). Secondly, trade in P. polyphylla rhizomes from Nepal (and possibly from Bhutan) to the two range states that have the largest traditional medicine trade in the world: China and India. Thirdly, trade in processed herbal products. In China, for example, P. polyphylla is widely used as an ingredient in several very successful herbal products, including a famous first aid treatment to stop bleeding. Some of these products are exported globally, in addition to entering into regional trade. Trade data in our review shows that c. 800-1050\u202ft of P. polyphylla rhizomes are sold annually, significantly more than recorded in earlier studies. China is the only country where P. polyphylla is cultivated on a significant scale, although small-scale cultivation is taking place in India and Nepal.", "Based on the criteria for the inclusion of species in CITES Appendix II (Art. IV 2(a)), there is compelling evidence for adding Paris polyphylla. At the same time, cultivation of P. polyphylla outside of high conservation value habitats needs to be encouraged and supported. One way of doing this may be to develop separate, traceable supply chains for cultivated supplies in order to distinguish them from wild harvested stocks."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018.
