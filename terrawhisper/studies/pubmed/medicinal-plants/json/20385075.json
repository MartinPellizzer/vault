It has already been shown that some herbs (Melissa Officinalis, Cynara scolymus) can have favorable effects on digestion. The principal aim of this study is to determine whether the ingestion of \"Gran Soleil\" dessert, with or without herbs, after meals can be beneficial to health in subjects suffering from functional dyspepsia. For this purpose, thirty subjects with functional dyspepsia were enrolled and were asked to consume \"Gran Soleil\" with or without herbs; these subjects reported the course of their symptoms on VAS scale, during the basal period and after the ingestion \"Gran Soleil\" with and without herbs. It has been shown that the ingestion of \"Gran Soleil\" without herbs can induce a reduction both in the number of events connected to a dyspeptic syndrome and in their intensity; moreover the assumption of \"Gran Soleil\" with the addition of herbs helped to intensify this effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Internal Medicine, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. ggasbarrini@rm.unicatt.it"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gasbarrini", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zaccone", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Covino", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gallo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Regul Homeost Agents", "NlmUniqueID": "8809253", "ISSNLinking": "0393-974X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cynara scolymus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dyspepsia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melissa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20385075", "10"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
