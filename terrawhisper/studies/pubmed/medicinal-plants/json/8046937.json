The suitability of certain of these drugs is still to be established. Cauvery-100 is an ayurvedic formulation consisting of plant ingredients, and has been suggested to be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In the present study this drug was tested for its antiulcerogenic effect. The number of lesions on gastric mucosa decreased markedly after 15 days oral treatment with Cauvery-100 in rats with indomethacin-induced ulcers. The volume and total acidity of the gastric juice also decreased in the treated rats. The hexose, hexosamine and sialic acid levels of gastric contents, which were increased in untreated rats returned to near normal levels after 15 days of treatment. Protein in the gastric juice was elevated in untreated rats but returned to near normal levels after 15 days of treatment. Cauvery-100 acts both to decrease the acidity and to increase the mucosal defence in the gastric areas, thereby justifying its use as an antiulcerogenic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Madras, India."}], "LastName": "Manonmani", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "William", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Subramanian", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Govindasamy", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cauvery-100"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexosamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexoses"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sialic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GZP2782OP0", "NameOfSubstance": "N-Acetylneuraminic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "XXE1CET956", "NameOfSubstance": "Indomethacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidiarrheals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Juice"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexosamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hexoses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indomethacin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "N-Acetylneuraminic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sialic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8046937", "10.1016/0378-8741(94)90015-9", "0378-8741(94)90015-9"]}}]}
