Therefore, DGAT and ACAT have been viewed as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases. From the screening program for DGAT inhibitors, new compounds were discovered from fungal and plant extracts, and are expected to provide leads for drug development. From the screening programs for ACAT inhibitors and lipid droplet synthesis inhibitors, new compounds with chemical structures different from those of known synthetic inhibitors were discovered from the cultures of fungal and actinomycete strains. Among them, fungal beauveriolide III rather selectively inhibited ACAT1 isozyme, while fungal pyripyropene A was found to be a highly selective inhibitor of ACAT2 isozyme. Both inhibitors proved orally active in in vivo models. Furthermore, a library of beauveriolide and pyripyropene analogs was prepared by combinatorial and semisynthetic methods, respectively. The future prospects of these inhibitors are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Kitasato University, Tokyo, Japan. tomodah@pharm.kitasato-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomoda", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Omura", "ForeName": "Satoshi", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "7905840", "ISSNLinking": "0163-7258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.26", "NameOfSubstance": "Sterol O-Acyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Actinobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Sterol O-Acyltransferase"}], "NumberOfReferences": "95"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17614133", "10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.05.008", "S0163-7258(07)00103-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
