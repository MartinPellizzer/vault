The present study aimed to investigate the potential of linagliptin, a potent/selective DPP-4 inhibitor with marked anti-inflammatory actions, to attenuate trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-evoked colitis in rats; an experimental model of IBD, and the implicated molecular mechanisms. This may add to the clinical utility of linagliptin for the management of patients with coexisting IBD and diabetes mellitus. Notably, no former studies have linked JAK2/STAT3, HMGB1/NF-\u03baB, and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling in TNBS-evoked colitis.", "Western blotting and ELISA were used to determine the levels of target signals.", "Administration of linagliptin (1.5\u00a0mg/kg; p.o.) mitigated the colitis severity via diminishing the disease activity index, colon weight/length ratio, and macroscopic scores. Linagliptin also lowered the colonic histologic scores and leukocyte invasion. Notably, linagliptin inhibited the colonic DPP-4 activity and upregulated the expression of intestinotrophic GLP-2 without incurring hypoglycemia in animals. Linagliptin curbed inflammation through the suppression of colonic IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and myeloperoxidase and upregulation of IL-10. It also inhibited the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway via downregulating p-JAK2/JAK2 and p-STAT3/STAT3 protein expression and HMGB1/RAGE/NF-\u03baB cascade through lowering HMGB1, RAGE, and p-NF-\u03baB p65/NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression. In the context of mucosal oxidative stress, linagliptin diminished lipid peroxides and augmented GSH, GPx, and total antioxidant capacity. It also activated Nrf2/HO-1 pathway via upregulating Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression.", "Linagliptin shows a promise for the management of IBD via targeting IL-6/JAK2/STAT3, HMGB1/RAGE/NF-\u03baB, and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
