For 14 days, ewes in each of 4 groups (N = 40/group) were given supplements of lupin grain or formaldehyde-treated casein and/or wheat starch. These were calculated to supply equivalent amounts of protein post-ruminally and/or digestible energy. Supplementation with lupin grain significantly increased ovulation rate by 37% by increasing the proportion of ewes with two ovulations. Similar increases in ovulation rate were achieved by increasing the supply of digestible protein post-ruminally in the casein and casein + starch-supplement groups. Increasing the intake of digestible energy separately in the starch-supplement group did not increase ovulation rate. It is concluded that increases in ovulation rate in ewes fed a lupin supplement are the result of significant increases in the amount of protein digested post-ruminally."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Waite Agricultural Research Institute, University of Adelaide, Glen Osmond, South Australia."}], "LastName": "Nottle", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hynd", "ForeName": "P I", "Initials": "PI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seamark", "ForeName": "R F", "Initials": "RF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Setchell", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Reprod Fertil", "NlmUniqueID": "0376367", "ISSNLinking": "0022-4251"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3199375", "10.1530/jrf.0.0840563"]}}]}
