Wendl) wine (RPW) is a natural beverage obtained from the R. hookeri consumed for refreshment and medicinal purposes. For medicinal purposes, it is used singly or as macerating agent for other medicinal plants for the treatment of several diseases.", "This study investigates the effect of Raffia palm wine on dysregulated lipid metabolic pathways in testicular tissues of type 2 diabetic (T2D) rats.", "Raffia palm wine (150 and 300\u00a0mg/kg bodyweight) was administered to two T2D groups respectively, another T2D group was not administered treatment and served as negative control, while metformin served as the standard drug. After 6 weeks of treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the testes collected. After weighing, the organs were homogenized in 20% methanol/ethanol and centrifuged at 20,000\u00a0g to extract the lipid metabolites.", "GC-MS analysis of the supernatants revealed an alteration of the metabolites on induction of T2D, with concomitant generation of 10 metabolites. Raffia palm wine inhibited the T2D-generated metabolites while replenishing cholesterol and squalene levels, with concomitant generation of 7 and 8 metabolites for low and high dose treatment respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis of the metabolites revealed a decreased level of steroid biosynthesis and increased level of fatty acid biosynthesis. Raffia palm wine inactivated glycerolipid, fatty acid, and arachidonic acid metabolisms, fatty acid biosynthesis and fatty acid elongation in mitochondria pathways, and activated pathways for plasmalogen synthesis, mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain saturated fatty acids.", "The replenishment and generation of these metabolites and additional ones as well as activation of pathways involved in energy generation, phospholipids, antioxidant activity, steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis suggest a therapeutic effect of Raffia palm wine against hyperglycemic-induced testicular dysfunction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
