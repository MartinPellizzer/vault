Yellow lupines and field bean plants were supplied with N2 from the air considerably better than white lupines and peas after inoculation with the most effective Rhizobium strains. Application of mineral N to the white lupines and peas not only substituted the inhibited N2-fixation, but increased N amounts in the plants. White lupines fixed more N2 under soil conditions than in quartz sand. An experiment with steam-sterilized and 15-labelled soil as a comparative substrate showed, that this finding was mainly caused by an additional Rhizobium infection from the soil. Contrary to field beans and yellow lupines which fix N2 up to ripeness, white lupines and peas finished N2-fixation in the time of flowering. Mineral-N applied at that time was an additional source of N for last-named plants and they utilized it for production of higher protein yields. Continual spraying of white lupine plants with 14C-labelled sucrose solution after the time of flowering caused continuance of N2-fixation up to the stage of ripeness. It is assumed that the cause of this effect was the competition of growing seeds and nodules for the photosynthates. The supply of nodules was inadequate without external sucrose application. Mineral N inhibited the sucrose-induced N2-fixation of white lupine nodules and their consumption of photosynthates. Consequently, the applied 14C was transported into seeds to a larger extent. The investigations allow the following conclusion: Effective N2-fixation requires nodules being a powerful sink for assimilates on the basis of a highly efficient photosynthetic system of the host plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Merbach", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schilling", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Wirksamkeit der symbiontischen N2-Fixierung der K\u00f6rnerleguminosen in Abh\u00e4ngigkeit von Rhizobienimpfung, Substrat, N-D\u00fcngung und 14C-Saccharoselieferung."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Zentralbl Bakteriol Naturwiss", "NlmUniqueID": "8000422", "ISSNLinking": "0323-6056"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symbiosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6252716"]}}]}
