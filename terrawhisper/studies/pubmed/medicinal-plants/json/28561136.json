Emphasis will be put on those issues that attracted the most attention or even went through paradigmatic changes since the turn of the millennium. PubMed and Google Scholar were used (\"<i>Digitalis</i>\" and \"Foxglove\" were the key words) to identify research from 2000 till 2017 containing data relevant enough to be presented here. Intriguing new results emerged from studies related to the phylogeny and taxonomy of the genus as well as to the biosynthesis and potential medicinal uses of the key active compounds, the cardiac glycosides. Several Eastern and Western Foxgloves were studied with respect to their propagation <i>in vitro.</i> In this context, molecular biology tools were applied and phytochemical analyses were conducted. Structure elucidation and analytical methods, which have experienced less exciting progress, will not be considered here in great detail."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl Pharmazeutische Biologie, Department Biology, FAU Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Kreis", "ForeName": "Wolfgang", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "Conflict of Interest: The author declares to have no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28561136", "10.1055/s-0043-111240"]}}]}
