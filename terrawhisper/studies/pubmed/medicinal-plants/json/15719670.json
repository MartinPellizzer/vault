In these years, PVA has been applied wider and wider in medicine industry. In the study of modem preparations of TCM PVA, as film material of membrane and pellicles, is very promising owing to its easy forming and excellent toughness. PVA is good polymer matrix for suppositories and gel, because it can not only carry drug but also improve the properties of preparations on application and technology. It can be said that PVA is an excellent carrier. At the present, PVA is mainly applied in vitro preparations of TCM, but its applications will be spread with further research. The prospective applications of PVA in osmotic pump controlled release preparations, drug carried microspheres and swelling controlled release system are foreseen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, 300072, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yun-hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jian-chen", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-89-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyl Alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyl Alcohol"}], "NumberOfReferences": "17"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15719670"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
