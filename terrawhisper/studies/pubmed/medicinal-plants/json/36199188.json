The particularities of five published and analysed Croatian books of folk recipes from the 17 th and 18 th century are examined. Recipes with drugs of herbal and animal origin, which are most often mentioned in Croatian books of folk recipes, and which were available in folk medicine at the time, are compared with those from Dioscorides' work. Many herbal drugs described in books of folk recipes are today used in contemporary phytotherapy, and modern biomedical research reveals new bioactive substances and confirms new and potential biological activities in medicinal plants used in folk medicine, which is the basis for further study of <i>De materia medica</i> by Dioscorides and ethnomedicinal collections. Croatian books of folk recipes are a valuable resource for multidisciplinary study, including for medicinal and pharmaceutical historians, philologists and ethnologists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Zagreb, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Croatia;, Email: sinic@pharma.hr."}], "LastName": "Ini\u0107", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Zagreb, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Ga\u0161parac", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Books"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Croatia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36199188", "10.1691/ph.2022.2027"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
