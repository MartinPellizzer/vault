Showing Leaf Yellows Symptoms in China.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Peony (<i>Paeonia suffruticosa</i> Andr.), belonging to family Paeoniaceae, is an important medicinal and ornamental plant. During August of each year from 2016 to 2023, peony plants at Heze city were found to exhibit leaf yellows symptoms. The incidence rate of the symptomatic plant was recorded from 10% to 30% in four peony gardens with about 200 acres. Total DNA was extracted from 0.10 g fresh plant leaf tissues from 24 symptomatic and 8 asymptomatic samples using rapid plant genomic DNA isolation kit (Aidlab Biotechnology, Beijing, China). The extracted DNA was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction using universal primers R16mF2/R16mR1 followed by R16F2/R16R2 (Lee et al., 1993; Gundersen and Lee, 1996) specific for the 16S rRNA gene and new designed <i>tuf</i> gene specific primers JWB-tuforfF1 (5'-ATGGCTGAAATATTTTCAAGAG-3') and JWB-tuforfR1 (5'-TTATTCTATGATTTTAATAACAG-3') followed by JWB-tuforfF2 (5'-ATGTAAACGTAGGAACTATTGG-3') and JWB-tuforfR2 (5'- TCCGATAGTTCTTCCACCTTCAC-3'). Amplicons of about 1.25 kb and 1.02 kb (16S rRNA gene and <i>tuf</i> gene, respectively) were obtained in 8 symptomatic samples from four peony gardens. However, no amplification was obtained in any of the asymptomatic samples. The representative amplicons of 16S rRNA and <i>tuf</i> genes of three positive samples (Heze-9, -18 and -27) were cloned into a zero background pLB-simple vector (Tiangen Biotechnology, Beijing, China) and sequenced by Taihe Biotechnology, Beijing, China. Sequences obtained in the study were deposited in NCBI GenBank with accession numbers PP504882, PP504883 and PP504884 for the 16S rRNA gene as well as PP530237, PP530238 and PP530239 for the <i>tuf</i> gene. The phytoplasma strain under the study was described as peony yellows (PeY) phytoplasma, PeY-Heze strain. Alignment analysis by DNAMAN software showed that three 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained in the study shared 99.36% to 99.60% sequence identity and three <i>tuf</i> gene sequences obtained in the study were identical. BLAST analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the PeY-Heze phytoplasma strains showed 99.60%-99.84% sequence identity with '<i>Candidatus</i> Phytoplasma ziziphi' (GenBank accession: CP025121). And <i>tuf</i> sequences of the strains showed 100% similarity with '<i>Ca</i>. P. ziziphi' (CP025121). Interestingly, the virtual RFLP patterns derived from three 16Sr RNA gene sequences obtained in the study by iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al., 2009) were different from the reference patterns of all previously established 16Sr groups/subgroups. The most similar are the reference pattern of the 16Sr group VII, subgroup E (AY741531), with a similarity coefficient of 0.72, which is less than 0.85. These phytoplasma strains may represent a new 16Sr group. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA genes using MEGA 7.0 by neighbor-joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap value indicated that PeY-Heze strains clustered into one clade with the phytoplasma strains of '<i>Ca</i>. P. ziziphi' with 68% bootstrap value. Although there are several reports available on '<i>Ca</i>. P. solani' infecting peony in Shandong Province, China (Gao et al., 2013). To our knowledge, this is the first report of '<i>Ca</i>. P. ziziphi'-related strains infecting peony in China. The findings in this study will be beneficial to the detection, quarantine, and prevention of peony yellows phytoplasmas in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heze University, Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Heze, Shandong, China; 18265083938@sohu.com."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Chuan-Sheng", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Coconut Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, Plant protection center, Coconut Research Institute, Wenqing Avenue 496, Wenchang 571339, Hainan province, People's Republic of China, Wenchang, China, 571339; hzuyss@163.com."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Shao-Shuai", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heze University, Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Heze, Shandong, China; wcp423@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Cui-Ping", "Initials": "CP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heze University, Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Heze, Shandong, China; 624999490@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Qing-Zhong", "Initials": "QZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heze University, Department of Agriculture and Forestry, Heze, Shandong, China; hzuwjg@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jun-Gang", "Initials": "JG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39051994", "10.1094/PDIS-04-24-0773-PDN"]}}]}
