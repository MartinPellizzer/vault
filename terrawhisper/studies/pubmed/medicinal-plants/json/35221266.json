This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of BST in cold restraint stress-induced gastric ulcers. Male Sprague Dawley rats were orally treated with various doses of BST including 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18g/kg based on the human daily intake dose. After treatment once per day for 3 days, rats were restrained into the cold stress chamber for 12h at 4\u00b0C to induce gastric ulcers. Gastric hemorrhagic ulcer area was evaluated and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone, epinephrine and dopamine levels were determined. Compared to cold stress-induced gastric ulcer rats, hemorrhage ulcer areas were reduced in BST-treated stomach tissues at all concentrations. Increased serum ACTH, corticosterone and epinephrine levels were significantly decreased by BST treatment in cold stress-induced gastric ulcer rats. Moreover, there were increments of serum dopamine levels in 3 and 6g/kg of BST-treated groups. Taken together, BST positively ameliorated cold restraint stress-induced gastric hemorrhage with decrease in serum stress-related biomarkers such as ACTH, corticosterone, epinephrine and dopamine. The 3-6-fold of human daily intake dose of BST exhibited protective effects as a herbal medicine for gastric ulcers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Convergence Korean Medical Science, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Mi Hye", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Korean Medicine, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sun Haeng", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Korean Medicine Development, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "Do Young", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Korean Medicine Development, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Yun Bum", "Initials": "YB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute for Korean Medicine Development, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ham", "ForeName": "Sung Ho", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Convergence Korean Medical Science, College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Woong Mo", "Initials": "WM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Republic of Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35221266"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
