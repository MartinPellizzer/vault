Cases were patients detected with fibrous bands and leathery mucosa and hospital-based controls were matched by age and sex. Information on habits was collected by personal interview of 157 cases and 157 controls. Despite overall female preponderance, a substantial number of young men were enlisted. The male/female risks were found to be similar. Immigrants from India to Pakistan (Mohajir) had a similar risk status to local Punjabis. No differences between risks were found when comparing the three age categories, 21, 21-40, 41-60 yr. Among the cases, an increased risk was observed for areca nut chewing. This habit when practised alone appeared to have the highest risk (RR 154), followed by pan with or without tobacco (RR 64, 32 respectively). Logistic regression and discriminant analysis showed that daily consumption rates appeared to be more important with respect to risk than lifetime duration of habit. Tobacco habits were more prevalent amongst those 15 cases who presented with concurrent carcinoma and OSF: We conclude that areca nut chewing has a causal relationship with OSF: additional tobacco insult may be necessary for subsequent carcinoma development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Maher", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Warnakulasuriya", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lewis", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "N W", "Initials": "NW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Discriminant Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Submucous Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8164155", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.1994.tb00258.x"]}}]}
