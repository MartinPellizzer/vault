Wats in a liquid medium containing Murashige and Skoog (1962) basal salts, vitamins, 100 mg 1<sup>-1</sup> myo-inositol and 20 g l<sup>-1</sup> of sucrose (MS) that was supplemented with 13.6 \u03bcM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.15 \u03bcM kinetin. An initial inoculum density of 2 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup>exhibited optimum cell growth. Calli were obtained 12-15 days after the suspension was plated onto semisolid medium of a similar composition. When calli were transferred to semisolid regeneration medium containing MS + 6.7 \u03bcM N <sup>6</sup>-benzyl-adenine + 1.15 \u03bcM kinetin, somatic embryogenesis and plantlet regeneration occurred after 10-25 days. There was no significant decrease in the regeneration potential of the calli even when the cultures were initiated from 47-week-old cell suspensions. Chromosome counts of cells in suspensions, calli and somatic embryos derived from cultures of different ages revealed the presence of diploids, tetraploids and octaploids. However, the 33 regenerated plants tested were all diploid, indicating that only diploid cells were capable of regeneration in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Division, Regional Research Laboratory, 751013, Bhubaneswar, India."}], "LastName": "Patnaik", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Division, Regional Research Laboratory, 751013, Bhubaneswar, India."}], "LastName": "Sahoo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Division, Regional Research Laboratory, 751013, Bhubaneswar, India."}], "LastName": "Debata", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1990 May;8(12):714-7", "ArticleIdList": ["24232924"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Cell Rep. 1989 Dec;8(8):483-5", "ArticleIdList": ["24233534"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1988 Apr 8;240(4849):204-7", "ArticleIdList": ["2832947"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30727656", "10.1007/BF01146788", "10.1007/BF01146788"]}}]}
