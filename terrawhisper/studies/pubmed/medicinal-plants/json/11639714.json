Then, Japanese valerianae was widely used as the same effective drug as European valerianae in the Meiji period. By the beginning of the First World War, Japanese government encouraged the use of domestic drugs in Japan. As a result, Japanese valerianae was widely grown all over Japan and became the majority of the circulation on the market. Japanese valerianae contained more volatile oil than European valerianae. Therefore, Japanese valelrianae was exported mainly to Germany until the Second World War and was highly evaluated from all over the world. After the Second World War, Japanese valerianae lost its economical advantage and the production of Japanese valerianae declined. Now, Japanese valerianae was barely grown only in Hokkaido. The pharmaceutical action of Japanese valerianae is generous. So, it is thought that valerianae radix may be used for raw materials of general drugs in the future, too."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Japanese Society of History of Pharmacy."}], "LastName": "Yanagisawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsumoto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Psychotropic Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Commerce"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacopoeias as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Psychotropic Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11639714"]}}]}
