Dietary treatment consisted of either rice, beans, and vegetable oil (group RB, n = 25) or rice, soy-protein isolate, corn syrup solids, and vegetable oil (group RS, n = 21), each given in amounts up to 150 kcal/kg body weight per day immediately following rehydration therapy. The groups were generally similar at the time of admission, and there were no differences in the rates of treatment failure (8% in group RB, 14% in group RS; P = .65). Mean stool outputs were 83 +/- 46 (SD) g/kg body weight in group RB and 71 +/- 43 g/kg body weight in group RS on day 1, and these outputs consistently ranged from 25% to 40% greater in group RB than in group RS (P = .058). By contrast, the median duration of liquid stool excretion was substantially less in group RB than in group RS (60 vs 121 hours, P = .01). The fractional absorption of carbohydrate, fat, and total energy was significantly greater by children in group RS, but there were no differences in net apparent absorption of these nutrients because the children in group RB consumed significantly more of their assigned diet. Children in group RS gained significantly more weight during the whole period of observation (194 g vs 1 g, P = .047), but these differences could be entirely explained by the weight (and presumably fluid) changes on day 1. There were no consistent differences by dietary group in any of the other anthropometric indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Salud del Ni\u00f1o, Lima, Peru."}], "LastName": "Alarcon", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Montoya", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rivera", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perez", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peerson", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pediatrics", "NlmUniqueID": "0376422", "ISSNLinking": "0031-4005"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea, Infantile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peru"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1614781"]}}]}
