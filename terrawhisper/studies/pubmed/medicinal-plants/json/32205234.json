Among the most common pathological conditions connected with excessive adiposity are hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension which result in chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD) such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and nonalchoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The contribution of inflammatory-immune reactions in obesity and its related co-morbidities is unequivocal. Increased levels of free fatty acids (FFA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) overloads the homeostatic system resulting in pro-inflammatory adipokines secretion, immune-activation and chronic inflammation in obesity. The cellular mechanisms of defense against oxidative stress are orchestrated by the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2). Excessive oxidative stress in the cell activates NRF2 which upregulates genes encoding major cytoprotective enzymes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO1), and glutathione S-transferases (GST). The present review aims to clarify the interconnections between chronic inflammation, oxidative overload and NRF2-mediated cytoprotection as potential therapeutic approach in obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
