Dysregulation of these functions usually leads to liver diseases and further related complications. The incidence of liver diseases is increasing worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality when at advanced stages, and has become significant public health concern and substential economic burden. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies for managing liver diseases progression are urgently required. T. ruticarpum is one of the most famous and frequently used herbal medicine and has been prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas for the treatment of various ailments, including liver diseases. A considerable amount of bioactive ingredients have been isolated and identified from the roots of T. ruticarpum, including alkaloids, saponins, phenols, volatile oils and other compounds. Among these compounds, evodiamine (EVO) and rutaecarpine (RUT) are believed to be the most bioactive compounds.", "To summarize recent findings regarding to the metabolism, pharmacological/toxicological effects of EVO and RUT and to highlight the potential therapeutic effects of them against liver diseases.", "Online academic databases (including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and CNKI) were searched using search terms of \"T. ruticarpum\", \"Wu Zhu Yu\", \"evodiamine\", \"rutaecarpine\", \"liver\" and combinations to include published studies of EVO and RUT primarily from 2004-2019. Several critical previous studies beyond this period were also included.", "Evodiamine (EVO) and rutaecarpine (RUT) are believed to be the most bioactive alkaloids in T. ruticarpum, having anti-inflammation, anti-fibrosis, anti-lipotoxicity, anti-cancer activities, and thus having potential to improve liver disorders. In the current review, we comprehensively summarized recent progresses in the studies of EVO- and RUT-mediated promising hepatoprotective effects and also provide novel insights regarding the potential use of EVO and RUT as therapeutic options for the treatment of liver diseases.", "With further in-depth pharmacology and pharmacokinetic studies, we believe that natural products in T. ruticarpum and their derivatives will become promising medicines with improved clinical efficacy for the treatment of liver diseases in the immediate future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
