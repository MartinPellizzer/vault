Chemo-preventive potential was evaluated in-vivo in Methylnitrosourea (MNU) induced mammary cancer in nulliparous Sprague-Dawley rats. The mechanism for anticancer potential was screened by in-vitro studies involving Annexin V- FITC assay (apoptosis), Chick Chorioallantoic Membrane assay (angiogenesis) and Migration assay (metastasis). Statistical analysis was done by one way and two way ANOVA (for Growth Rate and feed consumption efficiency) followed by post hoc Bonferroni's test with P value < 0.05.", "It is observed that the exposure of MEBM, at various concentrations and time intervals to different cell lines, resulted in decreased cell proliferation. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of MCF-7 cells was found significantly less than that of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 cells, which indicated that the extract of said medicinal plant were more potent inhibitors of estrogen positive breast cancer cells than other types of breast cancer cells in vitro. Corroborative evidences were acquired in MNU actuated mammary carcinogenesis where MEBM constricted tumor parameters, decreased expression of estrogen and progesterone, nucleic acid content and increased latency period. MEBM also induced apoptosis, inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis in-vitro.", "Selective cytotoxic activity in MCF-7 estrogen positive breast cancer cells and inhibition of growth of mammary carcinoma in-vivo by methanol extract of Butea monosperma flowers (MEBM) suggests chemo-prevention through modulation of estrogen and progesterone receptor, apoptotic, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastatic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
