However, the herb medicines used in this experiment showed neither an inhibitory effect on the growth of cancer cells nor prevention of inhibitory effect of 5-FU on the growth of cancer cells. 5-FU in combination with various kinds of herb medicine prolonged the survival time of tumor bearing mice. 5-FU in combination with shosaiko-toh was most effective; its increase of life span (ILS) was by 56%. However, mitomycin C in combination with shosaiko-toh was not associated with the prolongation of the survival rate of tumor bearing mice. The long-term administration of 5-FU to rats resulted in decrease in body weight, food intake, and white blood cell count, and these symptoms were improved when 5-FU was used in combination with shosaiko-toh. However, the increase in A/G ratio due to a decrease in the serum globulin fraction and marked atrophy of the thymus were not improved even when shosaiko-toh was combined with 5-FU."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohta", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tawara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tatsuka", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Odashima", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Gan To Kagaku Ryoho", "NlmUniqueID": "7810034", "ISSNLinking": "0385-0684"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "shosaiko-to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U3P01618RT", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorouracil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorouracil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6411005"]}}]}
