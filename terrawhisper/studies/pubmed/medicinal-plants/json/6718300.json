Pure theobromine was added to diets to furnish the same levels as furnished by 1, 2, 4, and 6% dietary cocoa shell meal, which contained, by analysis, 1.3% theobromine. Approximately 1% jimson meal is the upper dietary limit that can be safely incorporated into the diet of young broilers. Dietary levels of 3 and 6% from 1 to 21 days of age drastically depressed performance. Cocoa shell meal that contained 1.3% theobromine was somewhat less toxic to chicks than jimson meal. However, performance tended to be depressed with dietary levels above 1%. Pure theobromine was a little more toxic than that furnished by cocoa shell meal."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Day", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dilworth", "ForeName": "B C", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OBD445WZ5P", "NameOfSubstance": "Theobromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cacao"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Datura stramonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depression, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Theobromine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6718300", "10.3382/ps.0630466", "S0032-5791(19)35870-5"]}}]}
