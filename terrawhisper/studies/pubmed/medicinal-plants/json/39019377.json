By utilizing a double emulsion technique, the size of the nanocomposites was significantly reduced through the application of almond oil; the inclusion of span 80 further improved their uniformity. The physiochemical properties of the nanocomposite were thoroughly examined by Fourier Transformed Infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential tests. The verification of the uniform particle distribution was achieved by employing FE-SEM and VSM analyses. The average diameter of the particles was 223\u00a0nm, and their zeta potential was -47.6\u00a0mV. In addition, the nanocomposite exhibited a regulated release of 5-Fu at pH\u00a05.4 and pH\u00a07.4, as indicated by an in vitro drug release profile. PEG-AGA- Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@5-Fu exhibited biocompatibility, as indicated by the lack of deleterious effects observed in tumor cells. This revolutionary nanocomposite demonstrates exceptional promise for breast cancer treatment, underscoring its significance as a major advancement in the pursuit of novel nanotechnologies for cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
