It may be due to glucose intolerance by the tissues and inadequate insulin production from pancreatic \u03b2- cells. However, diabetic complication includes cardiovascular and kidney diseases, eye, skin, and foot complications, and neuropathy. The intention behind writing this article was to gather recent information regarding the use of ancient traditional medicinal plants having recent importance in treating diabetes. Several therapies are available for curing the condition based on severity and type of diabetes. Although pharmacological treatments are effective and economical, drugs are associated with unwanted side effects and physiological complications on long-term use. Interestingly, herbs and herbal plants have been used since ancient times against diabetes worldwide. Its importance still exists due to medicinal plants' effectiveness and safety profile in treating various diseases. In this article, we searched online databases, including PUBMED, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and traditional resources, for collecting information regarding the use of plants against diabetes. We described the pathophysiology of the disease and incorporated plant sources and their chemical constituents responsible for antidiabetic activity with their mechanism in reducing blood glucose levels. The present article may be very helpful for researchers and professionals whose work is inclined towards diabetes and in search of lead compounds for the development of a suitable drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Academy, IFTM University, Moradabad 244102, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Nanda", "ForeName": "Jyoti", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinologist Hygia Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Lucknow 226620, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Neeraj", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Academy, IFTM University, Moradabad 244102, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Mani", "ForeName": "Munesh", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Diabetes Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101253260", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3998"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "23", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36567295", "10.2174/1573399819666221222155055", "CDR-EPUB-128394"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
