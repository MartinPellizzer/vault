However, the recalcitrant coloured compounds have not yet been clearly identified. In this study, two bacterial strains DS3 and DS5 capable to decolorize distillery wastewater (DWW) pollutants were isolated and characterized as Staphylococcus saprophyticus (MF182113) and Alcaligenaceae sp. (MF182114), respectively. Results showed that mixed bacterial culture was found more effective decolorizing 71.83% DWW compared to axenic culture DS3 and DS5 resulting only 47.94% and 50.67% decolorization, respectively. The FT-IR and LC-MS/MS analysis of untreated DWW showed the presence of many recalcitrant compounds having different functional groups, but after bacterial treatment, most of compounds get diminished and the toxicity of DWW was reduced significantly. Further, the Nile red staining of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to untreated and bacteria treated DWW for evaluation of toxicity assay and results revealed that the worms exposed to untreated DWW showed sharp reduction in total fat content having more profound effects, suggesting the diminished nAchR signaling as compare to bacterial treated DWW. Hence, this study revealed that inadequate disposal of untreated DWW may cause transfer of toxic substances into the environment and receiving water bodies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
