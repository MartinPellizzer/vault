In this study, ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry analytical methods were used for rapid quantification of polysaccharides and 21 nucleosides and amino acids in S. miltiorrhiza to determine 17 samples of different tissues from different areas. Based on the total contents, hierarchical clustering analysis and principal components analysis were performed to classify these samples. The established methods were validated with good linearity, precision, repeatability, stability, and recovery. Chemical analysis revealed a higher content of total analytes in the sample of inflorescence from Nanjing (34.17\u00a0mg/g), sample of root and rhizome from Shaanxi (34.13\u00a0mg/g) and sample of stem and leaf from Nanjing (31.14\u00a0mg/g), respectively, indicating that root and rhizome from Shaanxi and the aerial parts from Nanjing exhibited the highest quality due to their highest content. In addition, contents of nucleosides and amino acids in the aerial parts (14.67\u00a0mg/g) were much higher than that in roots and rhizomes (9.17\u00a0mg/g). This study suggested that UV-visible spectrophotometry and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry are effective techniques to analyze polysaccharides, nucleosides, and amino acids in plants, and they provided valuable information for the development and utilization value of the aerial parts of S. miltiorrhiza. This analysis would also provide useful information for the quality control of S. miltiorrhiza."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
