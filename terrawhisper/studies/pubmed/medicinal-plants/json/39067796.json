Interspecies hybridization and gene introgression during evolution have obscured distinctions among Taxus species, complicating their phylogenetic classification. While the chloroplast genome of Taxus wallichiana, a widely distributed species in China, has been sequenced, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) remains uncharacterized.We sequenced and assembled the T. wallichiana mitogenome using BGI short reads and Nanopore long reads, facilitating comparisons with other gymnosperm mitogenomes. The T. wallichiana mitogenome spanning 469,949\u00a0bp, predominantly forms a circular configuration with a GC content of 50.51%, supplemented by 3 minor configurations mediated by one pair of LRs and two pairs of IntRs. It includes 32 protein-coding genes, 7 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes, several of which exist in multiple copies.We detailed the mitogenome's structure, codon usage, RNA editing, and sequence migration between organelles, constructing a phylogenetic tree to elucidate evolutionary relationships. Unlike typical gymnosperm mitochondria, T. wallichiana shows no evidence of mitochondrial-plastid DNA transfer (MTPT), highlighting its unique genomic architecture. Synteny analysis indicated extensive genomic rearrangements in T. wallichiana, likely driven by recombination among abundant repetitive sequences. This study offers a high-quality T. wallichiana mitogenome, enhancing our understanding of gymnosperm mitochondrial evolution and supporting further cultivation and utilization of Taxus species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
