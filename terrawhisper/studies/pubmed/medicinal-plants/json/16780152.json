Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. were the two major dominant fungi and there was few differences in the type of the fungi among producing areas but differences in the isolation frequency of the furgi; Penicillium spp. , Rhizopus spp. , Aspergillus spp. and Alternaria spp. were the internally dominant seed-borne fungi, including seed capsule and the internal tissue of seed and their fungi-carrying percentage was 8.0%-48.3% and 3.5%-42.0% respectively. There were differences in fungi percentage and dominant seed borne fungi among different producing areas. The disinfection effect of both mancozeb and thriam was up to 89.0%, so it is suggested to use them to disinfect Glycyrrihiza seed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medicine Science, Beijing 100094, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dan", "ForeName": "Hong-Mei", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xian-En", "Initials": "XE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Qiang", "Initials": "JQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12427-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Maneb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0HY55EB9E", "NameOfSubstance": "mancozeb"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X1FSB1OZPT", "NameOfSubstance": "Zineb"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Maneb"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizopus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zineb"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16780152"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
