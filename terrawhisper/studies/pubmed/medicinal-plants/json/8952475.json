This enzyme, which is the only glycosidase able to hydrolyze these naturally occurring thioglucosides, has been found previously to display strong sequence similarities with family 1 O-glycosidases. Myrosinase therefore offers the opportunity to compare the mechanism of enzymatic cleavage of S- vs O-glycosidic bonds. The stereochemistry of hydrolysis of sinigrin by Sinapis alba myrosinase was followed by 1H NMR and the enzyme was found to operate with a mechanism retaining the anomeric configuration at the cleavage point exactly like the related O-glycosidases found in family 1. Myrosinase was readily inactivated by 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucotropaeolin with inactivation kinetic parameters of Ki = 0.9 mM and ki = 0.083 min-1. Reactivation kinetic parameters were determined in buffer only, with k(react) = 0.015 h-1 and t1/2 = 46 h, and also in the presence of acceptors of transglycosylation. No significant changes were observed in the presence of methyl beta-D-glucoside, but with azide anion the half-life of reactivation was found to be reduced to t1/2 = 20 h. These results suggest that myrosinase inhibition by 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucotropaeolin occurs via the accumulation of a long-life glucosyl-enzyme intermediate and that the catalytic machinery of the enzyme is composed of only one catalytic residue, a nucleophilic glutamate, while the acid catalyst residue found in the corresponding O-glycosidases is missing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre de Recherches sur les Macromol\u00e9cules V\u00e9g\u00e9tales, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France."}], "LastName": "Cottaz", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Henrissat", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Driguez", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-deoxy-2-fluroglucotropaeolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosinolates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thioglucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50UM64RMBJ", "NameOfSubstance": "sinigrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.147", "NameOfSubstance": "thioglucosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosinolates"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thioglucosides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8952475", "10.1021/bi9622480", "bi9622480"]}}]}
