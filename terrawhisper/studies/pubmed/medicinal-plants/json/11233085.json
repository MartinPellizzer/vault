Effect of these metabolites on sugar interconvestion and starch and protein accumulation in developing pods was studied. Substituting asparate (62.5 mM) for glutamine in culture medium decreased relative proportion of sucrose in all pod tissues but increased the level of sugars, starch and protein in pod wall and cotyledons. In cotyledons, whereas myo-inositol (75 mM) reduced the accumulation of starch without affecting protein level, alpha-ketoglutarate (44 mM) increased both starch and protein accumulation. Both myo-inositol and alpha-ketoglutarate increased relative proportion of sucrose in cotyledons. Phytic acid (1 mM) decreased in cotyledons 14C incorporation from glucose into EtOH extract (principally constituted by sugars), amino acids and proteins but increased the same into starch. In cotyledons, phytic acid also increased 14C incorporation from glutamate into amino acids but this increase was negatively correlated with protein synthesis. Phytic acid decreased the relative distribution of 14C from glucose and glutamate into sucrose from pod wall but enhanced the same into EtOH extract from embryo. Based on the results, it is suggested that mode of metabolic response to exogenously supplied metabolites widely differs in pod tissues of chickpea."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana 141004, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kaushal", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketoglutaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "30KYC7MIAI", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4L6452S749", "NameOfSubstance": "Inositol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Inositol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ketoglutaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11233085"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
