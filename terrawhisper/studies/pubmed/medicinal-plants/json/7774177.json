Due to unstable conditions in Cambodia, the validity of population data related to present census information is highly questionable. Therefore, prior to this investigation a census registration was carried out using local health workers as registrars in nine villages of a commune. In the period July 4-31, 1991, a total of 1319 individuals (953 women, 366 men, 15-99 yr) were examined by one oral surgeon in the nine villages of Kok Trop Commune, Kandal Stung District, southwest of the capital Phnom Penh. Clinical diagnoses were based on WHO criteria. Information on smoking habits, betel nut chewing habits, and alcohol use was collected by 4 Khmer dental personnel. In total, 71 lesions were recorded in 64 (4.9%) individuals. Leukoplakia was found in 1.1%, lichen lesions in 1.8%, candidosis in 1.4%, submucous fibrosis in 0.2%, cancer in 0.1% and other diagnoses in 0.8%. The prevalence of leukoplakia was 2.2% and 0.6% among men and women respectively, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). There were significantly more smokers (P < 0.01) among subjects with leukoplakia (64.3%) than among those without this lesion (28.6%). All subjects with lichen lesions were women. The age-adjusted relative risk for developing lichen among betel nut chewers as compared to non-chewers was 3.3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, Aichigakuin University, Nagoya, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Handa", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khim", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Durward", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ax\u00e9ll", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mizuno", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fukano", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Oral Epidemiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410263", "ISSNLinking": "0301-5661"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cambodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukoplakia, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lichen Planus, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Precancerous Conditions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7774177", "10.1111/j.1600-0528.1995.tb00197.x"]}}]}
