Fifteen new aloperine-type alkaloids (<b>1</b>-<b>15</b>) as well as six known aloperine-type alkaloids (<b>16</b>-<b>21</b>) were obtained from the extract of <i>S. alopecuroides</i>. The structures of <b>1</b>-<b>21</b> were confirmed via HRESIMS, NMR, UV, IR, ECD calculations, and X-ray diffraction. The antiviral activities of <b>1</b>-<b>21</b> against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were detected following the improved method of half-leaf. Compared with ningnanmycin (protective: 69.7% and curative: 64.3%), <b>15</b> exhibited excellent protective (71.7%) and curative (64.6%) activities against TMV. Further biological studies illustrated that <b>15</b> significantly inhibited the transcription of the TMV-<i>CP</i> gene and increased the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). The antifungal activities of <b>1</b>-<b>21</b> against <i>Phytophythora capsica</i>, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, <i>Alternaria alternata</i>, and <i>Gibberella zeae</i> were screened according to a mycelial inhibition test. Compound <b>13</b> displayed excellent antifungal activity against <i>B. cinerea</i> (EC<sub>50</sub>: 7.38 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> antifungal mechanism studies displayed that <b>13</b> causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species and finally leads to mycelia cell membrane damage and cell death <i>in vitro</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1426-5416"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,
