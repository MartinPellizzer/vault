ESI mass spectra of the chromatographically separated phenols gave the molecular weight of the compounds through prominent [M - H](-) ions for most of the compounds and M(+) ions for the anthocyanins. Collision induced dissociation (CID) of the [M - H](-) (or M(+)) precursor ions yielded product ions which determined the molecular weight of the aglycones. In-source fragmentation followed by CID of the resulting deprotonated aglycone ([A - H](-)) provided product ions for the identification of the unconjugated phenols. The identification was based on comparison with product ion spectra of commercial standards. UV-diode-array spectra were used for identity confirmation. This combined approach allowed the identification in rose hip extract of an anthocyanin, i.e. cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, several glycosides of quercetin and glycosides of taxifolin and eriodictyol. Phloridzin was identified, and several conjugates of methyl gallate were also found, one of which was tentatively identified as methyl gallate-rutinoside. Catechin and quercetin were found as the aglycones in the extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Agricultural University of Norway, As, Norway. erlend.hvattum@ikb.nlh.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hvattum", "ForeName": "Erlend", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom", "NlmUniqueID": "8802365", "ISSNLinking": "0951-4198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11921243", "10.1002/rcm.622", "10.1002/rcm.622"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
