Plants have a wide range of traditional uses, but only a few have been approved therapeutically. Moreover, to our knowledge, no bibliometric analyses on medicinal plants used in psychiatry have been carried out to date. We performed a bibliometric study on scientific publication related to phytotherapy in the psychiatry area during the period 1986-2006. Using the platform Embase.com, including the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, we selected those documents including the descriptors plant*, herb*, phytotherapy*, phytomedicine*, pharmacognosy*, and psychiatry* (with all diagnostic criteria). The plants' indications were selected according to the PDR for Herbal Medicines. As a bibliometric indicator of the production, Price's Law was applied. Another indicator included was the national participation index (PI) for overall scientific production. A total of 21,409 original documents were obtained. Our data confirm a fulfillment of Price's Law related to scientific production on medicinal plants in Psychiatry. This was observed after we made a linear fit (y=135.08x-466.38; r=0.92) and another fit to an exponential curve (y=132.26e(0.1497x); r=0.99). The plants most widely mentioned in the psychiatric literature were St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.; n=937) and ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.; n=694). The countries with the highest percentages of documents were the United States (29.44%), Germany (9.41%) and Japan (8.75%), and those with highest proportional PI were India (IPa=0.935) and China (IPa=0.721). Productivity on medicinal plants in the psychiatry area increased during the period 1986-2006. Nevertheless, documents about therapeutic herbs in this medical field are still relatively few in number."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Alcal\u00e1, C/ Juan Ignacio Luca de Tena 8, 28027 Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "L\u00f3pez-Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rubio", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00edn-Agueda", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alamo", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bibliometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomedical Research"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mental Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicals as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Publishing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18583120", "10.1016/j.phymed.2008.04.014", "S0944-7113(08)00089-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
