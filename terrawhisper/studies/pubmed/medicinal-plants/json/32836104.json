This study describes a novel continuous chromatography system (CCS) with multi-zone and multi-column dynamic tandem techniques for the efficient and economical separation and enrichment of high-content class compounds from natural products. The CCS was split into eight zones (each zone covered 2 or 3 columns connected dynamically in a series) via a multi-channel logic control valve to continuously and automatically separate and enrich class compounds from complex natural plants. CCS separation conditions were optimized by static and dynamic adsorption and desorption experiments. With the CCS system, 120.82 kg of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) was isolated from 1.0 t of P. notoginseng. Importantly, the total contents of five main saponins (R<sub>1</sub>, Rg<sub>1</sub>, Re, Rb<sub>1</sub>, and Rd) in PNS exceeded 90%, and the recovery rate exceeded 85%. In addition, this separation system enhanced the separation efficiency and decreased the mobile phase used. Thus, CCS with multi-zone and multi-column dynamic tandem techniques is an efficient and economical method for the large-scale preparation of high-content total saponins from P. notoginseng and will have wide application prospects, especially in the large-scale preparation of high-content class compounds from natural plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
