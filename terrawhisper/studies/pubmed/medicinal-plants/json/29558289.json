Although the pharmacological properties of GAs have long been known, attention to them has greatly increased in recent times due to their cytotoxic activity.", "This review represents the patents granted about natural and synthetic glycyrrhetinic acid analogs from January 2010 to December 2017, the advances made by research groups in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery of new natural or synthetic glycyrrhetinic acid analogs.", "GAs demonstrate excellent cytotoxic, antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and antiviral effects. It is interesting to note that the C-<sub>3</sub>(OH) and C<sub>30-</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H functional groups make GAs very attractive lead structures for medicinal scientists since these functionalities allow the generation of further chemical diversity for improved pharmacological effects. Moreover, various GA analogues have been prepared via modification of the C<sub>30-</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H. It is noteworthy that the C-30 amide of GA demonstrated better cytotoxic effects compared to the parent compounds. In addition, GAs have the capability to conjugate with other anticancer drugs or be converted into their halo or amino analogs which is expected to stimulate medicinal chemist to synthesize new lead compounds in cancer drug discovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Bioorganic Chemistry , Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry , Halle (Saale) , Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Sultanate of Oman."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science , University of Stellenbosch , Stellenbosch , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Ivan R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Chemistry , Quaid-i-Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shamraiz", "ForeName": "Umair", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Chemistry , The Islamia University of Bahawalpur , Bahawalpur , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Chemistry , Quaid-i-Azam University , Islamabad , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Badshah", "ForeName": "Amin", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Biological Sciences and Chemistry, College of Arts and Sciences , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Sultanate of Oman."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b UoN Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants and Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Sultanate of Oman."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Najeeb Ur", "Initials": "NU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Chemistry , University of Kotli , Azad Jammu & Kashmir , Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Irshad", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1449-05-4", "NameOfSubstance": "18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P540XA09DR", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29558289", "10.1080/13543776.2018.1455828"]}}]}
