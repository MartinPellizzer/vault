In this work, we introduce an optimized band-target entropy minimization approach for the analysis of complex mass spectral data. This new approach enables an automated mass spectral analysis which does not require any user-dependent inputs. Moreover, the approach provides improved sensitivity and accuracy for mass spectral reconstruction of severely co-eluting and trace-level components. The accuracy of our approach is compared to the automatic mass spectral deconvolution and identification system (AMDIS) with two controlled mixtures and a sample of Eucalyptus essential oil. Our approach was able to putatively identify 130 compounds in Eucalyptus essential oil, which was 46% in excess of that identified by AMDIS. This new approach is expected to benefit GC-MS analysis of complex mixtures such as biological samples and essential oils, in which the data are often complicated by co-eluting and trace-level components.
