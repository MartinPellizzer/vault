In recent decades, purple coneflower has become extremely well known. An infusion or tincture of purple coneflower can be prepared by anyone simply, inexpensively, and ecologically safely. Three plant parts of purple coneflower were used in the study: extracts from roots, flowers, and leaves were obtained using three different solvents (100% and 40% ethanol and water). High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometer identified and quantified 23 individual phenolics. Pure (100%) ethanol gave the lowest yield of all the investigated phenolic compounds in all herb parts. Chicoric and caftaric acids were the major phenolic compounds in coneflower. Caftaric acid, with health promoting properties, was extracted best in a water solution from purple coneflower leaves (2673.31\u2009mg/100\u2009g dry weight [DW]) and chicoric acid, also with a beneficial effect on human health, yielded the highest levels in 40% ethanol solution from flowers (1571.79\u2009mg/100\u2009g DW) and roots (1396.27\u2009mg/100\u2009g DW)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Chair for Fruit Growing, Viticulture and Vegetable Growing, Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Senica", "ForeName": "Mateja", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Department of Nephrology, Centre for Kidney Transplantation, University Medicinal Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Mlinsek", "ForeName": "Gregor", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Chair for Fruit Growing, Viticulture and Vegetable Growing, Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Veberic", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Chair for Fruit Growing, Viticulture and Vegetable Growing, Department of Agronomy, Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "Mikulic-Petkovsek", "ForeName": "Maja", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Succinates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Teas, Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S4YY3V8YHD", "NameOfSubstance": "chicoric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WCV7W3174L", "NameOfSubstance": "caftaric acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Succinates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teas, Herbal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30222488", "10.1089/jmf.2018.0026"]}}]}
