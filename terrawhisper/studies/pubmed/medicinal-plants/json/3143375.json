These two aldehydes can be separated from one another and identified by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Three types of stereospecific abstraction of a hydrogen from the alpha-carbon of dopamine during deamination have been observed. In the first type, the pro-R hydrogen is removed from the alpha-carbon. Enzymes in this category are mitochondrial monoamine oxidases A and B, as isolated from different tissues and species. The second type of deamination involves the abstraction of pro-S hydrogen from the alpha-carbon of dopamine. Soluble enzymes, such as rat aorta benzylamine oxidase or diamine oxidase from hog kidney and pea seedling, have been found to belong to this group. Bovine plasma amine oxidase exhibits the third type of deamination where no absolute stereospecificity is required. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of either (S)- or (R)-[alpha-2H1]dopamine, preferably breaking the C-H bond rather than the C-2H bond in both cases. The kinetic deuterium isotope effect during the deamination of dopamine catalyzed by the different amine oxidases varies greatly; VH/VD ranges from 1.5 to 5.5. The high magnitude of the isotope effect suggests that hydrogen abstraction may be the rate-limiting step (i.e., in reactions catalyzed by benzylamine oxidase and monoamine oxidase). When the isotope effect is low (i.e., for diamine oxidases from hog kidney or pea seedling), it is uncertain if the breaking of the bond is rate limiting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuropsychiatric Research Unit, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "P H", "Initials": "PH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8606068", "ISSNLinking": "0829-8211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "102-32-9", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5707-55-1", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AR09D82C7G", "NameOfSubstance": "Deuterium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzylamine Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzylamine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Deuterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Monoamine Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3143375", "10.1139/o88-097"]}}]}
