However, purpurin's in vivo and in vitro antioxidant mechanism remains unexplored. The present study explores the anti-oxidative mechanism of purpurin under the influence of alcohol using in vivo and in vitro test systems.", "Mice hepatocytes and alcohol-induced liver toxicity model were used to evaluate the effect of purpurin. The non-enzymatic and enzymatic oxidative stress markers were estimated by the colorimetric method. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantified in mitochondria and cells using flow cytometer. Real-time PCR and western blotting were used to quantify cytochrome 450 subtype 2E1 (CYP2E1) and Nrf2 expression in the liver tissue of mice. In silico studies were performed through receptor-ligand binding interaction.", "Purpurin effectively reduced total cellular and mitochondrial ROS in primary hepatocytes and WRL-68 cells. It prevented alcohol-induced ROS-dependent biochemical and cellular insults observed by analysing the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) levels and CYP2E1 expression in liver tissue of alcohol-administered mice. Moreover, it also restored the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Its antioxidant effect was established by glutathione and ROS-dependent mechanisms using buthionine sulfoximine and N-acetyl cysteine. Along with alcohol, purpurin up-regulated Nrf2 expression in hepatocytes.", "This work confirmed the ameliorative effect of purpurin for alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity by drabbing free radicals and curbing oxidative stress via activation of antioxidant signalling pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
