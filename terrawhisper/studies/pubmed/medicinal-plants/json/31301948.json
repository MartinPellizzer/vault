We aimed to develop potent anti-HBV adefovir derivatives with hepatotrophic properties and reduced nephrotoxicity. A series of adefovir mono l-amino acids, mono cholic acid-drug conjugates were designed and synthesized, and their antiviral activity and uptake in rat primary hepatocytes and Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP)-HEK293 cells were evaluated. We isolated compound 6c as the optimal molecular candidate, with the highest antiviral activity (EC<sub>50</sub> 0.42\u202f\u03bcmol/L, SI 1063.07) and highest cellular uptake in primary hepatocytes and NTCP-HEK293 cells. In-depth mechanistic studies demonstrated that 6c exhibited a lower toxicity in HK-2 cells when compared to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). This is because 6c cannot be transported by the human renal organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1). Furthermore, pharmacokinetic characterization and tissue distribution of 6c indicates it has favorable druggability and pharmacokinetic properties. Further docking studies suggested compounds with ursodeoxycholic acid and l-amino acid groups are better at binding to NTCP due to their hydrophilic properties, indicating that 6c is a potential candidate as an anti-HBV therapy and therefore merits further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
