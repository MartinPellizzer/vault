We aimed not only to confirm the apoptogenic properties of GGA and its derivatives, but also to search for natural GGA in medicinal herbs. GGA induced apoptosis in human hepatoma-derived cell lines, HuH-7, PLC/PRF-5, and mouse transformed hepatocyte-derived cell line, MLE-10, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, but failed to induce cell death in human hepatoblastoma-derived HepG-2 and mouse primary hepatocytes in the same condition. Besides GGA, 4,5-didehydro GGA, 14,15-dihydro GGA, and 2,3-dihydro GGA were also active to induce cell death in HuH-7 cells, while 4,5-didehydro-10,11, 14,15-tetrahydro GGA, 4,5,8,9-tetrahydro GGA, farnesoic acid, and geranylgeraniol were inert. By using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we found natural GGA as a negative ion of m/z 303.4 in a Chinese herb, Schisandra chinensis, and Schisandra GGA was identified by derivatization with both mild methylation and catalytic hydrogenation. Some other GGAs hydrogenated in the different degrees, including phytanic acid (perhydro GGA), were also found in S. chinensis. GGA and phytanic acid were detected in 24 out of 25 herbs tested. The present study is the first report of natural GGA in medicinal herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Graduate School of Human Health Sciences, Siebold University of Nagasaki, Nagayo, Nagasaki 851-2195, Japan. shidoji@sun.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shidoji", "ForeName": "Yoshihiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogawa", "ForeName": "Hiroko", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Lipid Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0376606", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2275"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "83807-40-3", "NameOfSubstance": "geranylgeranic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15060084", "10.1194/jlr.M300502-JLR200", "S0022-2275(20)31807-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
