In both experiments, five individually caged hens were used for each of the four treatment replications. Treatments for Experiment 1 consisted of a control and six diets with ground C. obtusifolia seed substituted for a filler at levels of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7%. In Experiment 2, a series of nutritionally fortified (15 to 20% higher nutrient levels) and unfortified diets coupled with seed levels of 0, 4, 6, and 8% for a total of eight treatments was used. Average daily feed intake, hen-day egg production, egg weight, egg specific gravity, and body weight change were determined during each experiment. For Experiment 1, average daily feed consumption was measured every 24 h for the first 3 days. Egg production and feed consumption were significantly reduced by 2% seed in Experiment 1. Within the first 24 h, feed intake was decreased to 37% below that of controls by increasing to the highest seed level. Egg specific gravity dropped significantly below that of controls when hens were fed 5% seed. In Experiment 2, fortification improved feed consumption, hen-day egg production, body weight change, and egg specific gravity over that of birds fed unfortified diets with the same seed level. Finished diets contaminated with 2%, or more, C. obtusifolia seed can cause reduced performance in laying hens, but nutritionally fortifying these diets can help to alleviate depressed performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Poultry Science, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611."}], "LastName": "Flunker", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Damron", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sundlof", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cassia"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Specific Gravity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2780479", "10.3382/ps.0680909", "S0032-5791(19)57257-1"]}}]}
