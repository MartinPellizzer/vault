The activity in the roots appears to be similar to that of the seeds in respect to their sugar inhibition property. Seed and root extracts were found to have fetuin inhibitory agglutinating activity, whereas cotyledons showed different sugar specificity. However, 7-day cotyledons and roots from 3 and 7-day plants were also found to have galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine inhibitory activity. Protein profile in different tissues during their developmental stages was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A major band at 66 kDa was common to all tissues at different stages of their development except 3-day cotyledons where 2 major bands at 22 kDa and 74 kDa were observed. Two prominent bands at 74 kDa and 86 kDa were found along with 60 kDa protein in 3-day old roots whereas a major band at 33 kDa was found in 15-day old roots. Total protein content and specific activity of hemagglutinin were measured. Increase in specific activity with lower protein content was observed in cotyledons of 15-day old plant. Specific activity was eight times higher in the roots and four times more in leaf tissues of 7-day old plants in comparison to 15-day old plants. Stems also showed a significant increase of specific activity (p = 0.013) in 7-day old plants without any significant alteration in the protein content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Glycobiology Division, Centre for Biochemical Technology, CSIR, Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "G N", "Initials": "GN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemagglutinins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Goats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1992 Sep 15;1117(2):114-9", "ArticleIdList": ["1525173"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1978 Apr 18;17(8):1474-9", "ArticleIdList": ["646995"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1978 May;61(5):779-84", "ArticleIdList": ["16660384"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Biochem Biophys. 1972 Mar;149(1):323-6", "ArticleIdList": ["4622779"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1998 Nov 6;282(5391):1049", "ArticleIdList": ["9841450"]}, {"Citation": "Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem. 1983 Jun;364(6):655-64", "ArticleIdList": ["6884991"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998 Jun 5;1381(1):7-11", "ArticleIdList": ["9659367"]}, {"Citation": "Indian J Biochem Biophys. 1997 Feb-Apr;34(1-2):72-5", "ArticleIdList": ["9343931"]}, {"Citation": "Glycoconj J. 1995 Feb;12 (1):45-50", "ArticleIdList": ["7540901"]}, {"Citation": "J Biol Chem. 1951 Nov;193(1):265-75", "ArticleIdList": ["14907713"]}, {"Citation": "Glycoconj J. 1994 Aug;11(4):282-5", "ArticleIdList": ["7873922"]}, {"Citation": "Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Nov 9;1036(2):162-5", "ArticleIdList": ["2223834"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11030478", "10.1023/a:1008140201453"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
