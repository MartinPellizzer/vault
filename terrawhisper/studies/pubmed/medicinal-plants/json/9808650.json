To determine the reason, we infused four cannulated pigs intravenously, fed them a pea-based diet with 15N-leucine, and examined some methodological variables. Neither the blood sampling time nor the choice of precursor pool (total N or amino acid N of deproteinized plasma) or the method of estimation of the isotopic equilibrium level significantly affected the results. On the other hand, the 15N-enrichment of purified mucin, isolated from ileal digesta, was higher than that of the plasma amino acid pool (0.114 vs. 0.077 atom % excess). The endogenous proportion of the labeled amino acids (Ala, Gly, Ile, Leu and Val) in the ileal digesta ranged from 23 (Leu) to 74% (Ala), compared with 70% for total N. The low value of leucine was ascribed to the constant marker infusion condition. In pigs infused with 13C-leucine, a similar endogenous proportion was obtained for lumenal leucine with 13C-leucine and 15N-leucine infusion. However, the 13C-enrichment of the leucine bound to mucin was markedly lower than that of plasma leucine (38%). The endogenous amino acid flows were also estimated by combining the ileal N flow measured with 15N and the endogenous amino acid profile obtained by means of an N-free diet. They were different from those obtained with the 15N-amino acid dilution technique. We conclude that the precursor pool currently used (plasma total N or total alpha-amino acid N pools) is a poor indicator of the enrichment of the secretions and that the infusion of one labeled amino acid is not sufficient to extend the method at the amino acid level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facult\u00e9 Universitaire des Sciences Agronomiques, Unit\u00e9 de Zootechnie, 5030 Gembloux, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Leterme", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "S\u00e8ve", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Th\u00e9wis", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mucins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GMW67QNF9C", "NameOfSubstance": "Leucine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "False Positive Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicator Dilution Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leucine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mucins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Isotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9808650", "10.1093/jn/128.11.1961"]}}]}
