Dunal) is a versatile medicinal plant of Solanaceae family, renowned for its potent therapeutic properties, due to which it is extensively used in Indian traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda. The medicinal properties are attributed to specialized metabolites known as withanolides, which are chemically triterpenoid steroidal lactones. Despite their significance, the biosynthetic pathway of withanolides remains poorly understood. It is hypothesized that withanolides are synthesized through the universal sterol pathway, wherein sterol precursors undergo various biochemical modifications such as hydroxylation, oxidation, cyclization, and glycosylation, yielding a diverse array of downstream withanolides and withanosides. Consequently, comprehending the biosynthetic pathway of withanolides is crucial to facilitate advancements in withanolides productivity through metabolic engineering or synthetic biology approaches. This article aims to provide an update on the efforts made toward\u00a0understanding withanolides formation and regulation\u00a0and highlights gaps and approaches to elucidate the withanolides biosynthesis in W.\u00a0somnifera."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
