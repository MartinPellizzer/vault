Sister nuclei were studied in binucleate cells, induced by treatment with 0.1% caffeine, and in sister mononucleate cells of untreated roots. Excised pea roots, grown in culture, were treated with 5-aminouracil to induce mitotic synchrony and with caffeine at the time of peak mitotic index, to provide the maximum number of binucleate cells. The induced binucleate cells form a marked population which was followed through a cell cycle; sister nuclei showed a correlation of volume and protein content, r = 0.79. Protein contents of sister nuclei were rarely identical and at 1 + 2 and 1 + 6 h the difference in protein contents of sister nuclei was significant (p = 0.05). Mean nuclear protein content decreased from 1 + 2 to 1 + 6 h; then, as nuclei entered S phase, their protein content increased. From 1 + 2 to 1 + 14 h the increase in protein content, in absolute amount, was identical in both sister nuclei. This suggests that there was a biphasic pattern of protein uptake; it is differential, in sister nuclei, in the first part of G1 but is identical throughout the rest of interphase. Analysis of sister nuclei from sister mononucleate cells showed a similar pattern of change; this is further evidence, from untreated cells, of a biophasic pattern of protein uptake. Caffeine-treated nuclei had lower protein contents than untreated nuclei, yet they completed a cell cycle and entered mitosis; this suggests that nonessential proteins were no longer present. It is proposed that mitosis is asymmetrical for molecules that regulate rates of macromolecular synthesis, cell growth, and progress through a cell cycle and that once the initial asymmetry has been established, it is maintained throughout interphase, even in binucleate cells in which the two nuclei share a common cytoplasm."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Armstrong", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davidson", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0421034", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4018"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56HH86ZVCT", "NameOfSubstance": "Uracil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R2O7EKY9G9", "NameOfSubstance": "5-aminouracil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interphase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Uracil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7083048", "10.1139/o82-044"]}}]}
