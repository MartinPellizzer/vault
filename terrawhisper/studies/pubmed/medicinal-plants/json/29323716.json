FH is characterized by accelerated development of atherosclerosis and represents the most frequent hereditary cause of premature coronary heart disease. Mutations of the LDL receptor gene are the genetic signature of FH, resulting in abnormal levels of circulating LDLs. Moreover, FH promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which is another key mechanism involved in atherosclerosis development and progression. The aim of this narrative review is to update the current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms linking FH to ROS generation and their detrimental impact on atherosclerotic pathophysiology. With this purpose, we reviewed experimental and clinical data on the association between FH and OS and the functional role of OS as a promoter of inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this regard, oxidant species such as oxidized LDL, malondialdehyde, ROS, and isoprostanes emerged as leading mediators of the oxidative injury in FH. In conclusion, targeting oxidative stress may be a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce atherogenesis in patients with FH."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Carbone", "ForeName": "Federico", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "First Clinic of Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genoa, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy."}], "LastName": "Montecucco", "ForeName": "Fabrizio", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Internal Medicine, Angiology and Arteriosclerosis Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy."}], "LastName": "Pirro", "ForeName": "Matteo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8656-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "oxidized low density lipoprotein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Atherosclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29323716", "10.1002/jcp.26466"]}}]}
