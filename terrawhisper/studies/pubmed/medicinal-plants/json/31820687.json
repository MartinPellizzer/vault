Presently, there is no specific treatment/ drug available for curing RA except few supportive medicines. Therefore, the focus has been shifted to medicinal plants for the treatment of such diseases. Choerospondias axillaris commonly known as Lupsi/Lapsi and has been reported to have several properties for the treatment of various diseases.", "The present study has been conducted to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of Choerospondias axillaris fruit extract on Synoviocytes (FLS) and Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat model.", "Methanolic extract of the Choerospondias axillaris fruit was used for determining phytochemical, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Antioxidant activity of Choerospondias axillaris fruit was determined by free radicals scavenging assays and bioactive compounds were identified via LC-MS/MS analysis. Anti-inflammatory effect was investigated in RA and Osteo Arthritis (OA) primary cells and also in Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat models. Further, the medicinal properties of anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds were supported by docking studies.", "In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Docking analysis revealed that quercetin inhibits TNF-\u03b1 having -9.1 kcal/mol binding energy and 10.13 \u03bcM inhibitory constant. Quercetin also inhibits IL-6 having -6.6 kcal/mol binding energy and 21.9 \u03bcM inhibitory constant.", "Observed results suggest that the underutilized fruit Choerospondias axillaris can be used to reduce the inflammation of inflammatory diseases like RA."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Mann", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ankita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Ashish", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Kharb", "ForeName": "Rupsi", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi-110029, India."}], "LastName": "Malhotra", "ForeName": "Rajesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Army Hospital Research and Referral, Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi-110010, India."}], "LastName": "Datta", "ForeName": "Barun", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Chemistry, Delhi Technological University, New Delhi-110042, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Rajinder K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mall Road, Delhi-110007, India."}], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "Sagarika", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anacardiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Primary Cell Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31820687", "10.2174/1389201021666191210114127", "CPB-EPUB-102875"]}}]}
