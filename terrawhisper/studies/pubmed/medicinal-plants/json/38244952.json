There is, however, limited consolidated information about the selection of plant species, the purpose of use and how the preparation is made. An in-depth examination of how regional communities use medicinal plants for blood purification is needed to better understand this ethnopharmacological practice.", "To gather knowledge on the traditional use of medicinal plants used for the purpose of blood purification by laypersons in northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.", "An ethnobotanical survey was conducted on medicinal plants used in the rural areas of northern Maputaland for blood purification. Interviews were conducted in 55 homesteads, where the most knowledgeable participant per household was interviewed using structured questionnaires. Information collected included knowledge of the concept of blood purification, purpose for medicating, plant selection, and mode of preparation. The most important species and families were identified through indices.", "Sixty-four plant species from 35 families were recorded as blood purifiers for the treatment of ailments linked to the need for blood purification. Terminalia sericea Burch. ex DC. was the most used plant species (mentioned by 39% of the people interviewed). The conditions that were mostly associated with blood purification were skin complaints, gastro-intestinal disorders, and overall improvement of general health. Blood purification is also commonly used for non-medical purposes such as granting good luck or as a love charm. Six new plant species and five new Zulu vernacular names had not previously been documented for blood purification.", "The frequently mentioned use of medicinal plants for blood purification by the rural community of northern Maputaland clearly emphasises the importance of this cultural practice. There is no doubt that when examining African traditional medicine, holistic terms such as \"blood cleansing\" cannot be ignored. Future studies may provide a better understanding of this often misunderstood and undocumented practice."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
