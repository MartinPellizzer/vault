The DNA barcoding universal sequence for authentication of the Dendrobium medical plants was slected and the possibility concerning utilizing the DNA barcoding to distinguish the D. huoshanenseand its adulterants was analyzed. Using the universal primer pair of ITS2, rbcL and matK, series of extended sequencing in the Dendrobium were conducted. Meanwhile, considering the different index about amplification and sequencing success rate of each sequence, the intraspecific and interspecific aberrance, the employment of BioEdit and MEGA 5.0 software were applied to establish the systematic tree of the NJ molecular and evaluate the diversified authentication capability of various sequences. The consequence demonstrates that the sequence of ITS2 is not only the largest one both in the intraspecific and interspecific aberrance of the Dendrobium but also has obvious barcoding gap. Considering the few overlap between the intraspecific and interspecific aberrance and the highest percentage regarding the formation of unilateral branch in diverse Dendrobium which have different ITS2 sequences, it can differentiate the species of Dendrobium. Furthermore, due to the inferior success rate of the rbcL and thematK and the lower reliability of NJ systematic tree, the percentage of the unilateral species which are generated by the systematic tree of rbcL and matK sequences is deficient. Therefore, the sequence of ITS2 can serves as DNA barcoding to distinguish the D. huoshanense, the D. moniliform and the D. officinale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of the Conservation and Exploitation of Biological Resources, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of the Conservation and Exploitation of Biological Resources, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Ling-Ling", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wannan Medical College, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jue", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of the Conservation and Exploitation of Biological Resources, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu 241000, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Guo-Ping", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30486530", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2018.0107"]}}]}
