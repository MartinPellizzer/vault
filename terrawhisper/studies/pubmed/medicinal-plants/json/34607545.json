Merr. is a well-known plant used in folkloric medicine in tropical Asian countries. The plant is prevalently employed by traditional healers in the treatment of diabetes, cancer, hypertension, inflammation, fever, and skin disorders. Several scientific studies reported that Gynura procumbens possesses considerable therapeutic value for the development of emerging treatment options. The diverse pharmacological effects of this plant are attributed to its vast phytoconstituent content. Different chemical classes, including alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, proteins, and polysaccharides, have been isolated from this plant. In this review, we tried to explore the different aspects of Gynura procumbens as an established medicinal plant. The data gathered here give an indication that the plant Gynura procumbens is a good natural source of chemical compounds with different types of pharmacological actions, and these chemical compounds can be used as models for the development of de novo therapeutic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology and Herbal Drug Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Haque", "ForeName": "Ehfazul", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Deaprtment of Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Kamal", "ForeName": "Mir Shahriar", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Tahsin", "ForeName": "Md Rafat", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology and Herbal Drug Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Raju", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Choudhury", "ForeName": "Jakir Ahmed", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology and Herbal Drug Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Chowdhury", "ForeName": "Abu Asad", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology and Herbal Drug Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Kabir", "ForeName": "Shaila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Molecular Pharmacology and Herbal Drug Research Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Dhaka, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Amran", "ForeName": "Md Shah", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Southeast University, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Uddin", "ForeName": "Md Sahab", "Initials": "MS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "LS20191133, :37.20.0000.004.033.020.2016.1053", "Agency": "Ministry of Education, Government of Peoples\u2019 Republic of Bangladesh", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34607545", "10.2174/1568026621666211004094902", "CTMC-EPUB-118276"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
