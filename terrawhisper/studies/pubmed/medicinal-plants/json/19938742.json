Several concentrations of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract were tested to find the minimal cysticidal concentrations (MCC) of both agents, at these concentrations there was no viable cyst which was confirmed by no excystment after further incubation for 7 days. The cysts were prepared for routine transmission and scanning electron microscopic studies.", "Structural damages of the treated cysts by MCC of PVP-I and fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract showed a series of damages. Starting from shrinkage, destruction or rupture of the cyst walls and opercula, withdrawal of the cytoplasm or edema cyst by the outside solution passed through the damaged wall caused a decrease in wrinkle ridges of the ectocyst. Then the cyst was ripped and torn into small pieces", "MCC of PVP-I solution and the fraction 2 of Pouzolzia indica methanolic extract were 0.04% and 1:4, respectively. The structural damages were somewhat similar, such as the shrinkage, ruptured cyst wall and opercula, edema and end by breaking up of the cyst wall and degeneration of the inside cytosol. Pouzolzia indica may be modified as an effective disinfectant solution for a contact lens case if the active ingredients are more purified."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roongruangchai", "ForeName": "Jantima", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sookkua", "ForeName": "Tichaporn", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kummalue", "ForeName": "Tanawan", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Roongruangchai", "ForeName": "Kosol", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "J Med Assoc Thai", "NlmUniqueID": "7507216", "ISSNLinking": "0125-2208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "85H0HZU99M", "NameOfSubstance": "Povidone-Iodine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Acanthamoeba"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Acanthamoeba Keratitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Povidone-Iodine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19938742"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
