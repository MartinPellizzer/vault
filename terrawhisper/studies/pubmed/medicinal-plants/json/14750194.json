Treatment with chyavanaprasha, consecutively for fi ve days before irradiation, delayed symptoms of radiation sickness and onset of mortality when compared with the non-drug treated irradiated controls. All doses of chyavanaprasha provided a significant protection against gastrointestinal (GI) death (death of animals within 10 days after exposure to radiation), however, highest protection against GI death was observed for 15 mg/kg chyavanaprasha. Chyavanaprasha also provided a significant protection against the bone marrow death after 10 to 40 mg/kg. However, the best protection was seen for 15 mg/kg, where the highest number of survivors was observed at the end of 30 days post-irradiation. The drug was non-toxic up to a dose of 6 g/kg b. wt., the highest drug dose that could be tested. Our study demonstrates that chyavanaprasha can provide good radioprotection at a very low non-toxic dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiobiology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India. gc.jagetia@kmc.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jagetia", "ForeName": "Ganesh Chandra", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baliga", "ForeName": "Manjeshwar Shrinath", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Injuries, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14750194", "10.1002/ptr.1298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
