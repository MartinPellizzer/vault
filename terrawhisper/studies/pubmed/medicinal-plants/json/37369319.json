In the present study, four different fractionation strategies of hydrothermal-, NaOH-, ethanol-, and NaOH catalyzed ethanol pretreatment were investigated to compare their abilities of cellulose conversion. Results showed that NaOH catalyzed ethanol pretreatment showed a rather high extent of delignification of 85.92%, which also enhanced the retention of cellulose (92.56%) and hemicellulose (76.57%); while other pretreatments tended to produce cellulose fraction which was insufficient to achieve the whole component utilization. After simultaneous saccharification and fermentation at high solids loading, synergistic maximization of xylose (42.47\u00a0g/L) and ethanol (85.74\u00a0g/L) output was achieved via alkaline ethanol pretreatment. Lignin characterization information showed that alkaline ethanol pretreatment facilitates the cleavage of \u03b2-O-4 linkage and further converts into arylglycerol. Moreover, less condensed substructure units with high processing activity were also generated in S- and G- lignin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
