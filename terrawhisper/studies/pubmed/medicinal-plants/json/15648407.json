Gastric mucosal damage was produced in rats by administering 200 mg/kg orally. Aspirin was found to cause severe haemorrhagic lesions mainly through oxidative damage of the mucosa as indicated by increased lipid peroxidation, conjugated diene, protein carbonyl content, decreased levels of antioxidant defense enzymes and alteration in the lipid levels. This damage was treated with the aqueous extract of ambrex (40 mg/kg) for 15 days orally. Pre-administration of ambrex at a dose of 40 mg/kg, decreased the ulcer index, lipid peroxidation, conjugated diene and protein carbonyl content and increased the antioxidant enzyme levels. The lipid levels were maintained at near normalcy when treated with ambrex in aspirin administered rats. The major mechanism involved appears due to free radical scavenging action and changes in lipid profile."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Chennai-600 025."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jainu", "ForeName": "Mallika", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "C S Shyamala", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374707", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5499"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Amber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15648407"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
