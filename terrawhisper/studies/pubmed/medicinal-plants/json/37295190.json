The separation and purification of natural glycosides are meaningful for their pharmacological research, which face with great challenges due to the complex of medicinal plants samples. In this work, two kinds of functional monolithic separation mediums A and S were fabricated and fully applied in the online extraction, separation and purification of active glycoside components from medicinal plants with a simple-procedure closed-loop mode. Chrysophanol glucoside and physcion glucoside were detected and separated from Rhei Radix et Rhizoma using separation medium A as a solid-phase extraction adsorbent. Rhapontin was isolated and purified from Rheum hotaoense C. Y. Cheng et Kao using separation medium S as the stationary phase of high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to the reported literatures, high yield of 5.68, 1.20 and 4.76\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> of these three products were obtained with high purity. These two online closed-loop mode methods were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography system, in which the sample injection, isolation and purification procedures are all online mode, and reduced loss compared to offline extraction and purification procedures, thus achieving high recovery and high purity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
