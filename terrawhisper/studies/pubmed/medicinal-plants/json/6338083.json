Over 400 years ago, herbalists listed the plant as being poisonous. In fiction, the homicidal use of digitalis has appeared in the writings of Mary Webb, Dorothy Sayers and Agatha Christie. Ten instances in real life of alleged homicide by digitalis and trials of the accused are listed. The drug has been used with suicidal intent rather infrequently, compared with other medications. Possibly, it is more commonly used for such a purpose in France than in England or the United States. The fraudulent use of digitalis in the support of claims for disability because of heart disease has occurred, and one large conspiracy of physicians and lawyers in the swindle of insurance companies during the 1930s is a shameful episode in the record of these professions. Although innocent, one professor of medicine who was involved committed suicide. Two pharmaceutical (manufacturing) blunders that occurred in Belgium and Holland with mislabeling are mentioned. These resulted in numerous deaths and the profession seemed rather slow to recognize the nature of these small epidemics of poisoning. Instances of psychiatric illness with digitalis seem well documented. The story of digitalis toxicity continues into the present and physicians should be vigilant regarding the drug's potential for poisoning that can result from prescribing digitalis with ignorance of proper dosage, pharmacodynamics or drug interactions, as well as from accidental overdose as in children and use with self-destructive or homicidal intent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burchell", "ForeName": "H B", "Initials": "HB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8301365", "ISSNLinking": "0735-1097"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Factitious Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Forensic Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Literature, Modern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medication Errors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suicide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6338083", "10.1016/s0735-1097(83)80080-1", "S0735-1097(83)80080-1"]}}]}
