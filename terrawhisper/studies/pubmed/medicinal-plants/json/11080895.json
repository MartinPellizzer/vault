A. Meyer) and North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.). The method is based on the baseline chromatographic separation of ginsenoside Rf and 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11, two potential chemical markers present in ginseng root methanolic extracts, and their unambiguous on-line identification using tandem mass spectrometry. Consistent with the literature, 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11 was detected in abundance in North American ginseng roots in excess of 0.1% (w/w) of the dried root. In contrast to some reports, 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11 was also identified in Asian ginseng roots at trace levels using LC-MS-MS but at less than 0.0001% (w/w). Besides showing identical tandem mass spectra to authentic 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11, the corresponding compound in Asian ginseng root coeluted with standard under different HPLC conditions, thus confirming this compound as 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11. Another ginsenoside often used to distinguish Asian and North American ginseng, ginsenoside Rf, was found in abundance in Asian ginseng roots at more than 0.021% (w/w). In Asian ginseng roots, the ratio of ginsenoside Rf to 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11 exceeded 700:1. The limit of detection of ginsenoside Rf or 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11 was 120 pg injected on-column, and the limit of quantification was 240 pg on-column. In summary, LC-MS-MS analysis of ginseng products for the presence and ratio of ginsenoside Rf and 24(R)-pseudoginsenoside F11 may be used for the unambiguous identification of Asian and North American ginsengs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago 60612, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Awang", "ForeName": "D V", "Initials": "DV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fitzloff", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fong", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Breemen", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P50 AT00155", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11080895", "10.1021/ac000650l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
