The Purpose was to determine the efficacy of O. majorana and F. vulgare aqueous extracts (AEs) on Blastocystis spp. in vitro, and to reveal their phenolic, flavonoids components and antioxidant activities through chemical analysis.", "The Efficacy of both plant AEs on human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) viability was assessed using MTT assay. Isolated Blastocystis spp. cysts from patients' diarrhea samples were incubated with different concentrations of O. majorana and F. vulgare AEs for different incubation periods (24, 48 and 72\u202fh) in comparison with nitazoxanide (NTZ) as a drug control. The total contents of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the AEs and their ability to reduce DPPH were assessed. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis for quantitative and qualitative determination of the phenolic and flavonoid contents was performed.", "O. majorana AE at a dose of 400\u202f\u00b5g /ml showed efficacy rates of 96% and 100% against Blastocystis parasite after 48 and 72\u202fh, respectively, which nearly equivalent to NTZ at a dose of 500\u202f\u00b5g/ml. F. vulgare at a dose of 250\u202f\u00b5g/ml showed less efficacy rate of 56.4% after 48\u202fh and increased to 70.7% after 72\u202fh. Both extracts contain high phenolic and flavonoid compounds that possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities.", "O. majorana and F. vulgare AEs showed dose and time dependent anti-Blastocystis activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
