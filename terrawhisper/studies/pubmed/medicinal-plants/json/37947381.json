However, there are few dual detection probes for hypochlorous acid and butyrylcholinesterase. In addition, single-response probes suffer from serious off-target effects and near-infrared probes do not easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier due to their excessive molecular weight. In this work, we constructed a two-photon fluorescent probe that recognizes hypochlorous acid and butyrylcholinesterase based on a dual-lock strategy. The thiocarbonyl group is oxidized in the presence of hypochlorous acid, and the hydrolysis occurs at the 7-position ester bond in the existence of butyrylcholinesterase, releasing a strongly fluorescent fluorophore, 4-methylumbelliferone. Excellent imaging was performed in PC12 cells using this probe, and deep two-photon imaging was observed in the brains of AD mice after tail vein injection with this probe. It indicates that the probe can provide a promising tool for the more precise diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
