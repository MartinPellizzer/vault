All of them are dimers or tetramers made up of dimers. Dimerization involves side-by-side or back-to-back association of the flat six-membered beta-sheets in the protomers. Variations within these modes of dimerization can be satisfactorily described in terms of angles defining the mutual disposition of the two subunits. In all tetrameric lectins, except peanut lectin, oligomerization involves the back-to-back association of side-by-side dimers. An attempt has been made to rationalize the observed modes of oligomerization in terms of hydrophobic surface area buried on association, interaction energy and shape complementarity, by constructing energy minimised models in each of which the subunit of one legume lectin is fitted in the quaternary structure of another. The results indicate that all the three indices favor and, thus, provide a rationale for the observed arrangements. However, the discrimination provided by buried hydrophobic surface area is marginal in a few instances. The same is true, to a lesser extent, about that provided by shape complementarity. The relative values of interaction energy turns out to be a still better discriminator than the other two indices. Variability in the quaternary association of homologous proteins is a widely observed phenomenon and the present study is relevant to the general problem of protein folding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prabu", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suguna", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vijayan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Proteins", "NlmUniqueID": "8700181", "ISSNLinking": "0887-3585"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biopolymers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biopolymers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Folding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10090286", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0134(19990401)35:1<58::aid-prot6>3.0.co;2-a", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(19990401)35:1<58::AID-PROT6>3.0.CO;2-A"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
