Their structures were elucidated using the HR-ESI-MS and NMR data analyses. The absolute configurations of millefolactons A-G were determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, ECD data analysis, and quantum-chemical ECD calculations. Millefolactons A-E are rare 3-oxa-guaianolides. Millefolacton C, millefolacton E, millefoliumin A and millefoliumin B exhibited enzymatic inhibition of 15-LOX. Molecular docking simulations were conducted to visualize interactions between the four active compounds and 15-LOX and determine binding mechanisms. Moreover, a LPS-induced BV2 cell model was used to further investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of millefolacton C. As a result, millefolacton C significantly inhibited NO release, repressed levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-18, PGE2 and IL-6, and inhibited the protein expression of iNOS and COX2 proteins. In addition, millefolacton C could potently decreased the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1\u03b2 proteins in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. These results indicate that the 3-oxa-guaianolides from A. millefolium L. offer great potential as leads for anti-inflammatory drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
