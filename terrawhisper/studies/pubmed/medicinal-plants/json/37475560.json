Their unique curative effects on bone metabolic diseases and pain diseases have been favoured by the local people in clinical trials for thousands of years. Libanotis buchtormensis (Fisch.) DC. (LBD), is one of the popular Qin herbs, which has been widely used for the treatment of various diseases, such as osteoporosis, rheumatic, and cardiovascular diseases. However, due to the multiple compounds in LBD, the underlying molecular mechanisms of LBD remain unclear.", "This study aimed to systemically investigate the underlying mechanisms of LBD against bone diseases.", "In this study, a systems pharmacology platform included the potential active compound screening, target fishing, and network pharmacological analysis was employed to decipher the action mechanisms of LBD.", "As a result, 12 potential active compounds and 108 targets were obtained. Furthermore, compound-target network and target-pathway network analysis showed that multi-components interacted with multi-targets and multi-pathways, i.e., MARK signalling pathway, mTORC1 signalling pathway, etc., involved in the regulation of the immune system and circulatory system. These results suggested the mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of LBD on various diseases through most compounds targeted by multiple targets.", "In conclusion, we successfully predicted the LBD bioactive compounds and potential targets, implying that LBD could be applied as a novel therapeutic herb in osteoporosis, rheumatic, and cardiovascular diseases. This work provides insight into the therapeutic mechanisms of LBD for treating various diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Rundong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Lifang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "Hu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Jiao", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Haijing", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lab for Bone Metabolism, College of Life Sciences, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Suli", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Endocr Metab Immune Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269157", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5303"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Network Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37475560", "10.2174/1871530323666230720143415", "EMIDDT-EPUB-133044"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
