Miq. ex Havil, Uncaria macrophylla Wall, Uncaria sinensis (Oliv.) Havil, Uncaria hirsuta Havil, and Uncaria sessilifructus Roxb, which belongs to the species widely used in the genus Uncaria. These species resource widely distributed in China and abroad, and the hook-bearing stem is the primary constituent enrichment site. There are many different forms and architectures of chemicals, depending on the extraction site. Traditional remedies employing URCU had been used widely in antiquity and were first compiled in renowned ancient masterpiece 'Mingyi Bielu ()' written by Hongjing Tao. In modern pharmacological studies, both the total extracts and the phytoconstituents isolated from URCU have been shown to have neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial, and autophagy-enhancer properties.", "This review concentrates on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and nanomaterials studies of URCU, with a perspective to assist with further research and advance.", "The Chinese and English literature studies of this review are based on these database searches including Science Direct, CNKI, Wiley online library, Spring Link, Web of Science, PubMed, Medalink, Google scholar, Elsevier, ACS Publications, iPlant, Missouri Botanical Garden, Plant of the World Online. The pertinent data on URCU was gathered.", "Based on the examination of the genus Uncaria, 107 newly marked chemical compositions have been identified from URCU from 2015 to present, including alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, steroids, and others. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that URCU has a variety of benefits in diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and migraine, due to its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. According to metabolic and toxicological studies, the dosage, frequency, and interactions of the drugs that occur in vivo are of great significance for determining whether the organic bodies can perform efficacy or produce toxicity. The research on URCU-mediated nanomaterials is expanding and increasing in order to address the inadequacies of conventional Chinese medicine. The alkaloids in URCU have the capability to self-assemble with other classes of components in addition to being biologically active.", "URCU plants are widely distributed, abundant in chemical constituents, and widely used in both traditional and modern medicine for a variety of pharmacological effects. The utilization of herbal medicines can be raised by assessing the pharmacological distinctions among several species within the same genus and may accelerate the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine. Controlling the concentration of drug administration, monitoring metabolic markers, and inventing novel nanotechnologies are effective strategies for synergistic influence and detoxification to alleviate the main obstacles that toxicity, low bioavailability, and poor permeability. This review can assist further research and advances."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
