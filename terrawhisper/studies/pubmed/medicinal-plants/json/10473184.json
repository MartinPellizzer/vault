A preliminary screening of acetone and water plant extracts against a drug-sensitive strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, H37Rv, was done by the agar plate method. Fourteen of the 20 acetone extracts showed inhibitory activity at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml against this strain. Acetone as well as water extracts of Cryptocarya latifolia, Euclea natalensis, Helichrysum melanacme, Nidorella anomala and Thymus vulgaris inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis. Given the activity of 14 acetone extracts at 0.5 mg/ml against the drug-sensitive strain by the agar plate method, a further study was done employing a rapid radiometric method to confirm the inhibitory activity. These active acetone extracts were screened against the H37Rv strain as well as a strain resistant to the drugs isoniazid and rifampin. The minimal inhibitory concentration of Croton pseudopulchellus, Ekebergia capensis, Euclea natalensis, Nidorella anomala and Polygala myrtifolia was 0.1 mg/ml against the H37Rv strain by the radiometric method. Extracts of Chenopodium ambrosioides, Ekebergia capensis, Euclea natalensis, Helichrysum melanacme, Nidorella anomala and Polygala myrtifolia were active against the resistant strain at 0.1 mg/ml. Eight plants showed activity against both strains at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Pretoria, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lall", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meyer", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V83O1VOZ8L", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoniazid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VJT6J7R4TR", "NameOfSubstance": "Rifampin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoniazid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rifampin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10473184", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00185-8", "S0378874198001858"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
