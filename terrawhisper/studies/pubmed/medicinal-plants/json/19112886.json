The results showed that the medicinal materials were more excellent as the collecting period postponed, the quality of main stem from three year old was better than those of youngers or first and second branch, such as the index of aridity,the color,the mineral content,the maceration extract content and airflow trait. Stems collected in the Mid-November were observably better than those in the March, May, July and Mid-September. Fruits collected on the first day of September were more excellent than those in July, August and October. The processing technology of the stem and fruit was consisted of harvest and drying. The quality and character presented no difference after arid or drying at 60 degrees C temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Hunan University of Arts and Sciences, Changde 415000, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Da-sheng", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xiong", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Wu-jun", "Initials": "WJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Zhong-liang", "Initials": "ZL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19112886"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
