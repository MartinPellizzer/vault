They are considered the most structurally diversified and abundant of all natural compounds. Several studies have shown the application of terpenes, such as carvacrol, linalool, and limonene in many pharmaceutical and medicinal fields, including cardiovascular disorders, the leading cause of death worldwide.", "In this review, the authors outlined patents from the last 10 years relating to the therapeutic application of terpenes for the treatment and/or prevention of cardiovascular diseases found in different databases, emphasizing the possibility of these compounds becoming new drugs that may help to decrease the burden of these disorders.", "There has been a growing awareness over recent years of the therapeutic use of terpenes and their derivatives as new pharmaceutical products. Patents involving the use of terpenes have been especially important in the technological development of new strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases by bringing new scientific knowledge into the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, the development of biotechnologies using natural products should be encouraged in order to increase the variety of drugs available for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1362-1298"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Eric Aian P", "Initials": "EAP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carvalho", "ForeName": "J\u00e9ssica S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1643-5642"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Health Education , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Guimar\u00e3es", "ForeName": "Adriana G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2762-4246"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Health Education , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barreto", "ForeName": "Rosana de S S", "Initials": "RSS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Santos", "ForeName": "M\u00e1rcio R V", "Initials": "MRV"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3183-0966"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Health Education , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Barreto", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9 S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5155-938X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Physiology , Federal University of Sergipe , Sergipe , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Quintans-J\u00fanior", "ForeName": "Lucindo J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30583706", "10.1080/13543776.2019.1558211"]}}]}
