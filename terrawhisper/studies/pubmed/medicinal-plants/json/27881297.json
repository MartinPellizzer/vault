This study was designed to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation on biomarkers of oxidative stress, inflammation and pregnancy outcomes in women with GDM.", "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 60 patients with GDM who were not taking oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients were randomly allocated to intake either 1000\u2009mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil plus 400\u2009IU vitamin E supplements (n=30) or placebo (n=30) for 6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained from the women at the beginning of the study and after the 6-week intervention to quantify related markers.", "After 6 weeks of intervention, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation, compared with the placebo, resulted in a significant rise in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (+187.5\u00b1224.9 vs. -32.5\u00b1136.1\u2009mmol/L; p<0.001); nitric oxide (NO) (+5.0\u00b17.7 vs. -12.0\u00b128.0\u2009\u00b5mol/L; p=0.002) and a significant decrease in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (-0.1\u00b10.9 vs. +0.6\u00b11.4\u2009\u00b5mol/L; p=0.03). Co-supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E showed no detectable changes in plasma glutathione and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Joint omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E supplementation resulted in lower incidences of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns (10.3% vs. 33.3%; p=0.03).", "Overall, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E co-supplementation for 6 weeks in women with GDM had beneficial effects on plasma TAC, MDA and NO and on the incidence of the newborns' hyperbilirubinemia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Canadian Diabetes Association.
