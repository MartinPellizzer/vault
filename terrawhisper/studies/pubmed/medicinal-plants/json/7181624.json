The planting site was located at 90 degrees longitude and 15 degrees latitude, and 250 meters above sea level, in a hot-humid environment. Sowing was performed in the middle of November, under continuous irrigation until April. During the growth period no diseases or major pests were observed. At the initiation of harvesting in February, there were differences among varieties regarding time to reach maturity. The most promising varieties were Thailand, TPT 1, UPS 121 and Indonesia 1 with respect to seed yield. The highest protein value, 36.5%, corresponded to TPT 1, and the lowest value, 31.7% to UPS 62. Oil content in seeds of all varieties ranged from 14.0% to 19.2%. The five higher protein content varieties were analyzed for their amino acid content, and all varieties for their trypsin inhibitor activity. Leaves, roots and threshed mature pods were also analyzed for their protein content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jarqu\u00edn", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Quezada", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "G\u00f3mez-Brenes", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Prueba preliminar del cultivo de frijol alado (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) en Guatemala y variaci\u00f3n en composici\u00f3n qu\u00edmica."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guatemala"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7181624"]}}]}
