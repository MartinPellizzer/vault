Aim. The effect of the ethanol extract of Justicea carnea (JC) leaves in phenylhydrazine induced-anemia albino rats on haematological and lipid profile parameters was investigated.", "The experimental animals were randomly grouped into five groups of six rats each &ndash; group 1 (non-anemic control), group 2 (anemic control), group 3 (500 mg/kg of JC extract), group 4 (1000 mg/kg of JC extract) and group 5 (DMSO control). Phenylhydrazine was administered once at a dose of 80 mg/kg b.w.&nbsp; to induce hemolytic anemia. After 28 days of extract administration, they were humanely sacrificed and the serum collected was used for biochemical analysis.", "In the acute toxicity study, the LD50 was found to be above 5000 mg/kg body weight. Packed Cell Volume (PCV) values, Red Blood cell (RBC) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations decreased (p < 0.05) sig- nificantly after 48 hours of phenylhydrazine induction, but after 28 days of administering extracts of Justicia carnea, PCV values, RBC and Hb increased (p < 0.05) significantly. There were significant (p < 0.05) de- creases in cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the extract-administered groups (groups 3&4) relative to the anemic control. There was a significant (p < 0.05) increase in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in the extract groups (3&4) relative to the non-anemic control.", "Extracts of Justicia carnea not only reversed anemic conditions in the phenylhydrazine-induced rats, it also improved the lipid profile, and this may be attributed to its rich phytochemical, nutrient and vita- min composition. Therefore, the findings of the study suggest that J. carnea leaves could be used to manage lipid abnormalities associated with anemia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Onyeabo", "ForeName": "Chimaraoke", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Achi", "ForeName": "Ngozi K", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry/Biochemistry, Federal University Ndufu-Alike Ikwo, Ebonyi State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ekeleme-Egedigwe", "ForeName": "Chima A", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ebere", "ForeName": "Chidinma U", "Initials": "CU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Okoro", "ForeName": "Chidinma K", "Initials": "CK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Sci Pol Technol Aliment", "NlmUniqueID": "101295615", "ISSNLinking": "1644-0730"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hemoglobins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "064F424C9K", "NameOfSubstance": "phenylhydrazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia, Iron-Deficiency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematocrit"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hemoglobins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Justicia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylhydrazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28703962", "10.17306/J.AFS.0492"]}}]}
