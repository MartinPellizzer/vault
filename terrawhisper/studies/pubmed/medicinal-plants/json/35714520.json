Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) has been regarded as one of the most efficient nanoparticles for their enhanced photocatalytic activity. Medicinal plants are the safe sources to provide green template for biosynthesis of inorganic nanoparticles such as quantum dots. In order to determine the photocatalytic and biological application of cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs), a biosynthesis approach was employed using saffron (<i>Crocus sativus L.</i>) stigma extract as the green reaction substrate. The biosynthesis process was evaluated at different pH condition to obtain the most efficient CdS QDs. Characterization of prepared CdS QDs were determined through UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, FTIR and TEM analysis. The obtained results showed well dsispersed and uniform QDs during green synthesis at the optimum condition. The absorption and electrical properties of green synthesized CdS QDs showed the lowest energy bandgap of 2.4 at pH 11. Photocatalytic activity of CdS QDs on Rhodamine B degradation showed 92% degradation after 80 min under UV light irradiation. The antibacterial and cell cytotoxicity of green synthesized CdS QDs were assayed by disk diffusion and MTT assays respectively. Obtained results showed significant antibacterial effect of CdS QDs against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including<i>B. subtilis</i>(90%) and<i>E. coli</i>(96%) respectively. Moreover, cytotoxicity of prepared CdS Qds through MTT assay indicated 79% apoptosis induction on MCF-7 breast cancer cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6016-5988"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dadmehr", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, College of Agriculture & Natural Resources, University of Tehran, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Korouzhdehi", "ForeName": "Behnaz", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tavassoli", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malekkiani", "ForeName": "Mitra", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nanotechnology", "NlmUniqueID": "101241272", "ISSNLinking": "0957-4484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "057EZR4Z7Q", "NameOfSubstance": "cadmium sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quantum Dots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "21"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35714520", "10.1088/1361-6528/ac79bc"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
