However, due to the multiple compounds in RRL, the underlying molecular mechanisms of RRL are remained unclear. To decipher the action mechanisms of RRL from a systematic perspective, a systems pharmacology approach integrated absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) system, drug targeting, and network analysis was introduced. First, by the ADME screening system and the target fishing process, 56 potential active compounds and 62 targets were obtained, respectively. In addition, compound-target network demonstrated that most compounds interacted with multiple targets, indicating that RRL may enhance its therapeutic effects probably through hitting on multiple targets in a holistic level. Moreover, target-pathway network and gene ontology analysis showed that multiple targets of RRL were involved in several biological pathways, i.e. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, and VEGF signaling pathway, which dissecting the therapeutic effects of RRL on various diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, depression, adaptation diseases, etc. In summary, this work successfully explains the potential active compounds and the multi-scale curative action mechanisms of RRL for treating various diseases; meanwhile, it implies that RRL could be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in arthritic diseases. Most importantly, this work provides an in silico strategy to understand the action mechanisms of herbal medicines from molecular/system levels, which will promote the new drug development of traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3292-2670"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lab for Bone Metabolism, Key Lab for Space Biosciences and Biotechnology, Research Center for Special Medicine and Health Systems Engineering, NPU-UAB Joint Laboratory for Bone Metabolism, School of Life Sciences , Northwestern Polytechnical University , Xi'an , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1290-6427"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lab for Bone Metabolism, Key Lab for Space Biosciences and Biotechnology, Research Center for Special Medicine and Health Systems Engineering, NPU-UAB Joint Laboratory for Bone Metabolism, School of Life Sciences , Northwestern Polytechnical University , Xi'an , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Huai", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lab for Bone Metabolism, Key Lab for Space Biosciences and Biotechnology, Research Center for Special Medicine and Health Systems Engineering, NPU-UAB Joint Laboratory for Bone Metabolism, School of Life Sciences , Northwestern Polytechnical University , Xi'an , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Miao", "ForeName": "Zhiping", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Clinical Laboratory of Honghui Hospital , Xi'an JiaoTong University College of Medicine , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chu", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Zoology Department, Faculty of Science , Tanta University , Tanta , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Shahen", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d College of Life Sciences , Northwest A & F University , Yangling , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Siddiq Ur", "Initials": "SU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Poultry, Faculty of Agriculture , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Alagawany", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Poultry, Faculty of Agriculture , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Hack", "ForeName": "Mohamed E Abd", "Initials": "MEA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Clinical Laboratory of Honghui Hospital , Xi'an JiaoTong University College of Medicine , Xi'an , Shaanxi , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Heping", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Lab for Bone Metabolism, Key Lab for Space Biosciences and Biotechnology, Research Center for Special Medicine and Health Systems Engineering, NPU-UAB Joint Laboratory for Bone Metabolism, School of Life Sciences , Northwestern Polytechnical University , Xi'an , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Airong", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Drug Dev Ind Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7802620", "ISSNLinking": "0363-9045"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30449200", "10.1080/03639045.2018.1546316"]}}]}
