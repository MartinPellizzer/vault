Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energies analysis provided an effective approach to reveal mechanism on conformational calculation. In this work, the insecticidal and repellent capacities of Praxelis clematidea and Ageratum houstonianum oils and their main components identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were scientifically measured. Interestingly, P. clematidea oil exhibited strong fumigant toxicity against Tribolium castaneum (LC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a07.07\u00a0mg/L air). Moreover, two EOs exhibited over 80% repellent rate against T. castaneum at the highest concentration of 78.63\u00a0nL/cm<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, hundreds of enzymes related to the regulation of biological processes of T. castaneum were screened to explore the underlying molecular mechanism and develop promising insecticides. Besides, top hits were subjected to MD simulations and binding free energies analysis to elucidate complex inter-molecular stability and affinity over simulated time. The results demonstrated that isolongifolene, \u03b4-cadinene, \u03b2-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were prioritized as they were establishing conserved and stable interactions with residues of nuclear hormone receptor 3 (TcHR3) of T. castaneum, which suggested that the four sesquiterpenes have potential to be promising insecticides on storage pests control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
