However, there is still lacking relevant information about its dissipation under different vegetation for remediation purposes. In the present study, evaluation of dissipation of CP and TCP in non-planted and planted soil with different cultivars of three types of aromatic grass viz Cymbopogon martinii (Roxb. Wats), Cymbopogon flexuosus, and Chrysopogon zizaniodes (L.) Nash was examined in light of soil enzyme kinetics, microbial communities, and root exudation. Results revealed that the dissipation of CP was well-fitted into a single first-order exponential model (SFO). A significant reduction in the half-life (DT<sub>50</sub>) of CP was observed in planted soil (30-63\u00a0days) than in non-planted soil (95 days). The presence of TCP in all soil samples was observed. The three types of the inhibitory effect of CP i.e. linear mixed inhibition (increase in enzyme-substrate affinity (Km) and decrease in enzyme pool (Vmax), un-competitive inhibition (decrease in Km and Vmax), and simple competitive inhibition were observed on soil enzymes involved in mineralization of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. The improvement in the enzyme pool (Vmax) was observed in planted soil. Streptomyces, Clostridium, Kaistobacter, Planctomyces, and Bacillus were the dominant genera in CP stress soil. CP contamination in soil demonstrated a reduction of richness in microbial diversity and enhancement of functional gene family related to cellular process, metabolism, genetic, and environmental information processing. Among all the cultivars, C. flexuosus cultivars demonstrated a higher dissipation rate of CP along with more root exudation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
