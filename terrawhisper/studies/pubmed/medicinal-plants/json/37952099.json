Notably, the Papaveraceae family includes well-known species, such as Papaver somniferum and Chelidonium majus, which possess medicinal properties due to their latex content. Latex-bearing plants are a rich source of diverse bioactive compounds, with applications ranging from narcotics to analgesics and relaxants. With the advent of high-throughput technologies and advancements in sequencing tools, an opportunity exists to bridge the knowledge gap between the genetic information of herbs and the regulatory networks underlying their medicinal activities. This emerging discipline, known as herbgenomics, combines genomic information with other -omics studies to unravel the genetic foundations, including essential gene functions and secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, exploring the genomes of various medicinal plants enables the utilization of modern genetic manipulation techniques, such as Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) or RNA interference. This technological revolution has facilitated systematic studies of model herbs, targeted breeding of medicinal plants, the establishment of gene banks and the adoption of synthetic biology approaches. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic research on species within the Papaveraceae family. Additionally, it briefly explores the potential applications and key opportunities offered by the -omics perspective in the pharmaceutical industry and the agrobiotechnology field."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
