Herein, we report a new molecular targeted drug oHA-GX1 constructed by oligomeric hyaluronan (oHA) and peptide GX1 (CGNSNPKSC). The oHA-GX1 can not only suppress the tumor growth by interacting with overexpressed VEGF and CD44 receptors inside tumor tissues, but also reduce the likelihood of off-target toxicity due to the multiple VEGF and CD44 receptors binding sites. The cytotoxicity study shows that the IC<sub>50</sub><sup>oHA-GX1</sup> against co-SGC-7901 and co-HUVEC cells fell in the range of common cytotoxic drugs. The animal experiment results reveal that the tumor inhibition rate of oHA-GX1 (100\u00a0mg/kg) against SGC-7901 tumor-bearing mice were 78.4\u00a0%, which was comparable to that of front-line chemotherapy drugs. Also, the cytotoxicity study on normal cells, hemolysis test, hemagglutination assay and the acute toxicity test demonstrate that oHA-GX1 exhibited excellent biosafety. This molecular targeted drug that utilizes the multiple receptor-binding sites to get rid of the side effects caused by off-target paves a new direction for the discovery of anticancer drugs with high efficacy and low adverse effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
