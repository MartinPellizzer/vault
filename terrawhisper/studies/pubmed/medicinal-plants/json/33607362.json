Their structures were elucidated by interpretation of their spectroscopic data (1D and 2D NMR, UV, IR, CD, and HRESIMS) and comparison to literature data. In the in vitro assay, 21 showed anti-proliferative activity against human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Studies of its mechanism revealed that 21 could significantly activate autophagic flux and trigger ROS release in HepG2 cells. Western blot experiments demonstrated that 21 could activate the key signaling protein of autophagy and ROS, while it does not affect the main protein of the apoptosis signaling pathway. These results suggested that 21 mediates its anti-proliferative effects through autophagic cell death, which is apoptosis-independent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
