Considering both traditional and modern literature, the aim of this study is to present a review of its biological activities.", "Using online databases (e.g. PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) as well as reviewing traditional medicinal literature (e.g. Makhzan-ul-Adwiah, Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb); we reviewed the published literature on the pharmacological effects of Laricifomes officinalis (the most common species considered as \"Gharikon\").", "Laricifomes officinalis (Polyporus officinalis) is a wood-rotting fungus that grows on different hosts such as conifers. The mushroom is native to Europe, Asia, and North America. According to the judgment of traditional medicine, its temperament is warm and dry. It has been used since the ancient times to treat sciatica, weakness of muscles, bronchitis, constipation, stomach and uterus pain, jaundice, fever and insect bites. It also has diuretic and emmenagogue effects. In recent decades, several research studies have been performed on L. officinalis. The results showed that the biological effects of L. officinalis are anti-viral (especially against smallpox, H5N1 influenza, and hepatitis C virus), anti-tuberculosis, boosting the immune system, treating dysmenorrhea, hemorrhoids, cough, rheumatoid arthritis and anticoagulant activity. A survey revealed that L. officinalis is a well-known medicinal mushroom with some formulations as dietary supplements on the market.", "Considering traditional literature and recent findings on biological activities that in most cases corroborate each other, it seems that Laricifomes officinalis needs more attention in new investigations, including more pharmacologic assays and clinical trials, which may lead to the development of new natural products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vazirian", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faridfar", "ForeName": "Shabnam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Eftekhari", "ForeName": "Mahdieh", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8104374", "ISSNLinking": "0253-0716"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27840500", "PMC5103541"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
