Thus, the inhibitory effects on human erythroleukemia cells (HEL) were applied to guide the isolation of the anti-leukemic compounds from Aglaia abbreviata. As a result, 19 compounds (16 steroids, two phenol derivatives, and a rare C12 chain nor-sesquiterpenoid), including 13 new compounds, were isolated and identified based on spectroscopic data analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction data, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. Among them, 9 steroids exhibited good selective anti-leukemic activity against HEL and K562 (human chronic myeloid leukemia cells) cells with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 2.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18\u00a0\u03bcM and 19.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13\u00a0\u03bcM. Notably, all the active compounds had relatively lower toxicity on the normal human liver cell line (HL-7702). Furthermore, five compounds (1, 4, 8, 10, and 19) displayed good anti-inflammatory effects, with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 7.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 and 27.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37\u00a0\u03bcM. An \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone or a <sup>5,6</sup>\u0394 double bond was crucial for improving anti-leukemic effect from the structure-activity relationship analysis. The compound with the most potential, 14 was selected for the preliminary mechanistic study. Compound 14 can induce apoptosis and cause cell cycle arrest. The expression of the marker proteins, such as PARP and caspase 3, were notably effected by this compound, thus inducing apoptosis. In conclusion, our investigation implied that compound 14 may serve as a potential anti-leukemia agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
