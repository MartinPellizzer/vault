Of the various seedling explants, cotyledonary node exhibited maximum shoot regeneration frequency from axillary region on MS medium supplemented with 5 microM BAP. Addition of 0.1 microM NAA enhanced the efficacy of BAP for multiple shoot regeneration as well as improved the growth of shoots. BAP (5 microM) in combination with NAA (0.1 microM) was found to be the optimal for inducing an average of 4-5 shoots per explant in 75% of the cultures within 5 weeks. Replacement of BAP with other cytokinins at equimolar concentration of BAP i.e. 5 microM was not effective in inducing multiple shoots. Regenerated shoots were rooted on MS medium containing IBA (8 microM) with 80% efficiency. The plantlets were successfully established in soil where 80% of them developed into morphological normal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, M.D. University, Rohtak 124001, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saini", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaiwal", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11272417"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
