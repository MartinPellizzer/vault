A series of mechanistic control experiments were also conducted, indicating that the copper catalyst selectively coordinates with the nitrogen moiety of the tryptamine to initiate the oxidation, and a nucleophilic-alkylation process is proposed for the carbon-carbon bond-forming in the reaction. The novel synthetic strategies and molecular skeletons outlined in this work provide new ideas and concepts for the design of other useful reaction and potential drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1299-9267"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University;
