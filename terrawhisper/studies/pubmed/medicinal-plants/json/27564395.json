Data were systematically collected from published papers about the efficacy of herbs used against T. gondii globally from 1988 to 2015, from PubMed, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science, EBSCO, Science Direct, and Scopus. Forty-nine papers were included in the current systematic review reporting the evaluation of medicinal plants against T. gondii globally, both in vitro and in vivo. Sixty-one plants were evaluated. Most of the studies were carried out on Artemisia annua. The second highest number of studies were carried out on Glycyrrhiza glabra extracts. RH and ME49 were the predominant parasite strains used. Additionally, Swiss-Webster and BALB/c mice were the major animal models used. Alcoholic and aqueous extracts were used more than other types of extracts. Natural compounds mentioned here may be developed as novel and more effective therapeutic agents that improve the treatment of toxoplasmosis due to their lower side effects, higher availability, and better cultural acceptance compared with those of the chemical drugs that are currently being used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharif", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sarvi", "ForeName": "Shahabeddin", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pagheh", "ForeName": "Abdol Sattar", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asfaram", "ForeName": "Shabnam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehrzadi", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Infectious and Tropical Diseases Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadpour", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholami", "ForeName": "Shirzad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Toxoplasmosis Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Parasitology and Mycology, Sari Medical School, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Daryani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372712", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4212"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Toxoplasma"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Toxoplasmosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27564395", "10.1139/cjpp-2016-0039"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
