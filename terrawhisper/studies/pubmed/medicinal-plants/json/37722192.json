This study aims to investigate whether PhGs treatment improves the stroke and its potential mechanisms. Adult male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were administrated PhGs once daily for 7 days after MCAO surgery. The neurological score, and catwalk were evaluated on Day 1, 3 and 7 after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, triphenyl-2,3,5-tetrazoliumchloride (TTC) and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining were used for evaluating the infarct volume and neuronal restoration. The effects of PhGs on NSCs proliferation were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Western blot was used to detect the proteins of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. This study found that PhGs effectively improved the neurological functions in ischemic stroke mice. TTC and H&E staining demonstrated that PhGs not only reduced infarct volume, but also improved neuronal restoration. The immunohistochemistry and 5-Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays revealed that PhGs promoted the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in subventricular zone (SVZ). In addition, transcriptome analysis of NSCs showed that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was involved in the PhGs induced NSCs proliferation. Importantly, the related proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were changed after PhGs treatment, including \u03b2-catenin, Wnt3a, GSK-3\u03b2, c-Myc. PhGs treatment improved the stroke through enhancing endogenous NSCs proliferation via activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Due to its effect on the proliferation of NSCs, PhGs are a potential adjuvant therapeutic drug for post-stroke treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
