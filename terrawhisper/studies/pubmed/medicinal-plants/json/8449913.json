The purification procedure combined conventional chromatographic methods and cosubstrate affinity chromatography on alpha-ketoglutarate-Sepharose. The specific activity of the 4-hydroxylase was enriched over 2000-fold compared to the crude homogenate with a recovery of 1.6%. The molecular mass of the native and denatured 4-hydroxylase was found to be 45 and 44.7 kDa, respectively, suggesting that the native enzyme is a monomer. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing under denaturing conditions resolved the purified 4-hydroxylase into three charge isoforms of pI values 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8. The enzyme did not require most divalent cations, but inactive enzyme was reactivated in a time-dependent manner by incubation with ferrous ions. The mechanism of action of desacetoxyvindoline 4-hydroxylase was investigated. The results of substrate interaction kinetics and product inhibition studies suggest an Ordered Ter Ter mechanism where 2-oxoglutarate is the first substrate to bind followed by the binding of O2 and desacetoxyvindoline. The first product to be released was deacetylvindoline followed by CO2 and succinate, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement de Sciences Biologiques, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada."}], "LastName": "De Carolis", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Luca", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "571PJ1LW03", "NameOfSubstance": "vindoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5V9KLZ54CY", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinblastine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E1UOL152H7", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.11.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CRSD4H protein, Catharanthus roseus"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Iron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mixed Function Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Vinblastine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8449913", "S0021-9258(18)53349-4"]}}]}
