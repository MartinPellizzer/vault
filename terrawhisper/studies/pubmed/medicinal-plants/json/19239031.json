The isolation and purification were performed by various chromatographies such as silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, RP-C18 column chromatography and so on. Based on the spectral analysis such as NMR, MS, etc., seven 2-arylbenzofuran derivatives were identified as wittifuran D (1), wittifuran E (2), moracin C (3), moracin M (4), moracin P (5), 2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,6-dihydroxybenzofuran (6) and mulberroside C (7). Compounds 1-7 were isolated from this plant for the first time. Among them, 1 and 2 were new compounds. Compounds 3-7 were used to assay antioxidant activity, the inhibitory ratios of compounds 3, 4, 6, at a concentration of 1 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1), to malondialdehyde (MDA) produced during microsomal lipid peroxidation induced by ferrous-cysteine were 73%, 69% and 89% respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Yong-Xia", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ruo-Yun", "Initials": "RY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzofurans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "moracin C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "moracin P"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzofurans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19239031"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
