However, due to high structural similarity and high polarity, the characterization of monosaccharide isomers, disaccharide isomers, as well as the analysis of monosaccharide composition of polysaccharides by a method that does not require derivatization is an ongoing challenge. Herein, we proposed a simple method for rapid discrimination of non-derivatized neutral monosaccharide, and disaccharide isomers using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HILIC-Q/TOF-MS). In this work, we optimized the experimental parameters, and detailed approaches to discriminate the precursor ions, deprotonated ions, and fragment ions are proposed, as well. To discriminate the various ions, the retention times, the relative abundance (RA) of precursor ions and fragment ions at different collision energies, the relative abundance ratio (RAR) of fragment ions to deprotonated ions or precursor ions were considered for characterization of neutral monosaccharide and disaccharide isomers. Finally, this strategy was successfully applied to analyzing the monosaccharide composition of neutral disaccharides, polysaccharides, and an aqueous extract of Moringa oleifera seeds. The experimental results revealed that the HILIC-Q/TOF-MS is an effective and convenient strategy for rapid differentiation of monosaccharide isomers and disaccharide isomers, which may serve as a general platform for the analysis of neutral polysaccharides, food, medicinal plants, and herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
