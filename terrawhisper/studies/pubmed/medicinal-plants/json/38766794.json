Although surgical, hormonal, and analgesic treatment relieves symptoms and improves fertility, it is associated with side effects and a high recurrence rate. Alternative medicines like medicinal plants have been used for the treatment of chronic diseases. Given the global importance of endometriosis as a chronic disease affecting over 15% of all women in their fertile period, this systematic review aimed to give a comprehensive view of research on medicinal plants.", "Comprehensive searches were performed on three databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection (Indexes = SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, A, and HCI Timespan), and Scopus, to identify papers published until June 2023. Keywords, such as \"Endometriosis\" and \"Herbal Medicine\", were used to search. A manual search of valid journals followed by a manual search of the references of the retrieved full-text articles was performed. All retrieved articles were imported into a database into Endnote X9. Articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study, and the full texts of all the articles that met the inclusion criteria were assessed. Studies that evaluated the effects of herbal compounds on various aspects of endometriosis treatment were included in the review.", "In total, 11 studies were included in the present study. The evidence showed that in addition to safety, drugs available alongside treatments could play an effective role in improving the symptoms associated with endometriosis. In this study, the positive results of using Chinese treatments were reported in aspects such as fertility rate, pain, endometriosis recurrence rate, quality of life, sexual function, CA-125 level, and menopause symptoms.", "A wide range of preclinical and clinical studies evaluated the effectiveness and safety of medicinal plants in the treatment of endometriosis symptoms. Thus, alternative treatments for endometriosis with no or low side effects should be included in the holistic treatment of endometriosis upfront. However, there is still a need for well-designed trials to investigate standard interventions and specific and safe doses of herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproductive Health Department, Qom University of Medical Sciences, Qom, Iran. ibrahim.alkatout@uksh.de."}], "LastName": "Momenimovahed", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salehiniya", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Allahqoli", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lagan\u00e0", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mazidimoradi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moawad", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gitas", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alkatout", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Italy", "MedlineTA": "Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9717360", "ISSNLinking": "1128-3602"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Endometriosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38766794", "10.26355/eurrev_202405_36182", "36182"]}}]}
