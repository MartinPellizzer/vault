Many people acquire the habit of chewing betel quid due to its physiological effects, including increased stamina and a general feeling of well-being. In this study, a sympathetic model system of adrenal chromaffin cells and sensory evaluation were used to examine the physiological effects of betel quid and the interaction of all the ingredients (areca fruit, Piper betle inflorescence and red time paste) in betel quid. Physiological effects of cardioacceleration, a slightly drunk feeling, sweating and salivation occurred during the chewing of betel quid (a mixture of areca fruit, Piper betle inflorescence and red lime paste) and a mixture of areca fruit and red lime paste. Both induced much more basal catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells than did other ingredients and combinations of ingredients. It was evident that the responses in the sympathetic model system were closely correlated with the physiological feeling of well-being. The inhibitory effects of all the chewing juices on catecholamine secretion evoked by carbachol and a high concentration of potassium (high K+) showed that they perhaps affected the calcium influx through voltage-sensitive channels or the steps involved in secretion after calcium entry to stimulate basal catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Nutritional Science, Chung Shan Medical and Dental College, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. wck@mercury.csmc.edu.tw"}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hwang", "ForeName": "L S", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catecholamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Glands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catecholamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chromaffin Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9369022"]}}]}
