Artemisia absinthium (A. absinthium) has been reported to have neuroprotective and antioxidant activities. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of A. absinthium in QAinduced neurotoxicity in OLN-93 Cells.", "OLN-93 cells were cultured in a DMEM medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. The cells were pretreated with concentrations of A. absinthium extract for two h and then exposed to QA for 24 h. After 24 h cell viability, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptotic cells were quantitated in OLN-93 Cells.", "Pretreatment with A. absinthium extract prevented the loss of cell viability in OLN-93 cells. ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, and apoptosis in QA-injured OLN-93 cells were reduced following A. absinthium extract pretreatment.", "A. absinthium extract exerts its neuroprotective effect against QA-induced neurotoxicity via oxidative stress and apoptosis modulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rashidi", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akaberi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Syndrome Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholoobi", "ForeName": "Aida", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazavi", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Forouzanfar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "F6F0HK1URN", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolinic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia absinthium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36998142", "10.2174/1570163820666230330105331", "CDDT-EPUB-130529"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
