Licorice biodiversity is becoming threatened nowadays in Iran due to increasing demand and a drastic decline of its natural habitats. Therefore, licorice domestication would be necessary in the near future, and molecular breeding would help to introduce genotypes suitable for cultivation. The present study was carried out with 170 individual licorice plants sampled in the wild in 59 localizations in 21 provinces of Iran. The association of 436 polymorphic AFLP markers, produced by 15 primer combinations (EcoRI/MseI), with six phenotypic phytochemical traits was studied. The AMOVA analysis show gene diversity among and within localizations. The population structure analysis identified two main sub-populations with significant genetic variation. Significant associations were identified between three markers (E3/M40-4, E34/M4-12 and E12/M31-15) and glycyrrhizin concentration, and between four markers (E11/M34-12, E11/M34-15, E9/M7-29, and E9/M7-30) and phenolic compounds contents. Markers detected can be useful in the domestication of licorice as well as in breeding programs. Licorice sampled in four localizations (KBA1, KBA2, SKh2 and Fa1) were found to be superior in terms of glycyrrhizin and antioxidants content, and therefore they can be considered as elite genotypes which could be included in the domestication process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
