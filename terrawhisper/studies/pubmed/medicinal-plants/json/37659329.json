However, one challenge in 3D printing food is the limited availability of printable materials that can mimic the properties of real food. This review focused on the various 3DFP methodologies, as well as the reinforcement of natural food gel for improving printing features in 3D printed food. Also covered is the use of hydrogel-based 3D printing in the development of 3D printed food. Different 3D printing techniques can be employed to print hydrogel-based inks, each with its advantages and limitations. 3D printing of food using hydrogel-based inks has potential for customized food products development. In summary, the utilization of hydrogel-based inks in 3D printing offers a promising avenue for the development of customized food products. Although there are still challenges to overcome, such as improving the printability and mechanical properties of hydrogel-based inks, the potential benefits of this technology make it an exciting area of research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
