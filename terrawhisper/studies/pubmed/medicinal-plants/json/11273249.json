Assessment was made with the help of skin prick and bronchial provocation tests (BPT) using a commercially available Pathenium extract. Eleven patients (44%) of the study group had a positive skin reaction and 4 (16%) showed a significant fall in FEV1 and PEFR (p < 0.05) on bronchial provocation. In the control group only one patient (10%) had a positive skin test while there was none with a positive bronchial challenge. There was a significant fall in the mean values of FEV1 and PEFR over base line after the BPT in patients of asthma than controls. It is concluded that a significant proportion of bronchial asthma patients are sensitized to Parthenium hysterophorous and it may act as a cofactor in seasonal exacerbation of their symptoms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh-160012."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suresh", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Behera", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jindal", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Assoc Physicians India", "NlmUniqueID": "7505585", "ISSNLinking": "0004-5772"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Asthma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Spasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chi-Square Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tanacetum parthenium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11273249"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
