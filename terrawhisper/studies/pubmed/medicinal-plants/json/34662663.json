There is as yet no relevant experimental or clinical study in the scientific literature evaluating the efficacy of plants in these disorders.", "To investigate the active ingredients in Erigeron canadensis, a complex isolated from flowering parts of a plant was tested for airway defense reflexes, in particular for cough reflexes and airway reactivity. Both were experimentally induced by a chemical irritant that simulated the inflammatory conditions of their formation.", "The polyphenolic polysaccharide-protein (PPP) complex was isolated from the flowering parts of Erigeron canadensis by hot alkaline extraction and a multi-stage purification process. The antitussive activity was confirmed as a decrease in the number of citric acid-induced coughs and the bronchodilator effect was verified as a decrease in specific airway resistance (sRaw) in conscious guinea pigs.", "The dark brown Erigeron complex with a molecular weight of 38,000\u00a0g/mol contained phenolics (13.2% wt%), proteins (16.3% wt%), and uronic acids (6.3% wt%). The neutral carbohydrate part of Erigeron consisted mainly of xylose (12.1\u00a0wt%), glucose (13.3\u00a0wt%), arabinose (24.1\u00a0wt%), and galactose (41.0\u00a0wt%) residues. Arabinogalactan and 4-OMe-glucuronoxylan have been found to be the major polysaccharides in the Erigeron complex. Using a method of chemically-induced cough reflex and guinea pigs test system the Erigeron complex exhibited statistically significant, the dose-dependent antitussive activity, which was similar to that of the centrally-acting opioid agonist codeine.", "Pharmacological tests have revealed a new pharmacodynamic effect of the Erigeron complex, namely an antitussive effect. Its activity was most pronounced in comparison with all previously tested compounds from other medicinal plants and approached the effect of codeine, the most potent antitussive used in clinical practice. The results provide the scientific basis for the application of this herb in traditional medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
