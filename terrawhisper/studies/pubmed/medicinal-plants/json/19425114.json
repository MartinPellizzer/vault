Principal component analysis and similarity evaluation were employed to analyse the chromatographic dataset.", "The chromatograms of 20 Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, 13 Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride and 15 Fructus Aurantii samples from diverse habitats had 13 peaks in common, and showed one peak characteristic for Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride and two peaks characteristic for Fructus Aurantii. Furthermore, it was possible to differentiate the three medicines by a 'fingerprint region'. The difference between Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Fructus Aurantii was much bigger than that between Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae and Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae Viride, as could be shown by calculation of common peak ratio and variation peak ratio.", "A reliable HPLC fingerprint method coupled with principal component analysis and similarity evaluation was developed and showed substantial differentiation power for the three medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, Shanxi 030006, People's Republic of China. qinxmhao@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Xue-Mei", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Yun-Tao", "Initials": "YT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Zeng", "Initials": "LZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xiao-Qing", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Hong-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E750O06Y6O", "NameOfSubstance": "Hesperidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7TD9J649B", "NameOfSubstance": "naringin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hesperidin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19425114", "10.1002/pca.1128"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
