Tested was the feeding of the silkworm moth on leaves of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale L.) up to the end of the III instar. Feeding was also carried out with dandelion leaves up to the end of the IV instar, which, immediately prior to offering to the moths were sprinkled with water solutions of flurazolidon, 1.5 per cent, chloramphenicol with propylen glycol (5%)--50 cm3 each/1 of water or nalidixic acid, 2.5 per cent. The effect was studied of the antibacterial preparations applied to every kind of feed on the amount of microflora in the alimentary tract. It was found that moths given dandelion leaves reached the III instar, however, there was a very early manifestation of spontaneous nuclear polyhedrosis and bacterial infections of the alimentary tract. The addition of antibacterial preparations reduced the outbreaks of the two diseases and the microflora in silkmoths. Discussed is the possibility of the wide use of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs in the prevention of these diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manchev", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Otglezhdane na koprinenata buba Bombyx mori L s lista ot glukharche (Taraxacum officinale L.)."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bulgaria", "MedlineTA": "Vet Med Nauki", "NlmUniqueID": "0414760", "ISSNLinking": "0324-1068"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "5J9CPU3RE0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furazolidone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66974FR9Q1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloramphenicol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bombyx"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Chloramphenicol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Furazolidone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metamorphosis, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7344277"]}}]}
