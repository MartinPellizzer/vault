In negatively stained preparations of spontaneously infected deadly nightshade, artificially inoculated host plants and purified preparations two types of virus particles, isometric ones of about 26 nm in diameter and flexuous ones with length of 765 nm were seen by electron microscopy. The virus with isometric particles was identified as belladonna mottle virus (BMV), indistinguishable serologically from the Hungarian isolate of this virus. Identification of the virus with flexuous particles is discussed. Observations of the ultrastructure revealed the presence of filamentous virus particle aggregates and chloroplasts with peripheral vesicles bounded by double membranes, a feature typical for tymoviruses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Virology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Cesk\u00e9 Bud\u0115jovice, Czech Republic.
