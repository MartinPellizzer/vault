The signal transduction pathways mainly include the activation of I\u03baB kinase, degradation of I\u03baB protein and the nuclear translocation of p65. p65 trans-nuclear binding with DNA is the key for NF-\u03baB to play a role. Abnormal activation of NF-\u03baB is a major factor in the induction of oxidative stress, inflammation, cancer and so on. Therefore, maintaining the balance of NF-\u03baB activity and regulating the nuclear translocation of p65 have great significance for further research on related subjects. In this paper, the regulation effects of the main active substances of medicinal plants (such as polyphenols, saponins, and alkaloids) on p65 nuclear translocation and the upstream pathway of NF-\u03baB were discussed, expecting to provide reference for the development of natural active substances for functional food."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Qian", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Xiao-Ji", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xin-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory for Rice and By-product Deep Processing, Central South University of Forestry & Technology, Changsha 410004, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RELA protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor RelA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Active Transport, Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "I-kappa B Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor RelA"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29192437", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170731.003"]}}]}
