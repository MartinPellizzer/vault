Through characterization analysis, the outer shell of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@TFN-CDPs has observed coating with a network of the polymer and forming a core-shell structure. Under the optimum conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) and limits of qualification (LOQs) of target pesticides were ranged from 0.011 to 0.106\u00a0\u00b5g Kg<sup>-1</sup> and from 0.036 to 0.354\u00a0\u00b5g Kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Finally, the achieved recoveries of pesticides in six medicinal samples fluctuated from 60.1% to 102.3%. Altogether, this method based on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@TFN-CDPs composites provided a new idea for the analysis of trace pesticides in complicated matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
