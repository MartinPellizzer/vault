The material was used as the host for the electrochemical storage of hydrogen. The hydrogen storage capacity of the material was over 300 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at a rate of 100 mAg<sup>-1</sup>. It also exhibited superior stability for storage of hydrogen, high rate capability, and good cyclic life. Hybridizing metallic cobalt nanoparticle with nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon is found to be a good approach for the electrochemical storage of hydrogen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Lina", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Laboratory of Southwest Endangered Medicinal Resources Development, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants , Nanning 530023, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Xiaosheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee , 3200 North Cramer Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53211, United States."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Haolin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee , 3200 North Cramer Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53211, United States."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee , 3200 North Cramer Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53211, United States."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Deyang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "ZhiZhong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Junsheng", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8514-2646"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Material Synthesis and Processing, Department of Chemistry, School of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Life Sciences, Wuhan University of Technology , 122 Luoshi Road, Wuhan, 430070 Hubei, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Deyu", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "ACS Appl Mater Interfaces", "NlmUniqueID": "101504991", "ISSNLinking": "1944-8244"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29116740", "10.1021/acsami.7b14163"]}}]}
