Then the optimized conditions for purification using cation exchange resin were investigated.", "The optimized conditions in the process of acid water extraction were 1% hydrochloric acid as much as seven times of the medicine amount for 24hs and three times. Then the extraction of acid water was purified with a column of macroporous cation exchange resin LSD001 at 2 ml/min of flow rate, then eluted with 10BV of 4% aqueous ammonia ethanol. The extraction ratio of the total alkaloids was 1. 35% and the content of taspine of the total alkaloids was 6. 80%.", "This technology is simply, cheap effective and feasible for manufacture in great scale."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi' an 710061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi-ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guang-de", "Initials": "GD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Lang-chong", "Initials": "LC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cation Exchange Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cation Exchange Resins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caulophyllum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17571776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
