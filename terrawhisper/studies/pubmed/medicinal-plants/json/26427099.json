These plants are also listed in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India. Har\u012btak\u012b and \u0100malaka have also been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times in Japan under the Japanese names of (see text) (Kariroku) and (see text) (Annmaroku), respectively. Both have been carefully preserved as treasured drugs in the nationally important Shosoin treasure storehouse. This study attempts to clarify the description of Tri-phal\u0101 in the N\u0101van\u012btaka, which is the second part of the Bower Manuscript (Bower Ms.), and examines the reasons why these plants were combined. This paper begins with a summary description of Tri-phal\u0101 in the context of traditional Asian medicine, followed by the delineation of drug selection principles in Ayurveda. Tri-phal\u0101 formulas in the N\u0101van\u012btaka are then examined. The Carakasamhit\u0101 (CS) treats Tri-phal\u0101 as a purifier and tonic (ras\u0101yana), describing it as a formula for rejuvenation and longevity. On the other hand, the Susrutasamhitd (SS) regards Tri-phal\u0101 as having the efficacy of balancing kapha (phlegm) and pitta (bile), and also as being a medicine to promote excretion and enhance digestive functions for better nutritional intake. It is described to have an effect of curing diseases by keeping the tridh\u0101u (theree element) valance. Tri-phal\u0101 is thus used as an ingredient of laxatives for diseases that result from kapha imbalance and tonic. The A\u015f\u0163\u0101ngah\u0157dayasamhit\u0101 (AHS) considers Tri-phal\u0101 to have a particular superiority among cure-all medicines with the power to dispel illness. It controls kapha and overcomes blood diseases. Tri-phal\u0101 formulas found in the N\u0101van\u012btaka were prescribed for the treatment of abdominal tumors induced by v\u0101yu (wind) disorder as well as for coughs caused by pitta and kapha disorder. Tri-phal\u0101 was also administered to facilitate nutrient absorption, regulate bowel function, and promote excretion. Tri-phal\u0101 thus restores the balance of tridh\u0101u by facilitating water distribution in the body. For these reasons, the optimal combination of Tri-phal\u0101 was then established to adjust kapha for most efficient purification effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Natsume", "ForeName": "Yohko", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26427099"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
