The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present at low concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kivilompolo", "ForeName": "Maarit", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ob\u016frka", "ForeName": "V\u00edt", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hy\u00f6tyl\u00e4inen", "ForeName": "Tuulia", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17468851", "10.1007/s00216-007-1298-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
