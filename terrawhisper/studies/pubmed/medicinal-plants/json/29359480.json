Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups to take either 1000 mg omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil (n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) twice a day for 12 weeks. Gene expression related to insulin, lipid and inflammation was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of PCOS women with RT-PCR method.", "Our study demonstrated that after the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, fish oil supplementation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) (P < .001) in PBMC of subjects with PCOS. In addition, compared to the placebo, taking fish oil supplements downregulated gene expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (P = .02) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) (P = .01) in PBMC of subjects with PCOS. We did not observe any significant effect of fish oil supplementation on gene expression of lipoprotein(a) [LP(a)], low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) in PBMC of subjects with PCOS.", "Overall, fish oil supplementation for 12 weeks to subjects with PCOS significantly improved gene expression of PPAR-\u03b3, IL-1 and IL-8, but did not influence gene expression of LP(a), LDLR, GLUT-1, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Stichting
