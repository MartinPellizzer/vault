The edition which is currently in force, the XIth (2012), comprises two plant lists drawn up by a working group of experts belonging to the ANSM: List A (medicinal plants traditionally used [365\u00a0plants]) and list B (medicinal plants with the ratio benefit/risk's evaluation negative [123\u00a0plants]). Moreover, a list of medicinal plants with non exclusive therapeutic use has been established. This last list is composed of 147\u00a0plants which are thus liberated from the pharmaceutical monopoly, in application of decrees n(o)\u00a02008-839\u00a0and 2008-841\u00a0dated August 22nd 2008. Medicinal plants are a matter, in France, from pharmaceutical monopoly, which means that they can only be dispensed to public in pharmacy, according to article L. 4211-1/5\u00b0 of the Public Health Code, except however for a certain number of plants \"liberated\" from this monopoly. Nevertheless, besides officinal pharmacists, herbalists who obtained their diploma as far as 1941, were habilitated to deliver medicinal plants, even non \"liberated\", on condition that they are not registered on a list of venomous substances nor classified among the stupefacients, according to the article L. 4211-7\u00a0of Public Health Code. Concerning plants for herbal teas, which should be differentiated from herbal teas classified among the herbal medicines, they can be delivered in mixtures form, which are considered as officinal preparations, according to the new French Pharmacopoeia monography of August 1st 2013."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.
