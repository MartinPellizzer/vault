It was hypothesized that external magnetic field treatment (MFT) of seeds affecting internal magnet of cells may affect growth and metabolism. In this study, seeds were subjected to pre-sowing magnetic field (50\u00a0mT at 5\u00a0mm for 5\u00a0s). At vegetative stage, the leaf growth, chlorophyll content, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), amino acids, proteins, flavonoids, soluble sugars, total soluble phenolics, carotenoids, anthocyanins, phenolic profile (HPLC based), and antimicrobial activity of leaves (in terms of the minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were studied. Yield was evaluated for nutritive components in fruit (peel+pulp) and peel. MFT improved germination percentage, growth, leaf chlorophyll, antimicrobial activity, peel amino acids, phenolics, and POD with negligible effect on fruit nutritive value. Moreover, photosynthetic pigments and cinnamic acid exhibited direct correlation with antimicrobial potential against both pathogens. However, sinapic acid showed positive correlation against Staphylococcus aureus only. Cinnamic acid, coumaric acid, syringic acid, and quercetin were in direct correlation against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; it was directly correlated with total flavonoids too. In conclusion, magnetic field can be used to manipulate plant cell metabolism promising improvement of growth, antimicrobial activity, and phenolics of interest."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bukhari", "ForeName": "Shazia Anwer", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farah", "ForeName": "Nabila", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6510-6496"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan. drghulammustafa@gcuf.edu.pk."}], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Government College University, Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "Saqib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Government College University, Faisalabad, 38000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Naqvi", "ForeName": "Syed Ali Raza", "Initials": "SAR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Momordica charantia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30729394", "10.1007/s12010-019-02955-w", "10.1007/s12010-019-02955-w"]}}]}
