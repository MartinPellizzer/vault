Scrophularia striata is a plant endemic to Iran growing in the province of Ilam, wherein a gas refinery releases toxic agents such as H<sub>2</sub>S whose detrimental effects on the function and tolerability of medicinal plants in this region have yet to be elucidated. Thus, we initiated a hydroponic study into hormetic effect of sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) concentrations (0, 3 and 7\u00a0mM) as H<sub>2</sub>S-donor at different time points on oxidative status and phenolic compounds, focusing more on phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) in S. striata. Our results indicated that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) increased significantly at 3\u00a0mM NaHS after 48\u00a0h, while its peak at 7\u00a0mM occurred after 24\u00a0h. Nitric oxide (NO) level peaked at 3\u00a0mM and 7\u00a0mM after 24\u00a0h. Treatment with NaHS also resulted in a dose-dependent induction of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) enzyme activities, phenolic acids production (cinnamic acid, coumaric acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid and salicylic acid) and acteoside accumulation, ultimately leading to an increase in antioxidant capacity. Modulation of soluble sugars contents including glucose, mannose and rhamnose/xylose, occurred after the treatment with NaHS, likely increasing plant tolerance due to their biological activity and structural effects. Overall, our results suggest that dose-dependent accumulation of phenolics, notably acteoside, leads to an augmentation in antioxidant system to deal with H<sub>2</sub>S stress in S. striata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
