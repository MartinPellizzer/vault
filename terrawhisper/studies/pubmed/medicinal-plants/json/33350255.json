Among them, scientific fertilization is an important measure to realize the ecological planting of Chinese medicinal materials. In recent years, the social economy has developed rapidly. In the production of Chinese herbal medicines, a large amount of chemical fertilizers and pesticides have been gradually used to increase short-term economic benefits. The unreasonable use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has neglected the output, quality, safety, environmental pollution and environmental protection of medicinal materials. The impact of continuous development. Therefore, from the perspective of research on cultivation of Chinese medicinal materials, this article briefly describes the role and measures of scientific fertilization in ecological planting of Chinese medicinal materials. The roles of scientific fertilization in solving soil pollution and soil quality deterioration of Chinese herbal medicine cultivation, sustainable deve-lopment of Chinese herbal medicine production, unstable production quality of Chinese herbal medicine products, and quality safety are summarized separately. It is proposed measures based on the characteristics of soil fertilization, the growth and development characteristics of Chinese medicinal materials as the core, and the industrial planting model as the carrier to promote scientific fertilization in the cultivation of Chinese medicinal materials. Finally, the development direction of scientific fertilization and ecological plan-ting of traditional Chinese medicine is prospected, in order to provide support and reference for the development of ecological planting of traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Ya-Qin", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu-Lin", "ForeName": "Deng", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu-Shu", "ForeName": "Wen", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Jie-Yu", "ForeName": "Xiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Zhen-Huai", "ForeName": "Y U", "Initials": "YU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Si-Jia", "ForeName": "L I", "Initials": "LI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Santai County Mingzhi Maidong Professional Cooperative Mianyang 621102, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi-Wei", "ForeName": "Liu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology and Farming System in Southwest China, Ministry of Agriculture,College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Xing-Fu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asian People"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350255", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200707.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
