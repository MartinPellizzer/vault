The occurrence of retinal diseases is often accompanied by destruction of the blood\u2012retinal barrier, a vital physiological structure responsible for maintaining the stability of the retinal microenvironment. However, detailed summaries of the factors damage the blood\u2012retinal barrier and treatment methods involving natural plant medications are lacking.", "To comprehensively summarize and analyze the protective effects of active substances in natural plant medications on damage to the blood-retina barrier that occurs when retinal illnesses, particularly diabetic retinopathy, and examine their medicinal value and future development prospects.", "In this study, we searched for studies published in the ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The keywords used included natural plant medications, plants, natural herbs, blood retinal barrier, retinal diseases, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and uveitis. Chinese herbal compound articles, non-English articles, warning journals, and duplicates were excluded from the analysis.", "The blood\u2012retinal barrier is susceptible to high glucose, aging, immune responses, and other factors that destroy retinal homeostasis, resulting in pathological changes such as apoptosis and increased vascular permeability. Existing studies have shown that the active compounds or extracts of many natural plants have the effect of repairing blood-retinal barrier dysfunction. Notably, berberine, puerarin, and Lycium barbarum polysaccharides exhibited remarkable therapeutic effects. Additionally, curcumin, astragaloside IV, hesperidin, resveratrol, ginsenoside Rb1, luteolin, and Panax notoginseng saponins can effectively protect the blood\u2012retinal barrier by interfering with distinct pathways. The active ingredients found in natural plant medications primarily repair the blood\u2012retinal barrier by modulating pathological factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, pyroptosis, and autophagy, thereby alleviating retinal diseases.", "This review summarizes a series of plant extracts and plant active compounds that can treat retinal diseases by preventing and treating blood\u2012retinal barrier damage and provides reference for the research of new drugs for treating retinal diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
