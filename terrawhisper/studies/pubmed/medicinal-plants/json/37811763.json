The integration of traditional medicine, a vital cultural aspect, involves the use of medicinal plants to address various diseases, including obesity. This research merges network pharmacology (NP) and bioinformatics to innovate obesity treatment by identifying effective phytochemicals from native plants in the Taif valley. Focusing on six indigenous plants-<i>Senna alexandrina, Capsicum annuum, Zingiber officinale, Curcuma longa, Trigonella foenum-graecum,</i> and <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i>-we conducted preliminary screenings for potential bioactive compounds. We systematically compiled compound data from public databases and reviewed literature, revealing active compounds like apigenin, kaempferol, moupinamide, cyclocurcumin, chrysoeriol, isorhamnetin, rheinanthrone, cyclocurcumin, and riboflavin.Constructing a compound-target genes-obesity network unveiled their significant impact on metabolic regulation and fat accumulation, interacting notably with key proteins AKT1 and PTGS2. Molecular docking and 100\u2009ns Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations demonstrated robust binding affinity and stability at the docking site. Employing adipocytes as a cellular model, we gauged their viability and response to obesity-related stressors post-treatment with these native plant compounds.In conclusion, Saudi Arabia's indigenous plants hold promise as natural solutions for obesity treatment. This research opens new avenues in the battle against this pervasive health crisis by incorporating the potential of native botanicals.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
