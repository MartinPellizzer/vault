Herbal products have gained popularity in modern medicine due to their beneficial health properties and pharmacological activities. Flavonoids are an important class of secondary metabolites found to be present in medicinal plants and their derived products. Flavonoids have been known for their anti-allergic, anti-bacterial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, anti-proliferative, anti-mutagenic, antithrombotic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant and hepatoprotective activities in the medicine. Nicotiflorin is a flavonoidal class phytochemical, found in medicinal plants, including Traditional Chinese medicine.", "Scientific data on the medicinal importance and pharmacological activities of nicotiflorin have been collected and analyzed in the present work in order to know the therapeutic importance of nicotiflorin in medicine. Scientific data have been collected from Google, Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed and Scopus and analyzed in the present work. Analytical techniques data of separation, isolation and identification of nicotiflorin have also been collected and presented in the current work. Further biological importance of flavonoidal class phytochemicals was also discussed in the present work to understand the biological importance of nicotiflorin in medicine as it belongs to the flavonoid class.", "Scientific data analysis revealed the therapeutic importance and pharmacological activities of nicotiflorin. Nicotiflorin has significant biological potential against coronavirus, ischemia, renal impairment, hepatic complication, memory dysfunction and myocardial infarction. The biological potential of nicotiflorin against \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase enzymes, multiple myeloma cells and insulin secretion has also been discussed in the present work. Analytical data revealed the significance of modern analytical tools in medicine for the isolation, separation and quantification of nicotiflorin.", "Scientific data analysis of different research works revealed the biological importance and therapeutic potential of nicotiflorin in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Bioanal Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "9918418288306676", "ISSNLinking": "2949-6810"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35379162", "10.2174/1872312815666220404110200", "DML-EPUB-122231"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
