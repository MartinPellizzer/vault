We showed that dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics were involved in TAM resistance by protecting against mitochondrial apoptosis. The dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics were associated with increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased fission, thus preventing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytoplasm following TAM treatment. Dynamin-related GTPase protein mitofusin 1 (MFN1), which promotes fusion, was upregulated in TAM-resistant cells, and high MFN1 expression indicated a poor prognosis in TAM-treated patients. Mitochondrial translocation of MFN1 and interaction between MFN1 and mitofusin 2 (MFN2) were enhanced to promote mitochondrial outer membrane fusion. The interaction of MFN1 and cristae-shaping protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and OPA1 oligomerization were reduced due to augmented OPA1 proteolytic cleavage, and their apoptosis-promoting function was reduced due to cristae remodeling. Furthermore, the interaction of MFN1 and BAK were increased, which restrained BAK activation following TAM treatment. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of MFN1 blocked mitochondrial fusion, restored BAK oligomerization and cytochrome c release, and amplified activation of caspase-3/9, thus sensitizing resistant cells to apoptosis and facilitating the therapeutic effects of TAM both in vivo and in vitro. Conversely, overexpression of MFN1 alleviated TAM-induced mitochondrial apoptosis and promoted TAM resistance in sensitive cells. These results revealed that dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics contributes to the development of TAM resistance, suggesting that targeting MFN1-mediated mitochondrial fusion is a promising strategy to circumvent TAM resistance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
