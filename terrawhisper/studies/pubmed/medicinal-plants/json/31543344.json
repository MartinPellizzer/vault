TLR4-mediated acute inflammatory injury plays a pivotal role in ICH. Verbascoside (VB) is an active component of multiple medicinal plants, and exerts neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke by targeting the inflammatory response. However, the effects of VB on ICH and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of VB on acute ICH, and the possible involvement of TLR4-mediated inflammation. VB improved the behavioral score and reduced the hematoma volume, brain edema and neuronal apoptosis in a murine model of acute ICH. Mechanistically, VB attenuated macroglia activation and decreased inflammatory factor levels, which in turn protected the neurons. Furthermore, TLR4 knockout abolished the effects of VB both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. Taken together, VB attenuates the symptoms of ICH by targeting the TLR4-mediated acute inflammatory response."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
