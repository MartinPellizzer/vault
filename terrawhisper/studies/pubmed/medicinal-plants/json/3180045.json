This assay measures effects on the metabolism of [3H]benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] in hamster embryo cell cultures. Screening of several plant extracts has generated a number of activity leads. The 95% ethyl alcohol extract of one of these actives, Trifolium pratense L. Leguminosae, red clover, significantly inhibited the metabolism of B(a)P and decreased the level of binding of B(a)P to DNA by 30 to 40%. Using activity-directed fractionation by solvent partitioning and then silica gel chromatography, a major active compound was isolated and identified as the isoflavone, biochanin A. The pure compound decreased the metabolism of B(a)P by 54% in comparison to control cultures and decreased B(a)P-DNA binding by 37 to 50% at a dose of 25 micrograms/ml. These studies demonstrate that the hydrocarbon metabolism assay can detect and guide the fractionation of potential anticarcinogens from plants. The ability of the isoflavone biochanin A to inhibit carcinogen activation in cells in culture suggests that in vivo studies of this compound as a potential chemopreventive agent are warranted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy and Pharmacal Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907."}], "LastName": "Cassady", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zennie", "ForeName": "T M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chae", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ferin", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Portuondo", "ForeName": "N E", "Initials": "NE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baird", "ForeName": "W M", "Initials": "WM"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "CA 38151", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DH2M523P0H", "NameOfSubstance": "Genistein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U13J6U390T", "NameOfSubstance": "biochanin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genistein"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3180045"]}}]}
