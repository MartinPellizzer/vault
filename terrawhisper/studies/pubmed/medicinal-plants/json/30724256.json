Essential oil (EOs) content ranged from 0.33 to 1.75\u202fmL/100\u202fg d.w. in PS3 and J1 respectively. In this study sixty-five compounds were identified by GC-MS and characterized with the predominance of perillaldehyde, perilla ketone, \u00df-dehydro-elsholtzia ketone, limonene, shisofuran, farnesene (Z, E, \u03b1), \u00df-caryophyllene, trans-shisool. The biogenesis and composition of EOs are probably attributed to several factors. JTD3 had a significantly higher polyphenol content as well as showed the highest antioxidant capacity, whereas a strong positive linear correlation was observed between them. PS1 and NP 606 produced the maximum biomass correspondingly, while a large glandular trichome density was recorded for J1. The results support that perilla is rich in natural compounds that could be developed as nutraceuticals and/or phytomedicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd.
