In the present study, the Salmonella typhimurium tester strain YG1024 was used in the plate-incorporation test to examine the antimutagenic effect of phenolic compounds, extracted from common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), on 1-NP and B[a]P mutagenicity. Dose-response curves for 1-NP and B[a]P were obtained; the number of net revertants/plate at the peak mutagenic dosage were 880 for 1-NP and 490 for B[a]P. For the antimutagenicity studies doses of 0.1 microg/plate and 2 microg/plate for 1-NP and B[a]P, respectively, were chosen. We obtained a dose-response curve of ellagic acid (EA) against B[a]P and 1-NP mutagenicity. To test the bean extract, a dose of 300 microg/plate of EA was chosen as the antimutagenic control. The EA and bean extracts were not toxic to the bacteria at the concentrations tested. The inhibitory effects of the bean extracts and EA against B[a]P mutagenicity were dose-dependent. The percentages of inhibition produced against B[a]P (2 microg/plate) using 300 microg/plate of EA and for the extracts 500 microg equivalent catechin/plate were 82%, 83%, 81% and 83% for EA, water extract, water/methanol extract and methanol extract, respectively. However, for 1-NP mutagenicity, only the methanolic extract from beans showed an inhibitory effect. These results suggest that common beans, as other legumes, can function as health-promoting foods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Graduate Studies in Food Science, School of Chemistry, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro, Cerro de las Campanas S/N, Quer\u00e9taro, Qro., 76010, Mexico."}], "LastName": "de Mej\u00eda", "ForeName": "E G", "Initials": "EG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Casta\u00f1o-Tostado", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Loarca-Pi\u00f1a", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3417WMA06D", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TD1665I8Q4", "NameOfSubstance": "1-nitropyrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzo(a)pyrene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10224317", "10.1016/s1383-5718(99)00040-6", "S1383-5718(99)00040-6"]}}]}
