These diseases are associated with oxidative stresses caused by excess free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Antioxidant phytochemicals exert their effect by neutralizing these highly reactive radicals. Among the tens of thousands of phytochemicals found in our diets or traditional medicines, polyphenols and carotenoids stand out as the two most important groups of natural antioxidants. However, although collectively these phytochemicals are good antioxidants, the roles and effect of individual compounds are often not well known. Hundreds of carotenoids and thousands of polyphenols have been identified so far from various plants. A single plant could contain highly complex profiles of these compounds, which sometimes are labile to heat, air and light, and they may exist at very low concentrations in the plants. This makes the separation and detection of these antioxidant phytochemicals a challenging task. The present review focuses on the antioxidant activity, chemical types, sampling and sample processing procedures, and separation using various chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Detection and quantification using ultraviolet-visible-diode array and mass spectrometry will be discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Specialty Bioproducts and Bioprocesses, Food Research Program, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 93 Stone Road West, Guelph, Ont., Canada N1G 5C9. caor@agr.gc.ca"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsao", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Zeyuan", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Analyt Technol Biomed Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101139554", "ISSNLinking": "1570-0232"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15556490", "10.1016/j.jchromb.2004.09.028", "S1570-0232(04)00764-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
