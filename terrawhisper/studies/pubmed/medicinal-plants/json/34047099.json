The structures of the isolated compounds were identified by physicochemical properties and spectroscopic analysis, as well as comparisons with the data reported in literature. 17 compounds were isolated from the 90% ethanol extract of the stems and leaves of M. citrifolia, and were identified as 9,10-dihydroxy-4, 7-megastigmadien-3-one(1), 5,12-epoxy-6,9-hydroxy-7-megastigmen-3-one(2), fukinone(3), \u03b2-eudesmol(4), sarmentol F(5), 4, 5-dihydroblumenol A(6), 3-hydroxy-\u03b2-ionone(7), aristol-8-en-1-one(8), ergosta-7-en-3\u03b2-ol(9), ergosta-7-ene-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol(10),(22E)-5\u03b1,8\u03b1-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3\u03b2-ol(11), olivil(12), 4-epi-larreatricin(13), chushizisin \u2160(14), rabdosia acid A(15), glycerol monolinoleate(16) and(9Z,12Z,15Z)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl octadeca-trienoate(17). All compounds were isolated from M. citrifolia for the first time. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities via examining their inhibitory activities on the proliferation of synoviocytes in vitro using MTS met-hod. Compounds 1-11 showed significant anti-rheumatoid arthritis activities, displaying the inhibitory effects on the proliferation of MH7 A synovial fibroblast cell with the IC_(50) values ranging from(38.69\u00b10.86) to(203.45\u00b11.03) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China School of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou 350122, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ying-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Qiao-Mei", "Initials": "QM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Ze-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Hao-Xuan", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China School of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou 350122, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang-Ying", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China School of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fuzhou 350122, China Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province,Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Synoviocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34047099", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210224.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
