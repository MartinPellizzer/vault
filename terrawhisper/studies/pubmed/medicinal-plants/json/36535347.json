This study aimed to optimize the ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction of S. baicalensis root polysaccharide (SRP) and investigate its hypoglycemic and immunomodulatory activities. The optimal extraction conditions found in this study were as follows: cellulase concentration 165.6\u00a0U/mL, temperature 57.3\u00a0\u00b0C, liquid-solid ratio 44.8\u00a0mL/g, time 50\u00a0min, and ultrasonic power 225\u00a0W; with the yield reached up to 12.27\u00a0%. The ion exchange and gel filtration chromatographies were used to obtain a purified SRP. The carbohydrate content of SRP was 85.09\u00a0%, with a relatively high content of uronic acids (11.27\u00a0%). The SRP had a molecular weight of 89.7\u00a0kDa and was composed of eight monosaccharides. The inhibitory activity of SRP against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase was determined. It was revealed that SRP could effectively inhibit these two enzymes with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.23 and 0.63\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. Finally, the immunomodulatory effect of SRP on the dendritic cell activation was investigated, and the expressions of MHC II, CD80, CD86, and CD40 increased by 1.56, 1.96, 1.75, and 1.70 times, respectively, by the SRP treatment. This work will provide a foundation for SRP's efficient extraction and utilization for diabetes and immune therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
