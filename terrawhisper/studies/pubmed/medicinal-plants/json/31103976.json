The study was aimed to explore the potential of T.T methanol extract (T.T ME) for anti-Alzheirmer activity along with its safety evaluation. Plant was characterized by physicochemical, phytochemical and GCMS analyses whereas acute oral toxicity (OECD 425) was performed for safety evaluation. AlCl<sub>3</sub> induced Alzheimer's disease rat model was used for anti-Alzheirmer activity. T.T ME was given orally at 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg doses for 21 days and behavioral parameters were observed on 22nd study day. Physicochemical parameters were in permissible limits. GCMS analysis showed eight different compounds and benzene dicarboxylic acid showed maximum % peak area (64.19). No mortality was noted in acute toxicity study. Behavioral studies showed highly significant (p<0.001) improvement in T.T ME treated groups. Antioxidant enzymes and acetylcholinesterase levels were significantly (p<0.05) improved on treatment with T.T ME. Histopathological analysis indicated that neurofibrillary tangles were significantly improved in T.T ME treated groups. Biochemical and behavioral results suggested that T.T contained lead compounds which are effective in the treatment of Alzheimer disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Chauhdary", "ForeName": "Zunera", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Uzma", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Riphah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Riphah International University, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Bashir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy Practice, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Shahid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Muhammad Ajmal", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3CYT62D3GA", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tribulus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31103976"]}}]}
