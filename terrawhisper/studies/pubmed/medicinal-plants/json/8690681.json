Residues in polyester bags incubated for 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h were analyzed for mean particle size. Initially, gamagrass had a 10.2% greater (P < .05) proportion of DM as particles larger than 300 microns that did orchardgrass or red clover, whereas forages ground through a 5-mm mesh (5-mm forage) had a 7.5% greater (P < .05) proportion of DM as 300 microns or larger particles than forages ground through a 2-mm mesh (2-mm forage). Mean particle size decreased with incubation time, resulting in reductions of 44, 42, 53, and 49% of gamagrass, orchardgrass, and 2- and 5-mm forages, respectively, after 60 h. Mean particle size of red clover was reduced 67% after 36 h of incubation. Particle size reduction was initiated earlier (12 vs 36 h) and occurred at a 150% faster (P < .01) rate for red clover than for gamagrass or orchardgrass. Although there was no difference (P > .10) between grinding mesh size at the time at which particle size reduction was initiated (24 h), particle reduction occurred at a 136% faster (P < .05) rate for forages ground through a 5-mm screen than for forages ground through a 2-mm screen. A greater (P < .10) reduction (595 microns by 36 h) in mean particle size occurred in red clover than in gamagrass or orchardgrass (average 376 microns by 60 h) during ruminal incubation. In addition, 5-mm forages exhibited a greater (P < .10) reduction in mean particle size (527 microns) than did 2-mm forages (372 microns) after 60 h of incubation. Substantial particle size reduction occurred in situ due to microbial digestion. The faster particle size reduction found in red clover may contribute to the greater observed intake for legumes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal and Range Sciences, Montana State University, Bozeman 59717, USA."}], "LastName": "Bowman", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Firkins", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8690681", "10.2527/1996.742439x"]}}]}
