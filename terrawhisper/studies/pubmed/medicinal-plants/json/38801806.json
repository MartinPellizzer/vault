The extremely low content of ginsenoside F1 in herbs has limited its research and application in medical field. In this work, we constructed a pathway in tobacco for the biosynthesis of ginsenoside F1 by metabolic engineering. Four enzyme genes (PnDDS, CYP716A47, CYP716S1 and UGT71A56) isolated from Panax notoginseng were introduced into tobacco. Thus, a biosynthetic pathway for ginsenoside F1 synthesis was artificially constructed in tobacco cells; moreover, the four exogenous genes could be expressed in the roots, stems and leaves of transgenic plants. Consequently, ginsenoside F1 and its precursors were successfully synthesized in the transgenic tobacco, compared with Panax plants, the content of ginsenoside F1 in transgenic tobacco was doubled. In addition, accumulation of ginsenoside F1 and its precursors in transgenic tobacco shows organ specificity. Based on these results, a new approach was established to produce rare ginsenoside F1; meanwhile, such strategy could also be employed in plant hosts for the heterologous synthesis of other important or rare natural products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
