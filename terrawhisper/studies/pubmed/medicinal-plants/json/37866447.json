Rhododendron plants have not only good ornamental and economic value but also significant medicinal potential. In China, many Rhododendron plants are used as traditional Chinese medicine or ethnic medicine for the treatment of respiratory diseases, pain, bleeding and inflammation. Rhododendron is known for its abundant metabolites, especially diterpenoids. In the past 13 years, a total of 610 chemical constituents were reported from Rhododendron plants, including 222 diterpenoids, 122 triterpenoids, 103 meroterpenoids, 71 flavonoids and 92 other constituents (lignans, phenylpropanoids, phenolic acids, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, coumarins, steroids, fatty acids). Moreover, the bioactivities of various extracts and isolates, both in vitro and in vivo, were also investigated. Our review summarized the research progress of Rhododendron regarding traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology in the past 13 years (2010 to December 2022), which will provide new insight for prompting further research on Rhododendron application and drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
