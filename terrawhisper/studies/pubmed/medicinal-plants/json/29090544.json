The content of quercetin,kaempferol and isorhamnetin was determined by HPLC. The correlation between flavonoids components and ecological factors was analyzed using partial least-squares regression (PLSR). Based on Maxent model combining using ArcGIS software, suitable regionalization for H.rhamnoides subsp. sinensis was studied.The results showed that the difference of quercetin,kaempferol and isorhamnetin content in samples from different regions were obvious. The main factors effecting quercetin content accumulation were the altitude andthe average monthly precipitation in January and August. The main factors effecting kaempferol accumulation were the altitude andthe average monthly precipitation in the coldest quarter and December. The main factors effecting isorhamnetin accumulation were the average monthly precipitation in August, January and the coldest quarter.The regional distribution suitability index for H.rhamnoides subsp. sinensis was 0-0.708. The suitable area 590 500 km\u00b2, accounting for 6.13% of the total area. The preferably suitable area was 552 500 km\u00b2, accounting for 5.73% of the total area.The methods used in the study is simple and feasible, the result is reliable which provide a new approach for Tibetan medicine resources sustainable exploitation and utilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Jin-Song", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Cai-Yun", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chuan", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Cai-Xiang", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Ethnic Medicine, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "07X3IB4R4Z", "NameOfSubstance": "3-methylquercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "731P2LE49E", "NameOfSubstance": "kaempferol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Altitude"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hippophae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29090544", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0078"]}}]}
