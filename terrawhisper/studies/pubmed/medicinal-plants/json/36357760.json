However, no maximum residue limit (MRL) of mandipropamid has been identified for ginseng, and there have been few related studies. We established and verified the analysis method of mandipropamid in ginseng using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method has good linearity and accuracy in the range of 0.002-0.5\u00a0mg/kg. The average recovery of mandipropamid was 87.4-101.6%, and the standard deviation was 1.1-4.0. Mandipropamid in ginseng plants and soil rapidly degraded following first-order kinetics models. The degradation dynamics showed that the half-life of mandipropamid in ginseng plant and soil was 13.8-28.0 and 9.8-27.4 d, respectively. After the recommended dose of mandipropamid was applied once, the residual content of mandipropamid in fresh ginseng, dried ginseng, red ginseng, ginseng plant, and ginseng soil was\u2009<\u20090.01-0.185,\u2009<\u20090.01-0.265, 0.085-1.544, 0.075-4.800, and\u2009<\u20090.01-0.014\u00a0mg/kg, respectively. The dietary risk assessment of mandipropamid on ginseng showed that the risk quotient value was far less than 100%, indicating that the recommended dose of mandipropamid does not cause unacceptable risks to humans. After the recommended dose of mandipropamid was applied once, it did not cause unacceptable risks to humans. This study not only provides a reasonable spray dosage of mandipropamid to ginseng but also offers a reference for the establishment of MRLs in China."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
