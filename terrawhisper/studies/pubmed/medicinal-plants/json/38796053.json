Although it has been widely used in the growth of medicinal plants, human beings may take it by taking traditional Chinese medicine. There are no published studies on PBZ exposure in humans or standardized limits for PBZ in medicinal plants. We measured the solubility, oil-water partition coefficient (logP), and pharmacokinetics of PBZ in rats and established a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of PBZ in rats. This was followed by extrapolation to healthy Chinese adult males as a theoretical foundation for future risk assessment of PBZ. The results showed that PBZ had low solubility and high fat solubility. Pharmacokinetic experiments showed that PBZ was absorbed rapidly but eliminated slowly in rats. On this basis, the rat PBPK model was successfully constructed and extrapolated to healthy Chinese adult males to predict the plasma concentration-time curve and exposure of PBZ in humans. The construction of the PBPK model of PBZ in this study facilitates the determination of the standard formulation limits and risk assessment of PBZ residues in medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
