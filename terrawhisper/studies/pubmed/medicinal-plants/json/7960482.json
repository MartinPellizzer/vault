They were divided into four equal groups as control, alloxan-diabetic, diabetic + GbE and control + GbE. After the onset of experimental period, diabetic + GbE and control + GbE groups received ginkgo biloba extract and the other groups were given saline solution for ten weeks. Diabetic and diabetic + GbE groups were made diabetic by injecting alloxan on 16th day. Spectral analysis of EEGs recorded from parietal lobes of all groups of rats were computed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. Their amplitude maxima were found to occupy the frequency bands of 1-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-16 and 16-30 Hz. Significant amplitude increase was found in 1-2 and 2-4 Hz frequency bands in diabetic + GbE group compared with control, but no differences were found for other groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "A\u011far", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yargi\u00e7o\u011flu", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Apaydin", "ForeName": "K C", "Initials": "KC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "O\u011fuz", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Neurosci", "NlmUniqueID": "0270707", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electroencephalography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7960482", "10.3109/00207459408986008"]}}]}
