TIA pathways species utilize several CYP72A subfamily members to form loganic acid from 7-deoxyloganic acid (a simple hydroxylation) as well as secologanin and secologanic acid from loganin and loganic acid (a C-C bond scission). Divergences in the specificities of these P450s have allowed <i>Camptotheca</i> secologanic acid synthases (SLASs) to become bifunctional enzymes capable of performing both reactions. In contrast, <i>Catharanthus</i> 7-deoxyloganic acid hydroxylase (7DLH) and secologanin synthase (SLS) have remained monofunctional enzymes capable either of monooxygenation or C-C bond scission. Our in vitro reconstitutions have now demonstrated that <i>Camptotheca</i> also contains a monofunctional 7DLH capable only of hydroxylating 7-deoxyloganic acid. Mutageneses aimed at evaluating residues important for the tight specificity of <i>Camptotheca</i> 7DLH (CYP72A729) and the broad specificity of SLAS (CYP72A564) have identified several residues where reciprocal switches substantially affect their activities: Lys128His in 7DLH increases hydroxylation of 7-deoxyloganic acid, and His132Lys in SLAS decreases this hydroxylation and C-C bond scissions of loganic acid and loganin; Gly321Ser in 7DLH does not affect hydroxylation of 7-deoxyloganic acid, whereas Ser324Gly in SLAS significantly increases C-C bond scission of loganic acid; Asp332Glu in the acid-alcohol pair of 7DLH increases hydroxylation of 7-deoxyloganic acid, whereas Glu335Asp in SLAS completely eliminates both of its activities. These mutations that enhance or eliminate these respective activities have significant potential to aid engineering efforts aimed at increasing TIA production in cell cultures, microbial systems, and/or other plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}], "LastName": "Yaroslavsky", "ForeName": "Mark A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3529-6097"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "Justin C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0009-9891-2254"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biology, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States."}], "LastName": "Schuler", "ForeName": "Mary A", "Initials": "MA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "T32 GM136629", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "7-deoxyloganic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "secologanic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H7WJ16Q93C", "NameOfSubstance": "loganin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "22255-40-9", "NameOfSubstance": "loganic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camptotheca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalytic Domain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37656055", "10.1021/acs.biochem.3c00126"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
