All three compounds strongly affected the spectrum of the enzyme, leading to the formation of a stable band at 336 nm both in anaerobiosis and in aerobiosis, consistent with an interaction with the enzyme cofactor 6-hydroxydopa. On the contrary, the corresponding propylamine compounds 1,3-diaminopropane, 3-Br-propylamine, and 3-C1-propylamine were reversible inhibitors of lentil amine oxidase. Inhibition was shown to be due to the aldehyde oxidation products rather than the short chain amines themselves; a reaction mechanism is presented which involves attack of the aldehyde on the 6-hydroxydopa-derived free radical catalytic intermediate. With 1,2-diaminoethane, 2-Br-ethylamine, and 2-C1-ethylamine, the complex produced will form a stable 6-membered ring, causing irreversible inhibition of the enzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Chemistry, University of Cagliari, Italy."}], "LastName": "Medda", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Padiglia", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "J Z", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agr\u00f2", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rotilio", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Floris", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0370623", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2960"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenediamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propylamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "18370-81-5", "NameOfSubstance": "3-bromopropylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60V9STC53F", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylenediamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.3.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P7YLY3O329", "NameOfSubstance": "2-chloroethylamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenediamines"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Propylamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9054566", "10.1021/bi961410w", "bi961410w"]}}]}
