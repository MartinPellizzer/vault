The experiment was conducted over 28 d on 48 male pigs of about 12\u00a0kg body weight (BW), which were allocated to following treatments.: (1) Control Group (Con) without additive, (2) Group I, addition of a prebiotic (inulin), (3) Group Ph, a phytobiotic (herbal water extracts), (4) Group P, a probiotic composed of four strains of lactic acid bacteria, (5) Group PhP, phytobiotic and probiotic bacteria and (6) Group PhPI, a phytobiotic, probiotic bacteria and a prebiotic. Animal performance was recorded and at d 28 six pigs from each group were euthanised to collect digesta samples. In all groups except for Group I, diarrhoea incidents were observed. Groups Ph and P had significantly higher daily gains and final BW, and Group Ph utilised feed better than other groups. The pH of ileal digesta was significantly lower in Group PhPI. In the caecal digesta of Groups I, P and PhP, the pH level was lower than in the other groups but dry matter contents was significantly higher in Groups Con and I. The short-chain fatty acids and particular acid content differed significantly only in the colonic digesta. The yeast and mould numbers in caecal digesta was highest in Group Con. No treatment effects were observed for the number of lactic acid bacteria, coli group bacteria or Clostridium. However, the observed significantly higher number of total bacteria suggests that a multi-component eubiotic treatment changes the bacterial composition and distribution more effectively. Our findings indicated that all used additives changed the intestinal microflora, but the multi-component eubiotics were not beneficial as feed additives offered separately. Moreover, supplementation of phytobiotics and probiotic bacteria also improved the animal performance significantly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
