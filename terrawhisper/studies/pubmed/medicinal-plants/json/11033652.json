The contemporary world view which sees a radical distinction between humans as subjects and world as object can obscure our recognition of how much we rely on nature for health and survival. Indigenous traditions and contemporary scholars remind us that we live in a universe in which all things are connected, and in which nature continues to offer its gifts in co-creative partnership for the health and wellbeing of all. Living in awareness of our relationship with nature enables us to open more to the experience of nature's nurturing. Many complementary therapies derive from ancient practices that involve nature in healing partnership. As nurses and midwives we must learn to expand our boundaries to encompass the many ways that nature partners with us for healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "West Virginia University School of Nursing, USA. pburkhar@marshall.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Burkhardt", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Scotland", "MedlineTA": "Complement Ther Nurs Midwifery", "NlmUniqueID": "9506953", "ISSNLinking": "1353-6117"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aromatherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Holistic Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, North American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Philosophy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "25"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11033652", "10.1054/ctnm.1999.0438", "S1353-6117(99)90438-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
