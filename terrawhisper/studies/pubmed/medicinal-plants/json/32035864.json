Originally from tropical America, the Jatropha genus can be found all over the tropics and subtropics of Asia and Africa. Jatropha species are recognized to be important sources of secondary metabolites with a broad spectrum of biological functions. Extracts and isolated compounds from species of this genus have been known to have properties of cytotoxicity, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, insecticidal, larvicidal, inhibition AChE, and toxicity activities. Investigations on the chemical aspects of the genus Jatropha have led to the identification of cyclic peptides, lignans, flavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids, eudesmenoic acids, and mainly terpenes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive picture of the phytochemical and biological characteristics of Jatropha species. The information gathered and approached in this paper might support the planning and discussion of future studies on the topic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
