Correct herbal authentication is of paramount importance to the safety and best interest of consumers. On the market, there is no comprehensive blockchain-based system to track the processes from plantation to manufacturing and to the sale. With the advancement of information technology, an open and transparent blockchain-based platform, <i>HerBChain</i>, was created to enhance the quality control of herbal products. The implementation of blockchain technology is to minimize the manipulation of recorded information. <i>HerBChain</i> is an information platform for recording the six important processes of herbal product manufacturing and marketing, which include plantation base, TCM processing factory, TCM manufacturer, testing laboratory, distributor and retailer. By duly recording the parameters and data essential for product quality in manufacturing and supply chain, the traceability and reliability of the products can be ensured."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University.
