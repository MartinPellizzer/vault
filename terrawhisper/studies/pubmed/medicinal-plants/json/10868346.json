Hydrocortisone (HC) is known to inhibit superoxide generation and was used as the reference scavenger. WSP was examined for its effect on antioxidation in young (PDL 20, 25% of the maximum life span) and old (PDL 50, 62.5% of the maximum life span) human fibroblasts (TIG-1). Cells were treated with WSP or HC for 4 and 6 wk in young cells, and for 3 and 6 wk in old cells. The cytosolic superoxide dismutase activity in the cells treated with WSP or HC tended to decrease as compared with that in the non-treated cells (control) with the exception of WSP-treated young cells 4 wk after culturing. Young cells were equal in glutathione peroxidase activity to the control, but the activity level in WSP- or HC-treated young cells 6 wk after culturing was 10-50% lower than that in the control. Young and old cells treated with WSP or HC were superior to the control in catalase activity with the exception of HC-treated old cells. WSP- or HC-treated cells were higher in glutathione (GSH) concentration than the control with the exception of WSP-treated young cells 4 wk after culturing and HC-treated old cells 6 wk after culturing. Such increases in catalase activity and GSH concentration by WSP treatment may be related to the delay of cellular aging-dependent degeneration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory on Ageing, Chukyo Junior College, Gifu, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Okada", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0402640", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cellular Senescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diploidy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10868346", "10.3177/jnsv.46.1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
