Pretreatment of the hearts with high dose of Chuanxiong-pathalide A (0.05 mg x mL(-1)) prior to the ischemia and reperfusion, reduced the incidence of reperfusion-induced VF and VT to 37.5% as compared with non-pretreated control group (P < 0.05). The duration of occurrence of VF and VT in the group pretreated with Chuanxiong-pathalide A at dosages of 0.012 5 mg x mL(-1), 0.025 mg x mL(-1) and 0.05 mg x mL(-1) were (7.50 +/- 1.61), (1.64 +/- 0.67) and (1.06 +/- 0.70) min respectively, which were significantly shorter than (23.51 +/- 3.99) min in non-pretreated control group; 0.05 mg x mL(-1) of Chuanxiong-pathalide A increased coronary flow in comparison with the control group. The content of SOD in the group pretreated with 0.05 mg x mL(-1) of Chuanxiong-pathalide A was (59.6 +/- 18.7) U x mg(-1), significant lower than (92.3 +/- 19.0) U x mg(-1) in the non-pretreated group. The contents of LDH and MDA were (2 378.0 +/- 196.3) U x g(-1) and (12.1 +/- 1.3) nmol x mg(-1) in the non-pretreated group, which were much higher than the values of (1 669.4 +/- 192.5) U x g(-1) and (6.9 +/- 0.8) nmol x mg(-1) in the group pretreated with Chuanxiong-pathalide A respectively.
