Tribulus terrestris L., an annual medicinal herb of Zygophyllaceae family, has gained significant attention due to its diverse medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer effects. Diosgenin, a steroidal saponin, is the major bioactive compound responsible for the medicinal importance of T. terrestris. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the genes involved in the diosgenin biosynthetic pathway in T. terrestris. To address this gap, this study aimed to identify candidate genes associated with diosgenin biosynthesis through whole transcriptome profiling. A total of \u223c7.9\u00a0GB of data, comprising 482 million reads, was obtained and assembled into 148,871 unigenes. Subsequently, functional annotations were assigned to 50\u00a0% of the unigenes using sequence similarity searches against the NCBI non-redundant (NR), Uniprot, KEGG, Pfam, GO, and COG databases, primarily based on Gene Ontology and KEGG-KAAS pathways. The majority of unigenes associated with the biosynthesis of the steroidal diosgenin backbone exhibited up-regulation in the fruit, leaf, and root tissues, except the SQE gene in root. The differential expression of selected genes was further validated through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Additionally, the study identified 21,026 unigenes related to transcription factors and 15,551 unigenes containing simple sequence repeats (SSR). Notably, di-nucleotide SSR motifs exhibited a high repeat frequency. These findings greatly enhance our understanding of the diosgenin biosynthesis pathway and provide a basis for future research in molecular investigation and metabolic engineering, specifically for boosting diosgenin content."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
