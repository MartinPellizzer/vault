These molecules play a crucial role as organic tracers by providing a chemical perspective on viewing the material world, as well as offering a wealth of information on metabolic activities. Among the diverse lipid compounds, hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) with one to multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon chain stand out as important biomarkers for different sources of organic matter. HFAs are widespread in nature and are involved in biotransformation and oxidation processes in living organisms. The unique chemical and physical properties attributed to the hydroxyl group make HFAs ideal biomarkers in biomedicine and environmental toxicology, as well as organic geochemistry. The molecular distribution patterns of HFAs can be unique and diagnostic for a given class of organisms, including animals, plants, and microorganisms. Thus, HFAs can act as a valuable proxy for understanding the ecological relationships between different organisms and their environment. Furthermore, HFAs have numerous industrial applications due to their higher reactivity, viscosity, and solvent miscibility. This review paper integrates the latest research on the sources and chemical analyses of HFAs, as well as their applications in industrial/medicinal production and as biomarkers in environmental studies. This review article also provides insights into the biogeochemical cycles of HFAs in the surface Earth system, highlighting the importance of these compounds in understanding the complex interactions between living organisms and the environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
