Benth.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "115964", "MedlinePgn": "115964"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Medicinal plants belonging to the genus Mimosa, such as Mimosa tenuiflora, M. caesalpinifolia, and M. verrucosa are known for their popular use for asthma, bronchitis and fever. Ethnopharmacological studies report that Mimosa acutistipula is used to treat alopecia and pharyngitis, conditions that can be related to oxidative stress, inflammatory processes and painful limitations. However, there is no studies on its efficacy and mechanism of action.", "To elucidate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity of M. acutistipula leaves.", "Phytochemical profile of M. acutistipula extracts was evaluated by several reaction-specific methods. Secondary metabolites such as tannins, phenols and flavonoids were quantified with colorimetric assays. In vitro antioxidant potential was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS\u00a0+\u00a0as free radical scavenging tests, FRAP and phosphomolybdenum as oxide-reduction assays, and anti-hemolytic for lipid peroxidation evaluation. In vivo anti-inflammatory evaluation was performed by paw edema, and peritonitis induced by carrageenan. Analgesic effect and its possible mechanisms were determined by acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and the formalin test. Antipyretic activity was evaluated by yeast-induced fever.", "Cyclohexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of leaves had presence of tannins, flavonoids, phenol, alkaloids, terpenes (except methanolic extract), and saponins (only for methanolic and chloroformic extracts). In phenols, flavonoids and tannins quantification, methanolic and ethyl acetate extract had higher amounts of this phytocompounds. Ethyl acetate extract, due to its more expressive quantity of phenols and flavonoids, was chosen for carrying out the in vivo tests. Due to the relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation, antioxidant tests were performed, showing that ethyl acetate extract had a high total antioxidant activity (70.18%), moderate activity in DPPH radical scavenging, and a moderate ABTS\u00a0+\u00a0radical inhibition (33.61%), and FRAP assay (112.32\u00a0\u03bcg Fe<sup>2+</sup>/g). M. acutistipula showed anti-inflammatory activity, with 54.43% of reduction in paw edema (50\u00a0mg/kg) when compared to the vehicle. In peritonitis test, a reduction in the concentration of NO could be seen, which is highly involved in the anti-inflammatory activity and is responsible for the increase in permeability. In the analgesic evaluation, most significant results in writhing test were seen at 100\u00a0mg/kg, with a 34.7% reduction of writhing. A dual mechanism of action was confirmed with the formalin test, both neurogenic and inflammatory pain were reduced, with a mechanism via opioid route. In the antipyretic test, results were significantly decreased at all concentrations tested.", "M. acutistipula leaves ethyl acetate extract showed expressive concentrations of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. It also exhibited anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, besides its antipyretic effect. Thus, these results provide information regarding its popular use and might help future therapeutics involving this specimen."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
