Incorporation of these medicines within the formal health care system, which is the stated intention of the Health Ministry, requires the establishment of standards for quality control. Except in the case of a handful of South African plant species, such standards are lacking. Of central importance with respect to quality control is correct identification of the species concerned, whether in the fresh, dried or powdered state. In cases where botanical identification is impossible, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detection (DAD), offers an alternative qualitative profile and is being increasingly used for the authentication of crude drugs or their extracts. As a contribution to establishing quality standards for South African plant species used as traditional medicines, HPLC-DAD \"fingerprints\" of 60 commonly-used species have been generated in our laboratory. One of these species is presented here, together with UV spectra of individual components represented by major peaks in the HPLC profiles."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "South African Traditional Medicines Research Group, School of Pharmacy, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa. evan.springfield@mrc.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Springfield", "ForeName": "E P", "Initials": "EP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eagles", "ForeName": "P K F", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Scott", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gentianaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15919166", "10.1016/j.jep.2005.03.012", "S0378-8741(05)00244-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
