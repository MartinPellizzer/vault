Garlic is a traditional plant used as a spice and herb in broilers.", "To investigate the effect of garlic powder on broiler performance, carcass characteristics, blood hematology, and biochemistry.", "A total of 240 1-day-old broiler chicks (Cobb500) were purchased from a local hatchery and randomly distributed into four dietary treatments. Each treatment comprised 5 replicates with 12 chicks each. Garlic powder (<i>Allium sativum</i>) was supplemented as follows: 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3%. The diets were formulated to be approximately isocaloric and cover all nutrient requirements for broilers throughout two stages of growth periods: starter diets (1-21 days) and finisher diets (22-42 days). At the end of the experiment, one bird was chosen from each replicate to measure the carcass characteristics and blood was collected.", "The findings showed that birds fed a diet supplemented by 0.3% garlic powder was significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) better in terms of body weight, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio compared to those birds fed 0%, 0.1%, or 0.2% garlic powder. In addition, feeding 0.1% or 0.2% garlic powder significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) packed cell volume, total white blood cells, neutrophil, eosinophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte compared to the control group. Furthermore, garlic supplementation led to a decrease in alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein compared to the control. At the same time, high density lipoprotein was significantly increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) by garlic supplementation.", "It can be concluded that the supplementation of 0.3% garlic powder as a growth promoter leads to reducing the cost of production through improving growth performance and enhancing birds' health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Sebha, Sebha, Libya."}], "LastName": "Kairalla", "ForeName": "Majdi A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Benghazi, Benghazi, Libya."}], "LastName": "Alshelmani", "ForeName": "Mohamed I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Alzintan, Libya."}], "LastName": "Aburas", "ForeName": "Abdalhakim A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial, Veterinary"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Libya", "MedlineTA": "Open Vet J", "NlmUniqueID": "101653182", "ISSNLinking": "2218-6050"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Aarti C, Khusro A.
