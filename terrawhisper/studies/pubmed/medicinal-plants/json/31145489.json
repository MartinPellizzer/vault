Fresh ovarian fragments from 16 adult sheep were fixed for histological analysis (Control 1) or in vitro cultured individually in \u03b1-MEM<sup>+</sup> supplemented with 0.3\u00a0mg/ml J.\u00a0insularis (Step 1) for 7\u00a0days. Part of the fragments then were fixed for histological analysis (in vitro culture group). Remaining fragments were exposed stepwise to increasing trehalose concentrations before immediate isolation of SF and viability assessment (Control 2) or after 6\u00a0days of culture in \u03b1-MEM<sup>++</sup> supplemented with 0.3\u00a0mg/ml J.\u00a0insularis (Step 2). In Step 1, percentage of follicular activation was 80%. In Step 2, a significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in follicular diameter and antrum formation within 6\u00a0days in vitro culture of isolated follicles was achieved. The total antioxidant capacity from both steps significantly increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) from day 2 to day 6. Confocal analysis of oocytes showed 57.14% oocytes with homogeneous distribution and 42.86% with peri-cortical distribution. In conclusion, SF can be successfully isolated from sheep ovarian cortex after 7\u00a0days of culture and are capable of surviving and forming an antral cavity if cultured in vitro for an additional 6\u00a0days in the presence of 0.3\u00a0mg/ml J.\u00a0insularis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4455-362X"],
