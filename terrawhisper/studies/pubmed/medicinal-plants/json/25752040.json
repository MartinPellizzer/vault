The infrared spectra of 206 stems from 30 Dendrobium varieties were obtained, and showed that polysaccharides, especially fiber, were the main components in Dendrobium plants. FTIR combined with Wilks' Lambda stepwise discriminative analysis was used to identify Dendrobium varieties. The effects of spectral range and number of training samples on the discrimination results were also analysed. Two hundred eighty seven variables in the spectral range of 1 800-1 250 cm(-1) were studied, and showed that the return discrimination is 100% correct when the training samples number of each species was 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively, whereas for the remaining samples the correct rates of identification were equal to 79.4%, 91.3%, 93.0%, 98.2%, and 100%, respectively. The same discriminative analyses on five different training samples in the spectral range of 1 800-1 500, 1 500-1 250, 1 250-600, 1 250-950 and 950-650 cm(-1) were compared, which showed that the variables in the range of 1 800-1 250, 1 800-1 500 and 950-600 cm(-1) were more suitable for variety identification, and one can obtain the satisfactory result for discriminative analysis when the training sample is more than 3. Our results indicate that FTIR combined with stepwise discriminative analysis is an effective way to distinguish different Dendrobium varieties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Zhong", "Initials": "YZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25752040"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
