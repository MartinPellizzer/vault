They have contrasting and highly stable biological characteristics which are genetically controlled. BCMV strain US-5 belongs to pathogenicity group IV. BCMNV strain NL-8 belongs to pathogenicity group III. The two strains have contrasting serological characteristics: NL-8 is serotype A; US-5 is serotype B. When these two strains were maintained separately or as a mixture for more than three years (39 serial transfers) or in more than 100 plants of either of two susceptible hosts, we were unable to isolate a single virus strain that exhibited mutant-like or recombinant-like characteristics. However, within 28 days (during the 1st passage) after these 2 strains were inoculated to opposite primary leaves of bean plants that were susceptible to one virus and resistant to the other, we were able to recover 17 strains that clearly possessed recombinations of various phenotypic characteristics from each of the two \"parental\" viruses. Three types of phenotypic characteristics were recombined singly or in combination during a single passage in vivo: 1) Biological characteristics known to be controlled by genes for pathogenicity; 2) Serotype; and 3) Temperature-induced hypersensitive vascular necrosis. Each of the phenotypic recombinant strains contained only pathogenicity genes or serological characteristics found in one or both parents. In no case did we isolate a strain that could be described as a random mutation or one that contained pathogenicity or serological characteristics which were not found in at least one parent strain. This is the first known demonstration of phenotypic recombinations between distinct potyviruses in vivo. Implications for the evolution of new virus strains through the use of resistant cultivars and its impact on breeding programs and bean seed production are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Center, Prosser, Washington, USA. silber@bentonrea.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Silbernagel", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mink", "ForeName": "G I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "G Y", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Austria", "MedlineTA": "Arch Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "7506870", "ISSNLinking": "0304-8608"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Innate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Potyvirus"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Reassortant Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recombination, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11448021", "10.1007/s007050170132"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
