The protein, mineral and trace element contents of raw products were similar to those published in a previous study. In general, partial (ground) or total removal of the seed coat of pulses (ground and washed) was without effect on composition. Soaking the pulses followed by cooking under pressure was without effect on the protein, mineral and trace element composition, although it resulted in variable losses of phytic acid. In all instances greater nutrient and phytate losses were observed when the seed coat was completely removed. With nutrient and phytate losses were observed when the seed coat was completely removed. With the exception of lentils, the phytate: Zn molar ratios of cooked pulses and chapatis was greater than 15 and the [Phytate] X [Ca]/[Zn] (mol/kg) ratios of the chapatis and four of the 13 cooked dishes were greater than 0.5. Both of these ratios may provide useful indices of the bioavailability of dietary Zn. The results are discussed in relation to the possible inadequacy of available dietary Zn in some sections of the UK, Asian community."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "N T", "Initials": "NT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Warrington", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Nutr Appl Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8207515", "ISSNLinking": "0263-8495"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3957703"]}}]}
