Since medicinal herbs containing biocompatible substances that are accepted by patient more than chemical therapeutics, they can be considered a safe option for treating BC.", "This study evaluated the effect of Sambucus Ebulus (S. ebulus) extract on a model of TNBC.", "S. ebulus extract was prepared using petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The petroleum ether extract was fractionated and analyzed using vacuum liquid chromatography and GC-MS, respectively. MDAMB- 231 and MCF-10A were used as TNBC and normal breast cells, respectively. Flowcytometry and MTT assays were performed to evaluate cell cycle, apoptosis, and viability of the cells. Gene expression analysis was performed using RT-qPCR. Nude mouse allograft tumor models were used, and pathological sections were evaluated.", "The findings indicated that S. ebulus extract remarkably decreased cell proliferation and viability. The extract had no toxicity to the normal breast cells but efficiently killed the cancer cells. Cell cycle- and apoptosisrelated gene expression showed that fraction 4 of S. ebulus extract significantly increased the expression of Bax, Bak, P53, and c-MYC.", "This study showed satisfactory results of the effect of S. ebulus extract on clearing BC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, S. ebulus extract may be a safe herbal compound for eliminating BC cells without toxicity to host cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Omrani", "ForeName": "Vahid F", "Initials": "VF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Koochaki", "ForeName": "Ameneh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Evidencebased Phytotherapy and Complementary Medicine Research Center, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Behzad", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kia", "ForeName": "Vahid", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghasemi", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Shahid Behehshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razaviyan", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moosavian", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Modeling in Health Research Center, Institute for Futures Studies in Health, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezapour", "ForeName": "Maysam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vasei", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Research Center, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asouri", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi-Yeganeh", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sambucus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33845752", "10.2174/1871520621666210412113944", "ACAMC-EPUB-115267"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
