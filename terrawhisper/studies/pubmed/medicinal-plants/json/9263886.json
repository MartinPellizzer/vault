Intact guard cells were impaled with double-barrelled microelectrodes and the K+ current was monitored under voltage clamp in 0.1-30 mM K+ and in equivalent concentrations of Rb+, Cs+ and Na+. From a conditioning voltage of -200 mV, clamp steps to voltages between -150 and +50 mV in 0.1 mM K+ activated current through outward-rectifying K+ channels (IK,out) at the plasma membrane in a voltage-dependent fashion. Increasing [K+]o shifted the voltage-sensitivity of IK,out in parallel with the equilibrium potential for K+ across the membrane. A similar effect of [K+]o was evident in the kinetics of IK,out activation and deactivation, as well as the steady-state conductance-(g kappa-) voltage relations. Linear conductances, determined as a function of the conditioning voltage from instantaneous I-V curves, yielded voltages for half-maximal conductance near -130 mV in 0.1 mM K+, -80 mV in 1.0 mM K+, and -20 mV in 10 mM K+. Similar data were obtained with Rb+ and Cs+, but not with Na+, consistent with the relative efficacy of cation binding under equilibrium conditions (K+ > or = Rb+ > Cs+ > > Na+). Changing Ca2+ or Mg2+ concentrations outside between 0.1 and 10 mM was without effect on the voltage-dependence of g kappa or on IK,out activation kinetics, although 10 mM [Ca2+]o accelerated current deactivation at voltages negative of -75 mV. At any one voltage, increasing [K+]o suppressed g kappa completely, an action that showed significant cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 2. The apparent affinity for K+ was sensitive to voltage, varying from 0.5 to 20 mM with clamp voltages near -100 to 0 mV, respectively. These, and additional data indicate that extracellular K+ acts as a ligand and alters the voltage-dependence of IK,out gating; the results implicate K(+)-binding sites accessible from the external surface of the membrane, deep within the electrical field, but distinct from the channel pore; and they are consistent with a serial 4-state reaction-kinetic model for channel gating in which binding of two K+ ions outside affects the distribution between closed states of the channel."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biophysics, University of London, Kent, UK."}], "LastName": "Blatt", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gradmann", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Membr Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0211301", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2631"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cations, Monovalent"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1KSV9V4Y4I", "NameOfSubstance": "Cesium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MLT4718TJW", "NameOfSubstance": "Rubidium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cations, Monovalent"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cesium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophysiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channel Gating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Rubidium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9263886", "10.1007/s002329900261"]}}]}
