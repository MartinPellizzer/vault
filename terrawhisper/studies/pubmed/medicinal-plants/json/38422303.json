Pennisetum purpureum or elephant grass has been used for traditional medications in Indonesia without understanding the phytochemicals of those plants. Herein, our report revolves around the qualitative and quantitative examination of phytochemical components, optical properties, antioxidants, and antibacterial assessments of solvent fractions derived from Pennisetum purpureum leaf. The Pennisetum purpureum leaf was successfully soaked with ethanol, n-hexane, and chloroform. The study aimed to assess the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total alkaloid content (TAC) within different of extracts. The optical properties of extract were analyzed by absorption light and photoluminescent. Moreover, evaluation of antioxidant activities of extracts through DPPH free radical scavenging and FRAP assays, followed by an evaluation of their effectiveness in antibacterial therapy against different bacterial strains. The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical of Pennisetum purpureum presented as highest in ethanol TPC (85.5 mg GAE/g extracts), TFC (87.9 mg QE/g extracts), and TAC (86.2 mg ATE/g extracts) as compared to other solvents extract. Pennisetum purpureum extract had antioxidant capacity against DPPH radical and FRAP assay. Furthermore, each of the samples displayed antibacterial effectiveness that was dependent on the dosage towards different strains of bacteria. Our findings clearly demonstrated that Pennisetum purpureum leaf extracts grown in Indonesia containing alkaloid, flavonoid, glycoside, saponin, steroids, tannin, and terpenoids that support its capability as antioxidant and antibacterial."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8671-296X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Budiyanto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4504-3763"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Puspitarini", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7269-0384"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Prasetyo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6968-2095"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Subekti", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8112-8126"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Debre Markos University, Collage of Natural and Computational Sciences, Department of Chemistry, Debre Markos, Amhara Region, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Birhan", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4014-4124"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Qosyim", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6048-6730"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universitas Negeri Surabaya, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science, Department of Natural Science, Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Ilhami", "ForeName": "F B", "Initials": "FB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pennisetum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Devices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38422303", "10.1590/1519-6984.280855", "S1519-69842024000100492"]}}]}
