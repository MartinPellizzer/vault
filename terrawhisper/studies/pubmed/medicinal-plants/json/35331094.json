Recently, studies have shown that these carcinomas are resistant to hormone-targeted therapies, which makes it a priority to search for effective and potential anticancer drugs. The present study aimed to synthesize and develop the 2Dquantitative structural activity relationship model (QSAR) of quinoxaline derivatives as a potential anticancer agent.", "Quinoxaline derivatives were designed and synthesized (8a-8i and 9a-9d) and the 2DQSAR model against TNBC was developed using VLife MDS v4.4. The anticancer activity was investigated against the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line using an MTT cytotoxicity assay. Molecular docking studies along with the estimation of ADMET parameters were done using Discovery Studio. The most potent compound was docked against the \u03b2-tubulin protein target (PDB: 4O2B), using the Autodock Vina v0.8 program.", "Eleven derivatives of quinoxaline were designed and synthesized (8a-8i and 9a-9d) and a 2D-QSAR model was developed against the TNBC MDA-MB231 cell line. The regression coefficient values for the training set were (r<sup>2</sup>) 0.78 and (q<sup>2</sup>) 0.71. Further, external test set regression (pred_r<sup>2</sup>) was 0.68. Five molecular descriptors viz., energy dispersive (Epsilon3), protein-coding gene (T_T_C_6), molecular force field (MMFF_6), most hydrophobic hydrophilic distance (XA), and Z<sub>comp</sub> Dipole were identified. After ADMET, the best analog 8a showed the best activity against the TNBC cell line. The best-predicted hit '8a' was found to bind within the active site of the \u03b2- tubulin protein target.", "The newly synthesized quinoxaline compounds could serve as potent leads for the development of novel anti-cancer agents against TNBC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, (U.P.), India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, (U.P.), India."}], "LastName": "Kaushal", "ForeName": "Tanu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Computational Biology Unit, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CSIRCIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, (U.P.), India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, (U.P.), India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Sana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospecting Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow, 226015, (U.P.), India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, (U.P.), India."}], "LastName": "Fatima", "ForeName": "Kaneez", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospecting Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CSIR-CIMAP), Lucknow-226015 (U.P.)
