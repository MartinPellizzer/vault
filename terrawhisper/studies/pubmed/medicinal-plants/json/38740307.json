Both options heavily rely on some sort of animal cell culture, e.g. autologous stem cells. These cultures require various growth factors, such as interleukin-6 and 8 (IL-6/8), in a pure, safe and sustainable form that can be provided in a scalable manner. Plants seem well suited for this task because purification of small proteins can be readily achieved by membrane separation, human/animal pathogens do not replicate in plants and production can be scaled up using in-door farming or agricultural practices. Here, we illustrate this capacity by first optimizing the codon usage of IL-6/8 for translation in Nicotiana spp., as well as testing the effect of untranslated regions and product targeting to different sub-cellular compartments on expression in a high-throughput plant cell pack (PCP) assay. In the chloroplast, IL-6 accumulated up to 6.9\u00b13.8 (SD, n=2) and 14.4\u00b17.4\u202fmg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup> (SD, n=5) were observed in case of IL-8. When transferring IL-8 expression into whole plants, accumulation was 12.3\u00b11.5\u202fmg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup> (SD, n=3). After extraction and clarification, IL-8 was purified using a two-stage process consisting of an ultrafiltration/diafiltration step with 100\u202fkDa and 10\u202fkDa cut off membranes followed by an IMAC polishing step. The purity, yield and recovery were 97.8%, 6.6\u202fmg\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup> and 38%, respectively. We evaluated the ability of the proposed purification process to remove endotoxins to ensure the compatibility of plant-made growth factors with cell culture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
