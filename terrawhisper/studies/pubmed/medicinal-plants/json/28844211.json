The aim of this review was to determine the importance of M. communis essential oil in the treatment of hemorrhoids. For preparing this manuscript, the information was extracted from different resources. The results of clinical studies showed that M. communis essential oil (lotion or ointment) can significantly improve bleeding, permanent pain, pain during defecation, anal irritation, anal itching and anal heaviness in patients with hemorrhoids types I and II. M. communis was also effective in treating patients who did not respond to current chemical treatments (anti-hemorrhoids ointment). Further clinical studies should look into designing a suppository form of M. communis essential oil and compare its effect with the lotion and ointment forms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Medicinal Plants Research Center of Barij, Kashan 1178, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahboubi", "ForeName": "Mohaddese", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101603118"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hemorrhoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myrtus"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28844211", "10.1016/S2095-4964(17)60340-6", "S2095-4964(17)60340-6"]}}]}
