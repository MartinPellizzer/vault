The virulence of these bacteria is further strengthened by its ability to communicate within the micro-colonies through quorum sensing. Most treatments are now aimed at either elimination of this bacterium or suppression of its virulence. The emergence of antibiotic resistance among S. pyogenes and treatment failure has become an added concern globally. One of its virulence properties, biofilm formation, has made it more resistant to antibiotic therapy. This has vitalized the necessity for searching alternative therapies for its treatment. The growing research in herbal medicines has led to the discovery of various phytochemicals to limit the virulence of S. pyogenes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant, Food, and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Adil", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Khalid University, Khamis Mushait, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Rosina", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant, Food, and Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University, Truro, Nova Scotia, Canada."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada."}], "LastName": "Rupasinghe", "ForeName": "H P Vasantha", "Initials": "HPV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Metab", "NlmUniqueID": "100960533", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcal Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus pyogenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Failure"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29595103", "10.2174/1389200219666180329150551", "CDM-EPUB-89395"]}}]}
