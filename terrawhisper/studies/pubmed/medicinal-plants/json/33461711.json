In this proposed method for solid-phase microextraction, polyvinylidene fluoride fibers@polydopamine@polyethyleneimine@receptor as a solid part of the extractors were pushed into sample solution of medicinal plants, and the procedure was followed by stirring and easily dissociation of receptor binding ligands in organic solvent through pulling out of the functionalized fibers. Xanthine oxidase was chosen as the model receptor, while isoacteoside was selected as the model inhibitor. Several effecting parameters were optimized by experimental design, including temperature, ion strength and pH. Nine bioactive components were obtained from extract of Plantago depressa by using the established solid-phase micro-extraction method. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of the nine components ranged from 0.0008 to 0.03\u00a0mg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> and from 0.001 to 0.016\u00a0mg\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The RSD values of intra-day and inter-day precisions ranged from 0.24% to 2.19% and 0.62%-2.84%, respectively. The average recoveries of the nine components were from 95.06 to 104.03% with relative standard deviation (RSD) values from 1.02 to 2.90% for Plantago depressa. The RSD values of stability of the nine components ranged from 1.36% to 2.74%, which satisfied the requirements of an analytical method. In addition, surface plasmon resonance biosensor was utilized to corroborate the binding affinity between these compounds and receptor. The avidity values of these ligands corresponded well with their IC<sub>50</sub> values. The results confirmed that polydopamine and polyethyleneimine hybrid modified polyvinylidene fluoride fibers based solid-phase microextraction method was successfully utilized for locating bioactive compounds of medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
