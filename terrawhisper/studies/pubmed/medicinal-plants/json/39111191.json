Excitotoxicity is one of the most important mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological process of depression. In our previous studies, n-butanol extract from maize roots was found to have good neuroprotective effects due to its antioxidative activity. However, the antidepressive effective constituents, efficacy in vivo and mechanism of action of maize root extracts have not been determined.", "This study aimed to determine the main active neuroprotective compound in maize root extract and investigate its antidepressant effects and possible underlying mechanism in vitro and in vivo.", "Sixteen extracts were isolated and purified from maize roots. The active components of the most active extracts of maize roots (hereafter referred to as EM 2) were identified using UF-HPLC-QTOF/MS. In vitro cell models of NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells were used to analyze the anti-excitatory activity of the extracts. The MTT assay and Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection were used to evaluate cell viability. Several network pharmacological strategies have been employed to investigate the potential mechanism of action of EM 2. The effects of EM 2 on depressive-like behaviors were evaluated in CUMS mice. Changes in the levels of related proteins were detected via western blotting.", "Among the 16 extracts extracted by n-butanol, EM 2 was determined to be the most active extract against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity by n-butanol extraction. Meanwhile, seventeen compounds were further identified as the main active components of EM 2. Mechanistically, EM 2 inhibited NMDA-induced excitatory injury in SH-SY5Y cells and alleviated the depressive-like behaviors of CUMS mice by suppressing NR2B and subsequently mediating the downstream CREB/TRKB/BDNF, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, as well as the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant signaling pathway.", "The study indicated that EM 2 could potentially be developed as a potential therapeutic candidate to cure depression in NMDA-induced excitatory damage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
