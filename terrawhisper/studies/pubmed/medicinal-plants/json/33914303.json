However, genetic factors play an increasingly important role in its development. To thoroughly understand the molecular mechanisms, polymorphic variants of genes candidate for osteoporosis are still being sought. The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of NF\u03baB1 gene rs4648068 (A>G) and RUNX2 gene rs7771980 (-1025T>C) polymorphisms on the risk of osteoporosis.", "A group of 675 postmenopausal Caucasian women (109 women with osteopenia, 333 with osteoporosis and 233 with normal T-score) were examined. The bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The analysis of NF\u03baB1 and RUNX2 polymorphisms was performed using real-time PCR method.", "Analysis of NF\u03baB1 gene rs4648068 polymorphism showed that the GG genotype was slightly more frequent in the study groups compared to the control group. In the osteoporosis group, patients with the G allele in the genotype have lower bone mineral density values. For the RUNX2 rs7771980 polymorphism, in women with osteopenia we observed an increased incidence of TC heterozygotes compared to the control group (29.40% vs 24.90%, p > 0.05), and in women with osteoporosis, the TT genotype was more common (78.70% vs 73.80%, p > 0.05). No correlation was observed between the genotypes and the clinical parameters.", "The analysis showed no significant relationship between the genotypic distribution and the individual clinical parameters. However, it is suggested an association between the rs4648068 polymorphism of the NF\u03baB1 gene and an increased risk of developing osteoporosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland. aniabogacz23@o2.pl."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Histocompatibility with Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Regional Blood Center, Poznan, Poland. aniabogacz23@o2.pl."}], "LastName": "Bogacz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Gorska", "ForeName": "Aleksandra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinic of Pediatric Orthopedics, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kaminski", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Wolek", "ForeName": "Marlena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Perinatology and Women's Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Podhale Multidisciplinary Hospital, Nowy Targ, Poland."}], "LastName": "Wolski", "ForeName": "Hubert", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Perinatology and Women's Diseases, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Independent Laboratory of Invasive Cardiology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Goracy", "ForeName": "Jaroslaw", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Poznan, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacoeconomics, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Czerny", "ForeName": "Boguslaw", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ginekol Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374641", "ISSNLinking": "0017-0011"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "39"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33914303", "10.5603/GP.a2021.0044", "VM/OJS/J/69242"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
