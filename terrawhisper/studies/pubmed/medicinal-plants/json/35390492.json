Using glyphosate as selection pressure, transgenic homozygous plants of A. belladonna are generated, in which a novel calmodulin gene (AbCaM1) and a reported EPSPS gene (G2-EPSPS) are co-overexpressed. AbCaM1 is highly expressed in secondary roots of A. belladonna and has calcium-binding activity. Three transgenic homozygous lines were generated and their glyphosate tolerance and TAs' production were evaluated in the field. Transgenic homozygous lines produced TAs at much higher levels than wild-type plants. In the leaves of T2GC02, T2GC05, and T2GC06, the hyoscyamine content was 8.95-, 10.61-, and 9.96\u00a0mg/g DW, the scopolamine content was 1.34-, 1.50- and 0.86\u00a0mg/g DW, respectively. Wild-type plants of A. belladonna produced hyoscyamine and scopolamine respectively at the levels of 2.45\u00a0mg/g DW and 0.30\u00a0mg/g DW in leaves. Gene expression analysis indicated that AbCaM1 significantly up-regulated seven key TA biosynthesis genes. Transgenic homozygous lines could tolerate a commercial recommended dose of glyphosate in the field. In summary, new varieties of A. belladonna not only produce pharmaceutical TAs at high levels but tolerate glyphosate, facilitating industrial production of TAs and weed management at a much lower cost."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 International Metabolic Engineering Society.
