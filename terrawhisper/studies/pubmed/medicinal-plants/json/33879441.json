In vitro evaluation was performed by using disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations were noted while rat models were selected for in vivo activity against four Helicobacter pylori strains isolated form gastric mucosa. Mentha piperita showed largest zone of inhibition with 9 mm diameter among all other extracts. All the plants showed promising anti-Helicobacter pylori activity against four isolates and a reference strain at concentrations of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/ml in comparison with Amoxicillin 1 \u03bcg/ml but least MIC was exhibited by Mentha piperita followed by in vivo testing where it competed Amoxicillin at 1000 mg/kg by achieving 80% eradication of Helicobacter pylori in mucosa of infected rats justified by histological examination of stomach. It was concluded that medicinal plants possess strong anti-Helicobacter pylori activity and can be considered a potential source of safe and effective alternative regimens for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, AJ&K, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zahid", "ForeName": "Rabia", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Medicine & Allied Health Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asif", "ForeName": "Hafiz Muhammad", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BreathMAT Lab, Nuclear Medicine, Oncology and Radiotherapy Institute, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rasheed", "ForeName": "Faisal", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BreathMAT Lab, Nuclear Medicine, Oncology and Radiotherapy Institute, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rashid", "ForeName": "Faizan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad."}], "LastName": "Kamran", "ForeName": "Rubina", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences, Jeddah, KSA."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Kanwal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences, Jeddah, KSA."}], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Sheikh Abdul", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Jibran Sualeh", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Directorate of Medical Science, GC University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University of Health Sciences, Jeddah, KSA."}], "LastName": "Zaidi", "ForeName": "Syed Faisal", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter pylori"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33879441"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
