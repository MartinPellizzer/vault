Eighty-two patients with chronic refractory schizophrenia were studied. Forty-three patients were treated with haloperidol plus extract of ginkgo biloba (group 1), and 39 received haloperidol plus placebo (group 2). SOD levels of these patients were measured before and after treatment and were compared with SOD levels of 30 healthy volunteers. Therapeutic efficiency was equated with a change in clinical rating scores assessed by standardized measurement tools that included the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) over this period. Patients in group 1 improved significantly as demonstrated by scores from these two assessment instruments; those in group 2 improved significantly only as shown by scores on SANS. SOD levels before treatment in all patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls; after treatment, the SOD level decreased significantly in group 1 but not in group 2. These results suggest that EGb may enhance the efficiency of the classic antipsychotic haloperidol in patients with schizophrenia, especially on their positive symptoms, and that EGb may work through an antioxidant effect that is involved in the therapeutic mechanism in patients with chronic refractory schizophrenia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Mental Health, Beijing Medical University, People's Republic of China. zhangxy99@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "P Y", "Initials": "PY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Psychopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "8109496", "ISSNLinking": "0271-0749"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J6292F8L3D", "NameOfSubstance": "Haloperidol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Haloperidol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Schizophrenia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11199954", "10.1097/00004714-200102000-00015"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
