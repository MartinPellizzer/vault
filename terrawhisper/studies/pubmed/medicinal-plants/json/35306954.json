Isorhamnetin (ISO) is a flavonoid compound isolated and purified from medicinal plants, such as <i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L. and Ginkgo, and has multiple pharmacological functions, such as anti-tumor, anti-myocardial hypoxia, and cardiovascular protection. Our previous study has shown that ISO could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury in mice, but its mechanism is not clear.<b>Methods:</b> In this study, we used LPS-induced mouse and cell models to research the mechanism of ISO alleviating acute lung injury.<b>Results:</b> The results showed that ISO could attenuate the injury of type II alveolar epithelial cells by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway. Further studies showed that ISO could inhibit the activation of mTOR signal <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> and <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and promote autophagy in alveolar epithelial cells to reduce lung injury caused by LPS. In addition, ISO could inhibit LPS-induced epithelial cell apoptosis.<b>Conclusion:</b> Overall, ISO could suppress injury and apoptosis of epithelial cells and activate autophagy to protect epithelial cells <i>via</i> inhibiting mTOR signal and attenuating LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
