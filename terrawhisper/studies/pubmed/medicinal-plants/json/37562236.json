However, despite the fervent efforts invested in recent clinical trials, a considerable number of these studies have produced outcomes that are deemed unsatisfactory. It is noteworthy that the trials that have yielded the most satisfactory outcomes have exhibited a shared characteristic, namely, the existence of a mechanism for the regulated administration of growth factors. Despite the extensive exploration of drug delivery vehicles and their efficacy in delivering certain growth factors, the development of a reliable predictive approach for the delivery of delicate growth factors like Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) remains elusive. VEGF plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis; however, the administration of VEGF demands a meticulous approach as it necessitates precise localization and transportation to a specific target tissue. This process requires prolonged and sustained exposure to a low concentration of VEGF. Inaccurate administration of drugs, either through off-target effects or inadequate delivery, may heighten the risk of adverse reactions and potentially result in tumorigenesis. At present, there is a scarcity of technologies available for the accurate encapsulation of VEGF and its subsequent sustained and controlled release. The objective of this review is to present and assess diverse categories of VEGF administration mechanisms. This paper examines various systems, including polymeric, liposomal, hydrogel, inorganic, polyplexes, and microfluidic, and evaluates the appropriate dosage of VEGF for multiple applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
