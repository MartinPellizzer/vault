Atherosclerosis is one of the leading causes of morbidity and disability in type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes patients. Atherosclerosis risk in diabetic patients is obviously higher than that of non-diabetic individuals. Diabetes-related glycolipid metabolism disorder has been shown to play a central role in atherosclerosis development and progression. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia increase the risks for atherosclerosis and plaque necrosis through multiple signaling pathways, such as a prolonged increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory factors in cardiovascular cells. Notwithstanding the great advances in the understanding of the pathologies of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, the current medical treatments for diabetic atherosclerosis hold undesirable side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to identify novel therapeutic targets or alternative strategies to prevent or treat diabetic atherosclerosis. Burgeoning evidence suggests that plant and herbal medicines are closely linked with healthy benefits for diabetic complications, including diabetic atherosclerosis. In this review, we will overview the utilization of plant and herbal medicines for the treatment of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of the ethnopharmacological therapeutic potentials against diabetic atherosclerosis are gathered and reviewed. It is foreseeable that the natural constituents from medicinal plants might be a new hope for the treatment of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).
