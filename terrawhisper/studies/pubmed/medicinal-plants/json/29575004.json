To further evaluate its medicinal potential, a sensitive and robust LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the assay of ikarisoside A in rat plasma. Orientin was used as an internal standard. The electrospray ionization was operated in its negative ion mode while ikarisoside A and IS were measured by selected reaction monitoring using precursor-to-product ion transitions of m/z 499.1\u2009\u2192\u2009353.0 and m/z 446.9\u2009\u2192\u2009327.6, respectively. This LC-MS/MS method had good sensitivity (LLOQ\u2009=\u20091.5\u2009ng/mL), accuracy (both intra- and inter-day RE\u2009\u2264\u2009\u00b111.9%) and precision (both intra- and inter-day RSD \u22648.5%). The pharmacokinetics of ikarisoside A was subsequently profiled in Sprague-Dawley rats. Following oral administration (35\u2009mg/kg), ikarisoside A reached maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> , 207.6\u2009\u00b1\u200996.7\u2009ng/mL) attained at 1.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42\u2009h. Following oral administration, the clearance and terminal half-life were 42.9\u2009\u00b1\u200926.5\u2009L/h/kg and 3.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.80\u2009h by oral route, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ocular Fundus Disease, the Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Cong", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6488-8825"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology, the First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ikarisoside A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linear Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29575004", "10.1002/bmc.4245"]}}]}
