Therefore, new leads with activity on adult parasites are highly desirable.", "Anti-filarial lead optimization by semi-synthetic modification of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA).", "The GA was first converted into 3-O-acyl derivative, which was further converted into 12 amide derivatives. All these derivatives were assessed for their antifilarial potential by parasite motility assay. The binding affinity of active GA derivatives on trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (Bm-TPP) was assessed by molecular docking studies.", "Among 15 GA derivatives, GAD-2, GAD-3, and GAD-4 were found more potent than the GA and standard drug DEC. These derivatives reduced the motility of Brugia malayi adult worms by up to 74% while the GA and DEC reduced only up to 49%. Further, GA and most of its derivatives exhibited two times more reduction in MTT assay when compared to the standard drug DEC. These derivatives also showed 100% reduction of microfilariae and good interactions with Bm-TPP protein.", "The present study suggests that 3-O-acyl and linear chain amide derivatives of glycyrrhetinic acid may be potent leads against B. malayi microfilariae and adult worms. These results might be helpful in developing QSAR model for optimizing a new class of antifilarial lead from a very common, inexpensive, and non toxic natural product."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "Rekha", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Surjeet", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Parasitology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Shikha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Parasitology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226031, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Mrigank", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic & Structural Biology Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Sarfaraz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic & Structural Biology Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Feroz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Department, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Santosh Kumar", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Filaricides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P540XA09DR", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Brugia malayi"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Filaricides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhetinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neglected Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31210109", "10.2174/1568026619666190618141450", "CTMC-EPUB-98985"]}}]}
