In order to determine its effects on maternal and infant health, a group of 400 Papua-New Guinean women was comprised of those who had made at least 1 prenatal visit, taken no drugs in pregnancy aside from chloroquine and hematinics, did not smoke or drink alcohol, had a single pregnancy, and gave a clear history of having chewed betel throughout the pregnancy. The test was performed from April-June 1981 and a control was found of women who had never chewed betel. Each patient was seen in labor and the baby was examined after delivery, on the 1st day postpartum, and throughout the lying-in period (2-23 days) with regard to congenital anomalies and respiratory difficulties. In the antenatal period no differences in hemoglobin value, preeclampsia, or labor were noted as significant (P0.05). Fetal distress was the same in each group and Agpar scores were similar as well. Babies born to betel chewing mothers had a mean weight of 2998.5 gm with a standard deviation of 492.5 gm. Nonchewing mothers' babies had a mean weight of 3079.5 gm and standard deviation was 464.1 gm, a significant difference. The occurrence of congenital anomalies was not different in the 2 groups and no baby was found in either group to show the irritability common in narcotic withdrawal syndromes. 51 infants in the study group developed mild neonatal jaundice compared with 79 in the control group. Possibly some substance in the betel chew is an inducer of glucuronyl transferase. The difference in the overall incidence of jaundice is significant (P0.001). Even though mean birth weight of betel-chewing mothers was lower than the control group, the babies were healthy in other aspects. The study does not indicate a need to dissuade mothers from chewing betel, and there may even be some benefit in this habit as regards jaundice reduction."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["009466", "00110795"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Age Factors", "Asia", "Biology", "Birth Weight", "Congenital Abnormalities", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Health", "Health Services", "Hepatic Effects", "India", "Infant", "Infant Mortality", "Jaundice", "Maternal Health Services", "Maternal-child Health Services", "Melanesia", "Mortality", "Neonatal Mortality", "Oceania", "Papua New Guinea", "Physiology", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Population Dynamics", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Primary Health Care", "Reproduction", "Signs And Symptoms", "Youth"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6954939", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "09", "Day": "17"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "29"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0004-8666", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "22", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1982", "Month": "Feb"}}, "Title": "The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Effects of betel chewing on pregnancy outcome.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "22", "EndPage": "24", "MedlinePgn": "22-4"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["The antenatal records of 400 Papua New Guinean women who had chewed betel throughout pregnancy were examined and the patients' performance in labour and the condition of the baby at birth and in the post-natal period were studied.
