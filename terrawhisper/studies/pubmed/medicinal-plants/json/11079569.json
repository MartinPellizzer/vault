Latex is the milky-like fluid within laticifer cells. In this study, poppy latex was analyzed with respect to ultrastructure, alkaloid, and protein content. The main goal of this project was the examination of the proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In a proteomics approach, we investigated two main fractions of the latex, namely the cytosolic serum and the sedimented fraction containing the alkaloid-accumulating vesicles. Of the serum, representing the protein-rich part of the latex, 75 spots were analyzed by internal peptide microsequencing, followed by a database searching. For 69 proteins a function could be assigned due to homology to known proteins, whereas six spots could not be identified. Furthermore, codeinone reductase, a representative of the specific enzyme system in morphine biosynthesis, could be detected within the cytosolic serum fraction. In the vesicle-containing pellet, 23 protein spots were analyzed. An attempt was also made to separate the vesicle pellet by density centrifugation, followed by investigation of the alkaloid content, ultrastructure, and protein pattern. This study describes the first database of soluble proteins present in the latex of P. somniferum"]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Analytical Protein Chemistry Group, Martinsried, Germany. decker@biochem.mpg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Decker", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wanner", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zenk", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lottspeich", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Electrophoresis", "NlmUniqueID": "8204476", "ISSNLinking": "0173-0835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Latex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Latex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11079569", "10.1002/1522-2683(20001001)21:16<3500::AID-ELPS3500>3.0.CO;2-O", "10.1002/1522-2683(20001001)21:16<3500::AID-ELPS3500>3.0.CO;2-O"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
