Human studies are now beginning to provide insights into the significance of the potential health benefits of CHS in a dietary context, particularly concerning their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and their impact on glucose homeostasis, appetite and the consumption of low/reduced fat, salt and sugar foods. However, these studies have also identified a number of factors that are very pertinent to furthering understanding of how CHS can be used for the maintenance of health and the prevention of CNCDs. The challenge for the next phase of studies will be how to incorporate, successfully, these factors into study methodology for investigating the preventative benefits of these foods. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9687-0315"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Pharmacy and Chemistry, Kingston University, Kingston upon Thames, UK."}], "LastName": "Opara", "ForeName": "Elizabeth I", "Initials": "EI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Noncommunicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30815875", "10.1002/jsfa.9658"]}}]}
