Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be specifically prepared for the patient, was considered as cells in this study, and Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) as a most interesting polymer in biomedical applications was applied to the scaffold fabrication by electrospinning. After scaffold characterization, SMC differentiation potential of the human iPSCs was investigated while cultured on the PLGA nanofibrous scaffold by evaluation of the SMC related important gene and protein markers. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (ASMA), Smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM-22a) as two early SMC markers were significantly up regulated either two and three weeks after differentiation induction in human iPSCs cultured on PLGA compared to those cells cultured on the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). But Calponin-1, Caldesmon1 and myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression differences in human iPSCs cultured on PLGA and TCPS were significant only three weeks after differentiation induction based on its lately expression in the differentiation process. ASMA and MHC proteins were also considered for evaluation by immunocytochemistry on differentiated iPSCs whereas results showed higher expression of these proteins in stem cells grown on PLGA compared to the TCPS. According to the results, human iPSCs demonstrated a great SMC differentiation potential when grown on PLGA and it could be considered as a promising cell-co-polymer for use in bladder tissue engineering."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
