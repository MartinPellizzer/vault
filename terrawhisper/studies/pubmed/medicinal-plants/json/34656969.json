The cytotoxicity of these analogs toward different cancer cell lines was investigated in vitro. The new TD compounds showed potent inhibitory activities toward prostate cancer (PC3), leukemia (K562), breast cancer (MDA-231), lung cancer (A549), and cervical cancer (Hela) cell lines. Among them, TD1, TD11, and TD17 showed excellent broad-spectrum cytotoxic effects on five cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle phase. Besides, TD1, TD11, and TD17 could target-bind with NQO1 protein in the prostate cancer cells PC3 leukemia cells K562. The results showed that removing the methyl group at C-3 and introducing 1,2,3-triazoles at the C-2 terminal of the furan ring were effective strategies for improving the broad-spectrum anticancer activity of L-shaped ortho-quinone analogs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
