Some of the dextran treated mice were given AERA (20 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) as AERA group, other mice were given AEFC (10 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) as AEFC group. Some of the dextran treated mice were given water as model group, some normal mice as normal control group. After a 12 weeks' treatment, 24 hour urine of four groups was collected, respectively. Each urinary sample was divided into two parts, one was non-concentrated urine sample, another was used as concentrated urine sample. Two kinds of urinary sample of four groups were analyzed with microfluidic chips on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument.", "Each group's urinary protein patterns were obtained, more than 20 proteins were were detected. Compared with normal group, about five kinds of protein were found in urinary sample of model group, among which M > 43 x 10(3) proteins were increased. Compared with model group, significant treated-related protein's kind and quantitative changes in AERA treated group and AEFC group were found. Urinary protein kinds were reduced, especially certain the proteins (M > 50 x 10(3)) were significantly decreased approach to normal patterns. Non-concentrated urine samples' protein pattern mainly included were proteins (M=29, 32, 43, 52, 68, 76 x 10(3) and concentrated urine samples mainly included the proteins (M=22, 24, 32, 46 x 10(3)).", "AERA and AEFC could reduce the urinary protein and made protein pattern different, which showed that radix astragali and fructus corni could play an important role in protecting renal function of nephropathy mice and finding the target protein markers related to AERA and AEFC effects on nephropathy mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Separation Science Institute, Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Education Ministry, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710049, China. limingdawn71@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Li-ming", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Xiao-qiang", "Initials": "XQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dextrans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cornus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dextrans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microfluidic Analytical Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nephritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["urine"], "DescriptorName": "Proteinuria"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17879737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
