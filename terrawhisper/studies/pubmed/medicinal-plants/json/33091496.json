Surgery is the main treatment approach while other options are also associated with adverse effects. There is therefore a need for the development of better alternative therapy that is cost effective and readily available with little or no adverse effect. Some bioactive agents in medicinal plants exhibit their anti-proliferative potential by induction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPT) opening. Gloriosa superba, a medicinal plant, is folklorically used in the treatment of tumors and cancers.", "This study therefore aimed at investigating the effect of ethanol leaf extract of Gloriosa superba (EEGS) on mPT and monosodium glutamate-induced proliferative disorder in some specific tissues using rat model.", "Isolated rat liver mitochondria were exposed to different concentrations (10, 30, 50, 70 and 90\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of EEGS. The mPT pore opening, cytochrome c release, mitochondrial ATPase activity and lipid peroxidation were assessed spectrophotometrically. Caspases 9 and 3 activities were carried out using ELISA technique. Histological assessment of the liver, prostate and uterus of normal and monosodium glutamate (MSG)-treated rats were carried out.", "The results showed significant induction of mPT pore opening, release of cytochrome c, enhancement of mitochondrial ATPase activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and activation of caspases 9 and 3 activities by EEGS. The histological assessment revealed the presence of MSG-induced hepato-cellular damage, benign prostate hyperplasia and uterine hyperplasia which were ameliorated by EEGS co-administration.", "These findings suggest that EEGS contains putative agents that can induce apoptosis via induction of mPT pore opening and as well protect against MSG-induced hepato-cellular damage and proliferative disorder in prostate and uterus."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
