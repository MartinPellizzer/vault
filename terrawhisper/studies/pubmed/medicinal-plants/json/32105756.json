The most prevalent form, type 2 DM, is characterized by insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction, whereas type 1 DM is due to insulin deficiency as a result of \u03b2-cell destruction. Various classes of synthetic drugs have been developed to regulate glucose homeostasis and combat the development of late-diabetic complications. However, several of these chemical agents are either sub-optimal in their effect and/or may have side effects. Biologically, alkaloids unveiled a wide range of therapeutic effects including anti-diabetic properties. The chemical backbones of these compounds have the potential to interact with a wide range of proteins involved in glucose homeostasis, and thus they have received increasing attention as reliable candidates for drug development. This review sets out to investigate the anti-diabetic potential of plant alkaloids (PAs), and therefore, scientific databases were comprehensively screened to highlight the biological activity of 78 PAs with a considerable anti-diabetic profile. There are not enough clinical data available for these phytochemicals to follow their fingerprint in human, but current studies generally recommending PAs as potent \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors. Except for some classes of monoterpene alkaloids, other compounds showed similar features as well as the presently available anti-diabetic drugs such as amino sugars and other relevant drugs. Moreover, the evidence suggests that PAs have the potential to be used as alternative additives for the treatment of DM, however, further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate these findings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
