Extracts from B. serrata gum were shown to inhibit leukotriene biosynthesis by impairing the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activity. In order to identify the minimal effective concentrations of extracts in vitro we studied the effects of ethanolic extracts from commercially available resins from two regions (B. serrata gum from India and Olibanum in granis from Arabia) on the 5-LO product formation from endogenous substrate in calcium and ionophore stimulated neutrophils in a defined concentration range. Both extracts inhibited 5-LO product formation in vitro in concentrations greater than 10 to 15 micrograms/ml as reported previously for an ethanolic B. serrata extract. In contrast, lower concentrations of extracts (1 to 10 micrograms/ml) even potentiated 5-LO product formation, especially the biosynthesis of 5(S)-HETE. The in vitro data underline the major importance of drug standardization when Boswellia resin containing preparations are used for the treatment of diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Tuebingen, Germany. hasan.safayhi@uni-tuebingen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Safayhi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boden", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schweizer", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ammon", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.34", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophil Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10763581", "10.1055/s-2000-11136"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
