After the pharmacy liquor was decocted, equivalent dose for rat was calculated. According to the weights, all rats were intragastric administrated at the standard of 1 mL x 100 g(-1), twice a day, continuously for 3 days. One hour after the last administration, the serum was collected and mixed with culture media RPMI 1640 to prepare the drug serum incubation liquid at the concentration of 10%.
