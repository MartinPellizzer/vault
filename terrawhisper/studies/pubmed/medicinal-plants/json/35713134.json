It is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions which interfere with the individual's life and functioning. Although conventional treatments such as drug therapies and cognitive behavioral therapy exist for OCD, these treatments are not universally successful and can cause side effects, which has created a demand for alternative and complementary therapies.", "In this review, we summarize randomized clinical trials on the effectiveness of herbal medicines for the treatment of OCD, and review the possible mechanisms of action for these medicines. A search in PubMed, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library found 1022 studies, of which 7 were included in our review.", "The studies that we found were conducted over 6 to 12 weeks, and had an average sample size of 37. The plant species studied included Crocus sativus, Echium amoenum, Hypericum perforatum, Silybum marianum, Valeriana officinalis, and Withania somnifera. The trials demonstrated the effectiveness of all plants as treatments for OCD except H. perforatum. The phytochemicals found in these plants produce their effects through a variety of means such as inhibiting the reuptake of monoamines, GABAergic effects, and neuroendocrine modulation. The small number of studies and their small sample sizes, poor methodology, and lack of replication highlight the need for further research into herbal medicines for the treatment of OCD.", "Overall, herbal medicines can be used as stand-alone therapies for OCD or in conjunction with other methods."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abrishami", "ForeName": "Maryam Hosseini", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Noras", "ForeName": "Mohamad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soltanifar", "ForeName": "Atefeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Persian Pharmacy, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salari", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jarahi", "ForeName": "Lida", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Persian Medicine Research Center, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pazhouh", "ForeName": "Hamideh Khorram", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35713134", "10.2174/1570163819666220616122543", "CDDT-EPUB-124541"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
