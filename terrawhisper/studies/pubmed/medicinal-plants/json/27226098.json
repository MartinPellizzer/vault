All the analysis was performed in multiple sets. Various statistical methods like principal component analysis, dendogram, Euclidean distance and correlation study were done to compare the phytochemical profile of C. infortunatum with different selected medicinal plants belonging to different families.", "Results indicated the presence of various phytochemicals like phenol, alkaloid, flavonoid, tannin, thiamine, riboflavin, etc. Among the estimated phytochemicals, phenol had the highest quantity (65.59\u00b11.26 mg/g) followed by lipid (27.51\u00b10.23 mg/g) and tannin (16.40\u00b10.07 mg/100 g). The phytochemical contents of C. infortunatum are much higher than those of the other reference plants.", "It may be concluded from the present study that the root of C. infortunatum contains very high amount of phytochemicals which are chiefly responsible for various medicinal properties. Therefore, the presence of the bioactive compounds in high quantity may lead to the potent medicinal value of C. infortunatum root."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "Somit", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guha", "ForeName": "Pokhraj", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dey", "ForeName": "Priyankar", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chaudhuri", "ForeName": "Tapas Kumar", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "9101750", "ISSNLinking": "0792-6855"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Clerodendrum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27226098", "10.1515/jbcpp-2015-0086", "/j/jbcpp.ahead-of-print/jbcpp-2015-0086/jbcpp-2015-0086.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
