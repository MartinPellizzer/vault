Cusson. The crude extract was obtained by extraction with ethanol from the dried fruits of Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson under sonication. Preparative HSCCC with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (5:5:5:5, v/v/v/v) was successfully performed by increasing the flow-rate of the mobile phase stepwise from 1.0 to 2.0 ml min(-1) after 180 min. The components purified and collected were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The method yielded 45.8 mg of bergapten at 96.5% purity and 118.3 mg of imperatorin at 98.2% purity from 500 mg of the crude extract in a single run. The recoveries of bergapten and imperatorin were 92.1 and 93.7%, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The University ofHong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lia", "ForeName": "Hua-Bin", "Initials": "HB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furocoumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4FVK84C92X", "NameOfSubstance": "5-Methoxypsoralen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K713N25C78", "NameOfSubstance": "imperatorin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U4VJ29L7BQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Methoxsalen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "5-Methoxypsoralen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cnidium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Countercurrent Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Furocoumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Methoxsalen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15633744", "10.1016/j.chroma.2004.10.091", "S0021-9673(04)01968-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
