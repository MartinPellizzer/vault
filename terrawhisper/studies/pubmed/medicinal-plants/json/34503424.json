A significant part of these pursuits and efforts focus on medicinal herbs and plant components derived from these plants. A. ketenoglui is one of these medicinal plants, and its anticancer potential has never been studied before.", "The phenolic and flavonoid content, and antioxidant activity of A. ketenoglui extracts were determined. The phytochemical profiling and quantification analysis of major components were performed by HPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated to reveal the anticancer activity of the extract on CRC cells (HCT 116 and HT-29). The determined anticancer activity was confirmed by mRNA (RT-qPCR) and protein (Western blotting) analyzes.", "A. ketenoglui methanol extract was found to have high phenolic (281.89\u00b10.23) and flavonoid (33.80\u00b10.15) content and antioxidant activity (IC<sub>50</sub> 40.03\u00b10.38). According to the XTT assay, the extract has strong cytotoxic activity (IC50 350 \u03bcM in HCT 116 and IC<sub>50</sub> 263 \u03bcM in HT-29 cell line). The compounds most commonly found in the plant are, in descending order, chlorogenic acid, apigenin, genistin, baicalin, eupatorin, casticin, and luteolin. In flowcytometric analysis, the extract was found to induce greater apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in both cell lines than in both control and positive control (casticin). According to the results of the mRNA expression analysis, the extract treatment upregulated the expression of the critical genes of the cell cycle and apoptosis, such as p53, p21, caspase-3, and caspase-9. In protein expression analysis, an increase in caspase-3 and p53 expression was observed in both cell lines treated with the extract. In addition, caspase-9 expression was increased in HT-29 cells.", "The findings show that A. ketenoglui has an anticancer potential by inducing apoptosis and arresting the cancer cell cycle and may be promising for CRC therapy. This potential of the plant is realized through the synergistic effects of its newly identified components."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ayan", "ForeName": "\u0130lknur \u00c7", "Initials": "\u0130\u00c7"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center of Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Yenimahalle, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u00c7etinkaya", "ForeName": "S\u00fcmeyra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dursun", "ForeName": "Hatice G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biology, Meram Faculty of Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University, Meram, Konya, Turkey."}], "LastName": "G\u00fcne\u015f", "ForeName": "Canan E", "Initials": "CE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Gazi University, Teknikokullar, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "\u015eirin", "ForeName": "Seda", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 9"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Achillea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 9"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colorectal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34503424", "10.2174/1871520621666210908110422", "ACAMC-EPUB-117753"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
