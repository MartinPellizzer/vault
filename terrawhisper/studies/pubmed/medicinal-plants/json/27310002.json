Most of the metabolic and physiological processes of our body as well as the detoxification of various drugs and xenobiotic chemicals occur in the liver. During this detoxification process, the reactive chemical intermediates damage the liver causing hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the maintenance of a healthy liver is vital to overall health. Unfortunately, the liver is often abused by environmental toxins, poor eating habits, alcohol, and prescription and over-the-counter drug use, which lead to liver diseases like hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The available synthetic drugs to treat liver disorders in this condition also cause further damage to the liver on long-term use. Hence, Ayurvedic plants have become increasingly popular and their use is widespread. Various Ayurvedic formulations are available in market to treat liver disease. Also there is increase in the export of Ayurvedic plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Valvi", "ForeName": "Anupama R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mouriya", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Athawale", "ForeName": "Rajani B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhatt", "ForeName": "Narendra S", "Initials": "NS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "5", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27310002", "10.1515/jcim-2015-0110", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2015-0110/jcim-2015-0110.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
