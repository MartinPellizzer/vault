Water extract reduced NPD as well as 2-AF induced his+ revertants significantly but did not have any perceptible effect against sodium azide included his+ revertants in TA100 and TA1535 strains of S. typhimurium. The pre-incubation studies, where the extract was incubated at 37 degrees C for 30 min with the said mutagen prior to plating, enhanced the inhibitory effect. Autoclaving the water extract reduced the inhibitory effect but the reduction in the effect was not significant. No inhibitory effect was observed in any of the strains and against any of the test mutagens with chloroform extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botanical Sciences, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India."}], "LastName": "Grover", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bala", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V31YC746X", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroform"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chloroform"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1459604"]}}]}
