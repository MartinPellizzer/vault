In order to clarify the influence of storage conditions on the pigment components in flowers, two conditions were applied:temperature and illumination. The contents of pigments in the D. catenatum flower were determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and HPLC, and the changes of them during storage were analyzed. The results showed that illumination and temperature had an effect on the pigments of D. catenatum flower during sto-rage. Illumination significantly promoted the degradation of pigments. The contents of total chlorophyll, carotenoids and anthocyanins in the light samples were significantly lower than those in the dark. The total chlorophyll, carotenoids and anthocyanins in the light samples were decreased by 46.5%, 63.4%, and 69.2% respectively. Illumination had a greater effect on fat-soluble pigments than water-soluble pigments. Among the three temperature treatments, the contents of chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin were as follows:-20 \u2103&gt;4 \u2103&gt;room temperature, it is indicated that-20 \u2103 was the best temperature to maintain the stability of pigment composition. The contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, \u03b2-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin in the light samples decreased by 34.8%, 69.0%, 72.5%, 61.6%, 36.1%, respectively. After storage for 5 months, the contents of chlorophyll, carotenoid and anthocyanin constituent at-20 \u2103 was significantly higher than those at 4 \u2103 and room temperature. The results show that light avoiding and low-temperature can effectively slow down the degradation of pigment components. Therefore, it is suggested that D. catenatum flower should be stored in light avoiding and low-temperature conditions in actual production and processing, which can prolong the usable time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Bei-Bei", "Initials": "BB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xin-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A & F University Lin'an 311300, China."}], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Jin-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Storage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32237483", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20191204.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
