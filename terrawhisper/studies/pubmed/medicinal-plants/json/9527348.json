The results showed that sulphur, nitrogen and chicken manure treatments significantly (p < or = 0.05) increased yield, 100-seed weight, non-soakers, and hydration coefficient, in the absence of Rhizobium inoculation. The results also showed that Rhizobium inoculation significantly (p < or = 0.05) increased yield, 100-seed weight, cookability, but decreased non-soakers. A positive correlation (r = 0.90) was observed between the non-soaker percent and the total defect percent. No correlation was found between non-soakers, hydration coefficient and cookability. The results of this investigation indicate that Rhizobium inoculation is a promising fertilizer because it is cheap, easy to handle and improves plant growth and seed quality. The efficiency of inoculation could be improved with the addition of biological, chemical or organic fertilizers. Generally, fertilization of faba bean with nitrogen, sulphur or chicken manure not only increased plant growth and yield, but also improved seed quality and nutritional value."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Soil Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Shambat, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Elsheikh", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elzidany", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Manure"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70FD1KFU70", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Manure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sudan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "World J Microbiol Biotechnol. 1995 Mar;11(2):223-7", "ArticleIdList": ["24414508"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1995 Apr;47(3):257-63", "ArticleIdList": ["7659703"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9527348", "10.1023/a:1007937614660"]}}]}
