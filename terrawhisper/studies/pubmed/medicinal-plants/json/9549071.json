The procedure for extraction and purification is a simplified version of that used in the current official method for analysis of these products. LC separations are performed on a normal-phase column. The mobile phase is methanol to which a small volume of an aqueous solution of 1-pentanesulfonic acid sodium salt can be added to achieve desired elution characteristics. Reserpine and rescinnamine elute at approximately the same time but can be individually quantitated by appropriate settings of the fluorescence detector. Reserpine is determined at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 360 nm, because rescinnamine is completely non-fluorescent at these wavelengths. Rescinnamine is determined at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 435 nm, because reserpine is completely nonfluorescent at these wavelengths. The following materials were used for the study: one sample of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standard R. serpentine powder, one tablet type labeled as containing 100 mg R. serpentine and 2 tablet types labeled as containing 50 mg R. serpentine. For each of the 4 materials, 2 pairs of blind duplicates were prepared. Three materials were analyzed in duplicate by 8 laboratories. One of the 2 tablets labeled to contain 50 mg R. serpentine was analyzed only by 7 of 8 participating laboratories. Average combined content of reserpine and rescinnamine was 0.144% for the USP raw material and 0.132, 0.135, and 0.137% for the 3 commercial tablets. Reproducibility relative standard deviation values were 5.72, 5.93, 8.61, and 3.48% and repeatability relative standard deviation values were 2.57, 4.87, 3.19, and 1.99% for the 4 samples. The Associate Referee conducted a study to determine recoveries of reserpine plus rescinnamine by this method from mixtures simulating sample extracts. Average recovery of 15 determinations was 100.1%, with a relative standard deviation of 1.3%. The LC method for determination of reserpine and rescinnamine in R. serpentine powders and tablets has been adopted first action by AOAC INTERNATIONAL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Philadelphia, PA 19106, USA."}], "LastName": "Cieri", "ForeName": "U R", "Initials": "UR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Solutions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8B1QWR724A", "NameOfSubstance": "Reserpine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q6W1F7DJ2D", "NameOfSubstance": "rescinnamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Solutions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rauwolfia"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Reserpine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9549071"]}}]}
