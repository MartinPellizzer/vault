Launched in July, 1979, the project will continue through May, 1982. The study is sponsored by the World Health Organization. More than 100 pounds of each plant sample are needed for the pharmacological and phytochemical tests. 300 plant species will be studied, which represents only a fraction of the almost 4000 species for which fertility-regulating information has been gathered. In 1974 Americans paid about $3 billion for prescriptions of plant-extracted drugs. In the same year the pharmaceutical companies devoted only $200,000 of a $1 million research effort to the study of plant extracts. The plant data are being analyzed and stored with the help of a computer system developed at the Illinois College of Pharmacy. The Natural Products Alert (NAPRALERT) system considers whether or not a plant is poisonous or has adverse side effects. An estimated 5000 scientific periodicals are computerized per year. Some 4000 plants are listed, but another 4000 with fertility regulation potential are expected to be recorded. Some 750,000 species of flowering plants grow on earth."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["795757", "00071469"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: American Pharmacy"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Health", "Health Services", "International Agencies", "Male Contraception", "Medicine", "Organizations", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Technology", "Un", "Who"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "539532", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "05", "Day": "14"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0160-3450", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "19", "Issue": "10", "PubDate": {"Year": "1979", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "American pharmacy", "ISOAbbreviation": "Am Pharm"}, "ArticleTitle": "Fertility control sought from plants in worldwide effort.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "23", "EndPage": "24", "MedlinePgn": "23-4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Small", "ForeName": "W E", "Initials": "WE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "7801164", "ISSNLinking": "0160-3450"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["539532", "10.1016/s0160-3450(15)32272-8"]}}]}
