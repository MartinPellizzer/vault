The most famous species of Codonopsis are C. tangshen, C. lanceolate, and C. pilosula. The records showed that they have a long story usage as traditional Chinese medicines, as they were alleged to be able to intensify the spleen and the lung as well as enriching blood and engendering liquid. Certain species have a culinary value in southern China and Southeast Asia, where they are considered as tea, wine, soup, plaster, and porridge. Codonopsis species were shown to be of great importance in medicine, due to their broad biological activity. Therefore, a clear understanding of their genetic diversity is needed.\u00a0 Adequate distinctions and descriptions of those species are necessary to preserve plant reservoir, investigations of genes associated with desirable traits, and understanding of evolutionary relationships. Subsequently, various molecular marker techniques such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR), and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR), Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and Sequence-Characterized Amplified Region (SCAR) have been improved to provide\u00a0 detailed informations about genomes, that historically were\u00a0 not possible to obtain based on only phenotypic methods. This review represents the usage of DNA molecular markers for molecular diversity analysis of medically important species belonging to the genus Codonopsis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mingjun", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Abdalrahman", "ForeName": "Hosham", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Sonia", "ForeName": "Uwimbabazi", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Haematology & Immunohaematology, Faculty of Medical Laboratories Sciences, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Mohammed", "ForeName": "Alaa I", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Lanzhou Jiaotong, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Vestine", "ForeName": "Uwitugabiye", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Minggang", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, Jouybar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Jouybar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebadi", "ForeName": "Abdol Ghaffar", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fishery, Islamic Azad University Babol Branch, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Toughani", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32415950"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
