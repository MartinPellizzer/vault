To maintain stable body weight, subjects were kept on an isocaloric diet (20% protein, 48% carbohydrate (CH), 32% fat, P/S = 2) for 1 month and then hospitalized for two consecutive 18-day periods while receiving an isocaloric diet of different composition (15% protein, 50% CH, 26% fat, P/S = 2). Women were provided 50 g and men 70 g daily of egg-white or fava bean protein concentrate during the two crossover periods. Hematocrit and fasting plasma or serum were analyzed every 3 days for glucose, insulin, uric acid, creatinine, total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterols, and for total and VLDL triglyceride. Dietary adequacy of both proteins was evaluated by measuring plasma concentration of prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding globulin. Insulin and hematocrit did not show any change, nor did any other biochemical variables show significant differences when results were compared at the end of each crossover period. Compared with baseline, fasting plasma glucose significantly decreased on the fava bean diet. Serum total and LDL cholesterol decreased during both diets but were statistically significant only on the egg-white diet. Serum HDL cholesterol significantly decreased only on the fava bean diet. Serum total and VLDL triglyceride did not show any significant change. Labile plasma protein concentration was significantly reduced only on the fava bean diet. In conclusion, the fava bean diet did not show a significant effect on lowering serum total and LDL cholesterol. Such an effect was mild but significant on the egg-white diet, compared with baseline."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Contaldo", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Di Biase", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Giacco", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pacioni", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moro", "ForeName": "C O", "Initials": "CO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grasso", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mancini", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fidanza", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Prev Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0322116", "ISSNLinking": "0091-7435"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "very low density lipoprotein triglyceride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egg White"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, HDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6844293", "10.1016/0091-7435(83)90183-4", "0091-7435(83)90183-4"]}}]}
