For the first time, a surrounding of macromolecular crowding was established to promote the formation of the complex of the template with functional monomer efficiently thus highly pure template molecule was unnecessary. In this study, the MIP monolith was synthesized using low purity lactucopicrin as template in place of highly pure one, and polystyrene was used as macromolecular crowding agent. 4-Vinylpyridine and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate were used as functional monomer and crosslinker, respectively. Polymerization parameters, including the ratio of functional monomer/template, various template concentrations, and PS concentration on the affinity of the resulting MIP were systematically investigated. For the lactucopicrin MIP made with the purity of lactucopicrin of 92%, the imprinting factor can be up to 2.2. The resulting MIP was filled in solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge to purify lactucopicrin from the crude extract of Cichorium glandulosum Boiss. et Huet. After two cycles of MIP SPE for the crude extract, the highest recovery and purity of lactucopicrin was 64.8% and 97.8%, respectively. The results indicated that the use of macromolecular crowding agent is an effective method for improving the performance of the MIP prepared with the template of low purity, particularly valuable to the cases in which the highly pure target molecule is hard to be obtained."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
