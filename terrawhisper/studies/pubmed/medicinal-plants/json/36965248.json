Based on the preprocessing of Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-MIR) by 1st, 2nd, SNV, 2nd\u00a0+\u00a0MSC and 2nd\u00a0+\u00a0SG, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and CatBoost models were established. To avoid complex preprocessing and feature extraction, we try deep learning modeling methods based on image processing. In this paper, the concept of three-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (3DCOS) projection image was proposed, and 9 datasets of synchronous, asynchronous and integrative images are generated by computer method. In addition, 18 deep learning models were established for 9 image datasets with different sizes. The results showed that the accuracy of the three types of synchronous spectral models reached 100%, while the accuracy of the asynchronous spectral and integrative spectral models of 3DCOS projection images were 96.97% and 97.98% in the case of big datasets, which overcame the defects of poor modeling effect of asynchronous spectral and integrative spectral in previous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) studies. In conclusion, the modeling results of 3DCOS projection images are perfect, and we can apply this method to other identification fields in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
