{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["In Brazil, alternative religious approaches are being used to spread the message of AIDs prevention. The concepts and practices of traditional Afro--Brazilian religion are being used in a newly released booklet for religious leaders of Candomble, a traditional spirit cult that traces its origins to the Yoruba of western Africa. There is a fusion of this spirit cult with Catholicism. The practice of all night dancing ceremonies where initiates appeal to orixas for guidance is coupled with private daily obligations. Orixas offer to cure the spirit and the body and are often used after Western medicine has failed to provide a cure. Candomble and Umbanda are the most widely observed religions in Brazil. There is a saying that everyone in Brazil is Catholic, but believers in Afro-Brazilian religion. Catholic parishes account for 19,000 places of worship throughout the country, but in 3 of the largest states, excluding the most \"African\" state Bahia, there are 55,000 Afro--Brazilian religious centers. 30,000 are in Rio de Janeiro, 16,00 in Sao Paulo, and 11,700 in Rio Grande do Sul. Although these religious centers are part of Brazilian identity and culture, government officials and the Catholic Church have repressed or looked unfavorably upon them. The group, Religious Support Against AIDS (ARCA), sponsored by the Institute for Religious Studies, provides education and consciousness raising through religious and social activities. ARCA hosted a meeting with Candomble religious leaders in May 1989 to explore options for dealing with AIDs, since their contact was with the poorer segments of the population and they possessed knowledge of traditional cures and medicinal plants. The meeting was successful, and ARCA was asked to provide educational materials. The problem was that ceremonial, rites were private and an AIDs stigma might emerge among the priests and priestesses, who were thought to be mainly homosexuals. With the expertise of anthropologist and a historian/religious leader well known tales were adapted to relay more information on health and AIDs in particular. 3 stories were presented in comic strip form and designed by a professional. The manual was titled ODO YA] and finished in August 1991. 50,000 copies will be distributed to religious leaders and 20,000 pamphlets to followers. Success is uncertain, but the project is exciting and hopeful in utilizing a rich symbolic tradition and informal groups far removed from the formal power structure and sacred traditions."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["069257", "00206748"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: DEVELOPMENT COMMUNICATION REPORT"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control", "Americas", "Brazil", "Catholicism", "Christianity", "Communication", "Communication Programs", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Hiv Infections--prevention and control", "Iec", "Influentials", "Knowledge Sources", "Latin America", "Mass Media", "Organization And Administration", "Pamphlets", "Printed Media", "Program Activities", "Programs", "Progress Report", "Religion", "South America", "Viral Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12284523", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1992", "Month": "04", "Day": "01"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0192-1312", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "74", "PubDate": {"Year": "1991"}}, "Title": "Development communication report", "ISOAbbreviation": "Dev Commun Rep"}, "ArticleTitle": "Sacred messages for AIDS prevention.
