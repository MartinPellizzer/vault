Traditional herbal therapy has been widely used in some developing countries as a complementary and alternative technique. Because of their low toxicity, medicinal edible plants have been allowed to minimize the risk of breast cancer and other diseases. The heart of Phoenix dactylifera is a well-known, safe, and common edible part of the P. dactylifera plant (Hilawi variety). The biological properties of heart of P. dactylifera are unclear, and the appeal warrants further investigation. The aim of this study is to look into the chemical compositions, antioxidant and anticancer properties of heart of P. dactylifera extract obtained via microwave-assisted extraction.", "Microwave-assisted extraction, ethanol solvent, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis, DPPH assay, MTT assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis were all used to evaluate the activity of heart of P. dactylifera.", "GC-MS was used to identify the chemical compositions of heart of P. dactylifera extract, which revealed about 15 bioactive compounds. The antioxidant activity of heart of P. dactylifera extract was determined to have an IC50 value of 114.2 \u00b5g/ml. The cytotoxicity was measured using MCF-7 cells, and the IC50 was reported to be 620.1 \u00b5g/ml. The cell cycle was arrested at the G1 gate, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis.", "The findings suggested that regular consumption of P. dactylifera heart components is important for nutrition and immune system support in the prevention of breast cancer, and that more research into molecular apoptotic pathways is needed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6915-3369"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ministry of Education, General Directorate of Education in Basrah, Basrah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Hameed", "ForeName": "Mustafa F", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Education for Pure Sciences, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Mkashaf", "ForeName": "Ihsan A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0690-4612"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Education for Pure Sciences, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Al-Shawi", "ForeName": "Ali A A", "Initials": "AAA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9796-0929"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Education for Pure Sciences, University of Basrah, Basrah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Hussein", "ForeName": "Kawkab A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "101130625", "ISSNLinking": "1513-7368"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phoeniceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abu-Darwish MS, Efferth T.
