Here for the first time, we have synthesized quaker ladies flower type ZnO (ZnO/QNF) from panos extract (extract from four panax plants such as Panax ginseng, Acanthopanax senticosus, Kalopanax septemlobus and Dendropanax morbifera). The synthesized ZnO materials was characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Transmission electron microscope. The newly synthesized ZnO/QNF was applied for the removal of industrial dyes such as methylene blue (MB), Eosin Y (EY) and Malachite green (MG) under UV illumination. The photocatalyst degraded the 15\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> MB, EY and MG to >99% within 80, 90 and 110\u202fmin of contact time, respectively. In addition, the ZnO/QNF photocatalyst removed the low concentrated 5\u202fmg\u202fL<sup>-1</sup> of MB, EY, and MG within 30, 35 and 40\u202fmin of contact time, respectively. The pedal structure provided all the active sites available for the easy interaction with dye molecule under UV, and that enabled fast kinetics of dye degradation than the many other benchmark materials reported previously. The ZnO photocatalyst could be reused minimum of five cycles without any significant loss in degradation efficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
