Swiss albino mice (6-8 weeks of age) were fed orally with 80, 160 and 320\u2009mg/kg bw of BDE within a span of 180 d. After the treatment, body weight, absolute- and relative-testis weight, relative-weight of other organs, their biochemical parameters, hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) of spermatozoa, testis histology and fertility and fecundity tests were performed to justify the toxic effects of D. esculentum on male reproductive functions.", "Significant dose- and time-dependent decreases were observed in body weight, absolute- and relative-testis weight, relative-weights of other organs and their biochemical parameters, percentage of live spermatozoa and percentage of fertility and fecundity in BDE fed mice. Significant decreases were observed in diameter, perimeter and area of the seminiferous tubules of mice treated for 180 d. The percentage of empty seminiferous tubules was increased significantly in BDE treated mice when compared to the controls.", "These results suggest that the intake of D. esculentum, even after cooking, may induce infertility by altering the male reproductive function, and therefore, should be evaluated further as a potential antifertility agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular Immunology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of North Bengal , Siliguri, West Bengal , India and."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Immunopharmacology and Molecular Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of Gour Banga , Malda, West Bengal , India."}], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "Subhrajyoti", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Cellular Immunology Laboratory, Department of Zoology, University of North Bengal , Siliguri, West Bengal , India and."}], "LastName": "Chaudhuri", "ForeName": "Tapas Kumar", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Ferns"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Seminiferous Tubules"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Loss"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27308970", "10.1080/01480545.2016.1190739"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
