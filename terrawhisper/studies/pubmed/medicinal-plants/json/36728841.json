Essential oils (EOs) are a mixture of volatile oils produced as a secondary metabolite in medicinal plants, and show activities against pests, insects, and pathogenic fungi. Their chemical composition is affected by several factors such as plant species or cultivar, geographical origin, environmental conditions, agricultural practices, and extraction method. The growing number of studies related to the herbicidal, insecticidal, acaricidal, nematicidal, and antimicrobial effects of EOs demonstrate their effectiveness and suitability as sustainable and environment-friendly biopesticides. EOs can biodegrade into nontoxic compounds; at the same time, their harmful and detrimental effects on non-target organisms are low. However, few biopesticide formulations based on EOs have been turned into commercial practice upto day. Several challenges including the reduced stability and efficiency of EOs under environmental conditions need to be addressed before EOs are widely applied as commercial biopesticides. This work is an overview of the current research on the application of EOs as biopesticides. Findings of recent studies focusing on the challenges related to the use of EOs as biopesticides are also discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Industry Research Co, Gorgan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Bio-Nanotech International Research Center (Fabiano), Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Assadpour", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department Food Engineering, Faculty of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Can Kara\u00e7a", "ForeName": "Asl\u0131", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Materials and Process Design Engineering, Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fasamanesh", "ForeName": "Mahdis", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Industry Research Co, Gorgan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Bio-Nanotech International Research Center (Fabiano), Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Sahar Akhavan", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Materials and Process Design Engineering, Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shariat-Alavi", "ForeName": "Mahya", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Horticulture and Plant Protection, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of California, Riverside, California, USA."}], "LastName": "Kharazmi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Saeed", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Abdur", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6877-9549"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Materials and Process Design Engineering, Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition and Bromatology Group, Department of Analytical Chemistry and Food Science, Faculty of Science, Universidade de Vigo, Ourense, Spain."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, China."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Seid Mahdi", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Control Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acaricides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Control Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acaricides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36728841", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2170317"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
