The sera of 29 children (mean age: 8.4 years) with a current or past history of allergic reactions after ingestion of chick pea, and positive skin tests to this legume, were used to study the allergenic composition of raw and boiled chick pea extracts. The patient population was divided into 2 groups: group 1 consisted of 19 patients with clinical sensitivity confirmed by either positive oral challenges or a convincing recent history of anaphylaxis after eating chick peas, and group 2 consisted of 10 patients with clinical sensitivity in the past, but tolerant at the time of blood extraction. Six atopic children, not allergic to legumes, were included as controls. Specific IgE to the raw and boiled extracts was measured by ELISA. The allergenic composition of both extracts was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots. There were no significant differences between specific IgE levels to the raw and boiled extracts (p = 0.23). The mean levels in group 1 were significantly higher than in group 2 and controls (p = 0.0001). Multiple IgE binding proteins/peptides were detected in both extracts in the molecular weight range of 10-106 kD. Only nontolerant patients recognized a similar number of bands in both extracts. Chick pea extracts contain a majority of heat-stable allergens, which could be responsible for the clinical sensitivity to chick pea. Patients with a current clinical allergy to chick pea have statistically higher specific IgE levels than tolerant patients and controls."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 S.
