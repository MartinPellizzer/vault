Their chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive and comprehensive spectroscopic methods, while the known alkaloids were identified by the comparison of their observed spectroscopic data including NMR data, MS data and optical rotation values with the data described in the literature. Furthermore, the antiproliferative activities as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of all isolated alkaloids in vitro were evaluated. All obtained alkaloids 1-12 displayed notable antiproliferative activities against diverse human cancer cell lines exhibiting IC<sub>50</sub> values in range of 0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 to 29.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0\u00b5M, which is equivalent to the positive control (cisplatin) showing IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 to 28.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.21\u00a0\u00b5M. Moreover, compounds 1-12 exhibited pronounced inhibitory activities on nitric oxide (NO) production with IC<sub>50</sub> values displaying IC<sub>50</sub> values in range of 0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 to 9.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15\u00a0\u00b5M, which is comparable to the positive control (hydrocortisone) holding an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u00b5M. These findings indicate that the separation and characterization of these alkaloids displaying significant antiproliferative activities together with anti-inflammatory effects from the roots of Z. austrosinense could be meaningful to the research and development of new anti-cancer drugs as well as anti-inflammatory agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
