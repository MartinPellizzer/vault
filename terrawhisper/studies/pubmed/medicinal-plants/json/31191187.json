Modern prescriptions such as pioglitazone have better therapeutic potential, but its side effects and financial burden for developing countries have motivated the researchers to find alternative natural drugs to compete hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes. The present study was conducted to explore the therapeutic potential of selected medicinal plants for the treatment of diabetes as an alternative to allopathic medicines.", "In present study, hydroalcoholic extracts of <i>Curcuma longa</i>, <i>Lavandula stoechas</i>, <i>Aegle marmelos,</i> and <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> and their polyherbal preparation (PHP) as compound drug were investigated for their antihyperglycemic potential in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The study subjects (mice) were divided into different groups as normal control, diabetic control, pioglitazone treated (standard drug), test groups (plant extract treated 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg body weight), and PHP-treated group. Blood glucose concentration of all the study animals was determined by Glucose strip test. Qualitative phytochemical analysis of all the plant extracts was also performed following standard methods.", "It was investigated that treatment of alloxan-induced diabetic mice with hydroalcoholic extracts of studied medicinal plants showed significant (<i>P</i> < .05) effects on fasting blood glucose levels (from baseline to normal range) in a manner comparable to that of the reference drug, pioglitazone (1 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal). The tested plant extracts significantly (<i>P</i> < .05) reduced the glucose concentration in blood of diabetes-induced mice in a dose-dependent manner.", "It could be concluded that studied medicinal plants have antihyperglycemic activity. The study findings favor the use of traditional herbal medicinal practices for the management of diabetes that might due to the presence of bioactive phytoconstituents in plants. However, larger studies are required to identify, isolate, and characterize the bioactive phytoconstituents responsible for antihyperglycemic activity of studied medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mustafa", "ForeName": "Sodah Bint", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, Directorate of Medical Sciences, Government College University Faisalabad-Pakistan, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Akram", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine, College of Conventional Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy and Alternative Medicine, Government College University Faisalabad-Pakistan, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Muhammad Asif", "ForeName": "Hafiz", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qayyum", "ForeName": "Imran", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hashmi", "ForeName": "Asif Mehmood", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Government College University Faisalabad, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Munir", "ForeName": "Naveed", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Eastern Medicine and Surgery, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, The University of Poonch, Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Fahad Said", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Allied Health Sciences, Sargodha Medical College, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Riaz", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9291-7059"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Agriculture, University of Sargodha, Sargodha, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Dose Response", "NlmUniqueID": "101308899", "ISSNLinking": "1559-3258"}, "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kumar P, Clark M.
