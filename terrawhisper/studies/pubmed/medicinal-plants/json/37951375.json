Plants have actively been used for healthcare practices globally since the time immemorial. Medicinal uses of plants have been well recognized in India, evident from plant species documented in different traditional medicinal systems such as Ayurveda (1400-1800 species), Siddha (500-900 species), Unani (400-700 species), Homeopathy (about 372 species), and Sowa-Rigpa (about 250 species), etc. AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary purpose of this review is to provide systematic updated information on thirteen medicinal plants prioritized by the Indian government (providing75 % subsidy on cultivation cost) based on the availability and market demand of these plants. Updated information regarding the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control, and conservation status of these plants will help in understanding their pharmacological and commercial importance. This will also help in developing new strategies for their conservation.", "Online databases such as SciFinder, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Google Scholar were used to collect the electronically available literature on targeted thirteen plants. Also, different Indian government official websites such as AYUSH (https://www.ayush.gov.in); NMPB (National Medicinal Plants Board) (https://nmpb.nic.in); e.charak (https://echarak.in) were used for collecting information related to the amount of subsidy, trade and price related information of these plants.", "To promote medicinal plant cultivation, the Indian government provides subsidies for cultivating some traditionally important medicinal plants. These plants are divided into three categories according to the subsidy provided to farmers, i.e., 30%, 50%, and 75% of the cost of cultivation. Thirteen medicinal plants which are provided 75% subsidy are Aconitum ferox Wall., Aconitum heterophyllum Wall., Aquilaria agallocha Roxb., Berberis aristata DC., Commiphora wightii (Arn.) Bhandari, Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC., Oroxylum indicum (L.) Benth. ex Kurz, Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex Benth., Podophyllum hexandrum Royle, Pterocarpus santalinus L.f., Santalum Album L., Saussurea costus (Falc.) Lipsch., and Swertia chirayita (Roxb.) H.Karst. The literature survey reveals the enormous traditional medicinal importance, wide geographical distribution, diverse range of natural products, and broad spectrum of pharmacological activities of these plants.", "A comprehensive literature survey revealed that although remarkable progress has been made in isolation, bioactivity evaluation, quality assessment, and conservation, there is still a lot of scope for further scientific interventions. Scientific validation of traditionally claimed medicinal potential is lacking for various bioactivities. Some of the bioactivities are performed just on extracts/fractions, so there is a need for proper phytochemical studies to identify active constituents responsible for the specific bioactivity. Further, quality assessment methods using both targeted and non-targeted tools are required to evaluate the quality of these highly-priced medicinal plants and their adulterants. Ultimately, to encourage the cultivation of these endangered medicinal plant species, it is imperative to implement proper legislation and employ in-situ and ex-situ conservation tools."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
