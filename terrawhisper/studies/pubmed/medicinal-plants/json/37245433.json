The domino reaction pathway involves cyclocondensation/N-alkylation sequence in K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>/N,N-dimethyl formamide under heating condition. DPPH free radical scavenging activity of all synthesized pyrazolo[5\u2033,1'':2',3']pyrimido[4',5':5,6][1,4]thiazino[2,3-b]quinoxalines was evaluated to determine their antioxidant potentials. IC<sub>50</sub> values were recorded in the range of 29-71\u00a0\u03bcM. N-benzyl substituted derivative represented the most effective antioxidant activity as well as antiproliferative activity against MCF-7\u00a0cells. Moreover, fluorescence in solution for these compounds exhibited strong red emission in the visible region (\u03bb<sub>flu.</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0536-558\u00a0nm) with good to excellent quantum yields (61-95%). Due to their interesting fluorescence properties, these novel pentacyclic fluorophores can be used as fluorescent markers and probes for studies in biochemistry and pharmacology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
