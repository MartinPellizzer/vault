The Sephadex gel filtration profile showed the presence of two forms of the enzyme, alpha-galactosidase I with an apparent Mr = 160,000 and alpha-galactosidase II of Mr = 40,000. Enzyme II readily aggregates to form I when any attempt is made to concentrate the solution. Thus, only enzyme I was purified and its properties studied. The multistep purification procedure included affinity binding of the enzyme to concanavalin A-Sepharose, indicating its glycoprotein nature with glucose/mannose termini of the carbohydrate moieties. The amino acid and carbohydrate compositions of the native enzyme and that of the glycopeptide obtained from pronase-digested, denatured enzyme have been determined. Asparagine seems to be involved in forming the linkage with the carbohydrate moiety. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of enzyme I shows a single protein band with Mr = 40,000 which also stains with periodic acid-Schiff reagent. Thus, the enzyme consists of four identical glycoprotein subunits. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is 8.0. The pH optima of enzyme I and II are 6.1 and 4.7, respectively. The substrate specificity and the mode of substrate inhibition of enzyme I is discussed. The effect of temperature on Vmax and Km of the enzyme is presented; at pH 6.1 the energy of activation is 62.1 kJ/mol and the delta H value is -34.3 kJ/mol in the temperature range 20-50 degrees C. Preliminary studies show that enzyme I possesses hemagglutinating properties with glucose/mannose specificity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dey", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Del Campillo", "ForeName": "E M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lezica", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.22", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Galactosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mathematics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Galactosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6296089", "S0021-9258(18)33139-9"]}}]}
