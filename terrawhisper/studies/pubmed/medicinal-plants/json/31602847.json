The factors of their growth environment affects the quality of Dao-di herbs. Choosing the right place to produce,rationally planting appropriate local medicinal materials,and improving the quality and yield of authentic medicinal materials are prerequisites for ensuring the steady development of Chinese medicine industry. In this paper,a knowledge model of the relationship between organic medicinal materials and growth environment factors was constructed by integrating the dataset of environmental factors of medicinal materials,and a knowledge base was constructed to provide a decision for the study of suitable medicinal materials under different environmental conditions. Based on this,it is expected to provide a platform for further research on the relationship between the medicinal properties of medicinal herbs and environmental factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Engineering Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Meng", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Engineering Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Xu-Can", "Initials": "XC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Engineering Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xian-Bao", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Information Engineering Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine,Beijing University of Chinese Medicine Beijing 102488,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602847", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190504.104"]}}]}
