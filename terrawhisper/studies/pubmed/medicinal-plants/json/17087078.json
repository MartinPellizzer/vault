The prescription and technique of core tablets were formulated with selecting disintegrating time and swelling volume of core tablets in water as index. The time-controlled release tablets were prepared by adopting press-coated techniques, using PEG6000, HCO and EVA as coating materials. The influences of compositions, preparation process and dissolution conditions in vitro on the lag time (T(lag)) of drug release were investigated.", "The composition of core tablets was as follow: 30% of drug, 50% MCC and 20% CMS-Na. The T(lag) of time-controlled release tablets was altered remarkably by PEG6000 content of the outer layer, the amount of outer layer and hardness of tablet. The viscosity of dissolution media and basket rotation had less influence on the T(lag) but more on rate of drug release.", "The core tablets pressed with the optimized composition had preferable swelling and disintegrating properties. The shuxiong sustained-release formulations which contained core tablet and two kinds of time-controlled release tablets with 3 h and 6 h of T(lag) could release drug successively at 0 h, 3 h and 6 h in vitro. The technique made it possible that various components with extremely different physicochemical properties in these preparations could release synchronously."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Fuzhou General Hospital of Nanjing Military Region, Fuzhou 350025, China. sohoto@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Hong-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Da-Wei", "Initials": "DW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhong-Gui", "Initials": "ZG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tablets"}, {"RegistryNumber": "25249-54-1", "NameOfSubstance": "polyvinylpolypyrrolidone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61791-12-6", "NameOfSubstance": "polyethoxylated castor oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-79-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Castor Oil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FZ989GH94E", "NameOfSubstance": "Povidone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Carthamus tinctorius"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Castor Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hardness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ligusticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Povidone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tablets"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17087078"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
