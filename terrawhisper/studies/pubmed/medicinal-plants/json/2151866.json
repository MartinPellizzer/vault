Changes in heart rates and the incidence of arrhythmias were evaluated using ambulatory electrocardiography. Denopamine 30 and 60 mg (beta 1 agonist), xamoterol 200 and 400 mg (beta 1 partial agonist) and OPC-8212 60, 90 and 120 mg (non-catecholamine) were sequentially administered for 10 +/- 2 months. Denopamine slightly increased heart rate throughout the day. Denopamine 60 mg caused excessive tachycardia in patients with atrial fibrillation, and could be used without digoxin. With xamoterol, maximum heart rate decreased during the daytime, while heart rate increased at night. Xamoterol was highly effective in patients with atrial fibrillation who not only had excessive tachycardia during exercise but marked bradycardia at night. Xamoterol increased the severity of heart failure in two patients who belonged to NYHA class IV, whose heart rates at rest had exceeded 100 beats/min. OPC-8212 did not affect heart rate, and was considered an ideal inotropic agent. None of these agents aggravated arrhythmias or caused sustained ventricular tachycardia. It was concluded that not only the severity of heart failure but the chronotropic and arrhythmogenic effects should be considered when choosing inotropic agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo."}], "LastName": "Fukuda", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Handa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ogawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nakamura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawamura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Cardiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8804703", "ISSNLinking": "0914-5087"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanolamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propanolamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5COW40EV8M", "NameOfSubstance": "vesnarinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7HE0JQL703", "NameOfSubstance": "Xamoterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V5F60UPD8P", "NameOfSubstance": "denopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Fibrillation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiomyopathy, Dilated"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circadian Rhythm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography, Ambulatory"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanolamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Propanolamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pyrazines"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xamoterol"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2151866"]}}]}
