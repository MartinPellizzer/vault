The diverse secondary metabolites play an important role in the prevention and cure of various diseases including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. Naturally occurring compounds such as flavonoids, polyphenols, alkaloids, and glycosides found in various parts of the plant and/or marine sources may potentially protect neurodegeneration as well as improve memory and cognitive function. Many natural compounds show anti-Alzheimer activity through specific pharmacological mechanisms like targeting \u03b2-amyloid, Beta-secretase 1 and Acetylcholinesterase. In this review, we have compiled more than 130 natural products with a broad diversity in the class of compounds, which were isolated from different sources showing anti- Alzheimer properties."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Physics, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912, United States."}], "LastName": "Panda", "ForeName": "Siva S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry & Physics, Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia 30912, United States."}], "LastName": "Jhanji", "ForeName": "Nancy", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amyloid beta-Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31215372", "10.2174/0929867326666190618113613", "CMC-EPUB-98945"]}}]}
