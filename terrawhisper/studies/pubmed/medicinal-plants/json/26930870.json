To find an alternative agent of overcoming the problems of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the antibacterial mechanism of Ponciruss trifoliata against MRSA was investigated. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-soluble extract of P. trifoliata methanolic extract was evaluated for antibacterial activity using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). An EtOAc sub-fraction 08 (EA08) from silica-gel open column chromatography exhibited strong anti-MRSA activity. Apart from the study to isolate single compound from EA08, a synergistic antibacterial effect between the sub-fraction and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics against MRSA was determined. In order to elucidate the antibacterial restoring mechanism of EA08 on MRSA, mRNA expression of mecA gene and production penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) encoded by mecA gene were monitored. EA 08 showed the strongest antibacterial activity with MIC value of 256 \u03bcg ml(-1). MIC of oxacillin against MRSA was dramatically reduced from 512 to 16 \u03bcg ml(-1) in combination with 256 \u03bcg ml(-1) of EA08. The fractional inhibitory concentration index of oxacillin was measured at 0.53 in combination with EA08 against MRSA, suggesting that EA08-oxacillin combinations exert synergetic effect against MRSA. The analysis of RT-PCR and Western blotting profiles revealed that EA08 inhibited mRNA expression of mecA gene and production PBP2a, which is a key determinant for \u03b2-lactam antibiotic resistance, in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicated that EA08 eventually led to the reduction or inhibition of PBP2a production through translational inhibition in MRSA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Eom", "ForeName": "Sung-Hwan", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "Yeoun-Joong", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Dae-Sung", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yim", "ForeName": "Mi-Jin", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hye Seon", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Sang-Hoon", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Myeong", "ForeName": "Jeong-In", "Initials": "JI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jinhwan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun-Woo", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Kyoung-Ho", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Myung-Suk", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Young-Mog", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8300544", "ISSNLinking": "0254-8704"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poncirus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26930870"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
