While the aqueous extract from Korean mistletoe (<8 microg/ml) showed strong cytotoxicity on both cell lines, the heat-treated extract was much less cytotoxic with TD50 values of above 300 microg/ml. The heat-treated extract showed a growth-enhancing effect on non-tumorigenic cells and a cytotoxic effect on tumorigenic cells. The alkaloids fraction, which was isolated from the crude extract, was not cytotoxic to non-tumorigenic A31 cells up to 550 microg/ml, but was cytotoxic to tumorigenic MSV cells at 138 microg/ml. Heat treatment did not change the cytotoxic effects of the alkaloids fraction, indicating that the selective cytotoxicity of the heat-treated mistletoe extract on tumorigenic MSV cells might be due to its alkaloids. In order to study the changes in the cytotoxicity of fermented Korean mistletoe, the crude and heat-treated extracts were inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum. During 7 days of fermentation, the cytotoxicity of the fermented heat-treated extract was increased while that of the fermented crude extract was not changed significantly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Foods and Safety, Handong University, Pohang, Kyungbuk, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hyun", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9563647", "10.1016/s0304-3835(97)00526-0", "S0304-3835(97)00526-0"]}}]}
