Several chemical compounds are extracted and identified from the different parts of the Vn such as leaves, root, seeds and flowers. Number of researches reported the herb as antimicrobial, anti-androgenic, anti-osteoporotic, and anti-tumour, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-hyperglycemic and hepatoprotective. The effects of Vn on neurite outgrowth have not been identified till now. Therefore present study was designed to investigate the neurite outgrowth effects of Vn extract in hippocampal neurons. Neurons from P0 mice were isolated and cultured in defined medium containing the different concentrations of Vn (20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150 and 200 \u03bcg/ml) for 48 hrs. The presence of the neurites was confirmed by using \u03b2III-tubulin antibody which specifically labels only the neurites. Morphometric analysis was done by using Optika Pro-Vision software. The data show that Vn at 30 and 40 \u03bcg/ml significantly increased the mean average length of the longest neurite whereas at 150 and 200 \u03bcg/ml it significantly decreased the mean average length of the 10 longest neurite in hippocampal neurons. Nevertheless Vn did not show any significant effects on the sum of all the neurite lengths at any concentrations tested. Taken together the result shows that methanolic extract of Vn has potential to produce long neurites at 30 and 40 \u03bcg/ml and therefore can be act as a neuroprotective agent in the future drug development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Sonia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saify", "ForeName": "Zafar Saeed", "Initials": "ZS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jamali", "ForeName": "Khawar Saeed", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tufail", "ForeName": "Priya", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kanwal", "ForeName": "Aiman", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Kamal", "ForeName": "Aisha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS), University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Faisal", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neurites"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vitex"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29386163"]}}]}
