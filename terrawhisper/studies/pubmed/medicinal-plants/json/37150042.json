Owing to undesirable side effects of current analgesic medications, there is an exceeding need to develop the effective alternative therapeutics. Nowadays, the application of nanomaterials is being highly considered, as their exceptional properties arising from the nanoscale dimensions are undeniable. With the increasing use of metal NPs, more biocompatible and costly methods of synthesis have been developed in which different biological rescores including microorganisms, plants and algae are employed. Nanobiotechnology-based synthesis of nanosized particles is an ecological approach offering safe production of nanoparticles (NPs) by biological resources eliminating the toxicity attributed to the conventional routes. This review provides an assessment of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as antinociceptive agents in recent studies. Living animal models (mice and rats) have been used for analyzing the effect of biogenic NPs on decreasing the nociceptive pain utilizing different methods such as acetic acid-induced writhing test, hot plate test, and formalin test. Potent analgesic activity exhibited by green fabricated AgNPs and AuNPs represents the bright future of nanotechnology in the management of pain and other social and medicinal issues followed by this unpleasant sensation. Moreover, there NPs showed a protective effects on liver, kidney, and body weight in animal models that make them attractive for clinical studies. However, further research is required to fully address the harmless antinociceptive effect of NPs for clinical usage."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
