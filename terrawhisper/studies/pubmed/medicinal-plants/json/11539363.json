Prior to gravistimulation, root tissue sections from the sides of the elongation zone responded similarly to IAA. After gravistimulation (within 5 min), root sections from the bottom of the elongation zone became more responsive to IAA than sections collected from the upper side of the elongation zone. The change in IAA responsiveness of these tissue sections was transient with root sections from both the top and bottom of the elongation zone again exhibiting similar responsiveness to IAA following 15 minutes of gravistimulation. These studies also examined if the root tip is required for the gravity-induced shift in IAA responsiveness in the tissues of the elongation zone. The IAA responsiveness of top and bottom sections of the elongation zone from decapped mung bean roots was assessed at varying times following gravistimulation. The responsiveness to IAA of top and bottom sections changed rapidly in decapped roots, just as had been previously found for intact roots. Although the alteration in responsiveness was transient in decapped roots (just as intact roots), the time it took for the sections to recover previous responsiveness to IAA was extended. The results suggest that the initial growth response of graviresponding roots may be due to a change in the IAA responsiveness of tissues in the elongation zone and not an asymmetric accumulation of IAA on the lower side of the elongation zone. The results also indicate that the gravity-induced shift in IAA responsiveness in the elongation zone occurs independently of the root cap, suggesting that the cells in the elongation region can perceive and respond to gravity independently of the root cap during the initial phases of the gravity response."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, Rhodes College, Memphis, TN, USA."}], "LastName": "Stinemetz", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Growth Regul", "NlmUniqueID": "9886958", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6U1S09C61L", "NameOfSubstance": "indoleacetic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11539363", "10.1007/BF00043314"]}}]}
