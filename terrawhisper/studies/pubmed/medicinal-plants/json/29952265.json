Due to the long time required for treatment, hepatotoxicity of drugs and also emergence of Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) and Extremely Drug Resistant (XDR) strains, TB is currently a major public health problem. Some medicinal plants possess remarkable activity against Mycobacterium. Among them, Lamiaceae family are of pharmaceutical interest because of their potential antimicrobial properties. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro activities of Satureja rechingeri, Satureja khuzestanica and Zataria multiflora against MDR M. tuberculosis and two Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM).", "The essential oils were prepared by the standard method. The confirmed strains were obtained from the microbial collection of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) of essential oils of plants against mycobacterial strains were determined using standard broth microdilution method.", "MDR M. tuberculosis was completely inhibited by Z. multiflora at 78\u00b5g/ml concentration. S. rechingeri and S. khuzestanica also showed same anti-mycobacterial activity against MDR M. tuberculosis with MICs of 156 \u00b5g/ml. The MICs of the essential oils against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. kansasii and M. fortuitum were in the range from 39 to 156 \u00b5g/ml.", "The studied medicinal plants showed notable effects against mycobacterial strains. Our results indicated that utilization of Lamiaceae family can be helpful for treatment of mycobacterial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Microbiology Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemian", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Division of Microbiology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yamchi", "ForeName": "Jalil Kardan", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zandi", "ForeName": "Hengameh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bacteriology and Virology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taji", "ForeName": "Asieh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Microbiology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yazdani", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional TB reference laboratory, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hamzehloo", "ForeName": "Gholamreza", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghanavati", "ForeName": "Roya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahdar", "ForeName": "Hossein A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feizabadi", "ForeName": "Mohammad M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Antiinfect Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101266084", "ISSNLinking": "1574-891X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antitubercular Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nontuberculous Mycobacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29952265", "10.2174/1574891X13666180626170155", "PRI-EPUB-91281"]}}]}
