Merr. (Jusanqi) is a traditional herbal product used for hemostasis and detumescence in Chinese folk medicine. However, its hepatic toxicity should not be ignored. In this study, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) and their corresponding N-oxides (PANOs) were extracted from the whole plant of G. segetum and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry (ITMS). Identification of eluted peaks as PANOs was indicated by virtue of their MS and MS(n) analysis, in addition to the [M+H](+) adduct ion, characteristically showed a significant (usually 100% abundance) dimer adduct [2M+H](+) that is not observed in the MS of the parent PAs. A total of 20 compounds were identified or tentatively characterized based on their mass spectra and possible biosynthetic pathways, of which three PAs and one PANO, namely seneciphylline, senecionine, seneciphylline and seneciphyllinine N-oxide, were unequivocally characterized, while other PAs and PANOs were tentatively assigned. Sixteen constituents were reported for the first time from G. segetum and tetrahydrosenecionine has not been previously reported as a natural product. Our results are the first comprehensive analysis of PAs and PANOs in G. segetum constituents and will be helpful for the quality control of the herb of G. segetum and its related preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Informatics Institute, Zhejiang University (Zijingang Campus), Hangzhou 310058, P.R.
