Increasing the concentration of salicin in a diet of fruits and cereals led to significant reductions of food intake in the short term (6 days). After prolonged (20 days) exposure to salicin, food intake (19 g kg(-0.75) day(-1)) was still reduced relative to controls (31 g kg(-0.75) day(-1)) but not reduced to the same extent as in the short-term experiments. Nonetheless, over these 20 days, common brushtail possums regulated their intake of salicin so as not to exceed a threshold limit of 1.9 +/- 0.1 g kg(-0.75) day(-1). Manipulative experiments sought to determine whether this threshold intake was in response to pre-ingestive factors (taste) or the post-ingestive consequences of ingesting salicin. Dietary salicin (0.17-5.0% DM) had no significant effect on nitrogen balance or urea metabolism and injection of a specific serotonin receptor antagonist, ondansetron, did not lead to increases in salicin intake as has been found for some other plant secondary metabolites. Similarly, administration of 1.3 g salicin by gavage had no significant effect on the subsequent intake of salicin compared to controls that were gavaged with water. We concluded that pre-ingestive factors were responsible for common brushtail possums limiting their intake of salicin-rich diets rather than any measurable post-ingestive consequence of feeding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology and Tropical Ecology, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pass", "ForeName": "G J", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Foley", "ForeName": "W J", "Initials": "WJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Comp Physiol B", "NlmUniqueID": "8413200", "ISSNLinking": "0174-1578"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Alcohols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4649620TBZ", "NameOfSubstance": "salicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4AF302ESOS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ondansetron"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Alcohols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enteral Nutrition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preferences"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ondansetron"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Opossums"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Serotonin, 5-HT3"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10841258", "10.1007/s003600050274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
