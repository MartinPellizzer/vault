These antibodies were used to antigenically compare the Lath-O with other two-chain lectins like Lath-S, lentil and Vicia cracca glc specific and with one-chain lectins like Con A, PHA, peanut and soybean. Sensitive ELISA tests showed that there was a distinct antigenic cross-reaction between the one-chain and two-chain lectins both by using antibodies against Lath-O whole molecules and its isolated beta-chains, while the anti-Lath-O alpha-chain antibodies barely reacted at all even with Lath-O alpha-chains. The antibodies against Lath-O whole molecules also strongly inhibited the mitogenic responses induced by two-chain lectins. Antibodies reacting inside the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectins were isolated by eluting them with glucose from lectin-Sepharose columns and antibodies reacting outside the carbohydrate-binding site were subsequently eluted with guanidine or buffer with low pH. The two antibody fractions were separately used to antigenically compare one-chain and two-chain lectins, demonstrating that both kinds of antibodies showed cross-reaction between one-chain and two-chain lectins. Both the antibodies presumably reacting inside the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectins and those reacting outside the carbohydrate-binding site inhibited haemagglutination activity of two-chain lectins, while haemagglutination by one-chain lectins was unaffected. The carbohydrate-binding site specificity of the glucose-eluted antibodies was assessed by glucose-inhibition in ELISA tests. Furthermore, galactose neither inhibited in these tests nor eluted antibodies from lectin-Sepharose columns. Control experiments were also performed with normal rabbit IgG."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michaelsen", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kolberg", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pathol Microbiol Immunol Scand C", "NlmUniqueID": "8206624", "ISSNLinking": "0108-0202"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peanut Agglutinin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "lentil lectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11028-71-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Concanavalin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Concanavalin A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunodiffusion"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peanut Agglutinin"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6424408", "10.1111/j.1699-0463.1984.tb00048.x"]}}]}
