Helicobacter pylori is known for causing inflammation and the onset of gastric ulcers. While several studies explored medicinal plants against H. pylori, investigation of medicinal plants used for gastric ulcers has been neglected, as well as the effects these plants would have on bacteria occurring naturally in the gut microbiome.", "This study aimed to investigate Southern African medicinal plants used traditionally for treating gastric ulcers against H. pylori , as well as the effects that these plants have when combined with Lactobacillus species and tested against H. pylori.", "Based on evidence from the ethnobotanical literature, 21 plants were collected. Their antimicrobial activity was assessed against five clinical H. pylori strains, and in combination with each of three Lactobacillus species, using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) broth microdilution assays. Toxicity was assessed using the brine shrimp lethality assay.", "Noteworthy activity was observed against at least one H. pylori strain for 12 plant species. The lowest mean MICs were from organic extracts of Carissa edulis Vahl (0.18\u00a0mg/mL) and Chironia baccifera L. (0.20\u00a0mg/mL), and aqueous extracts of Sansevieria hyacinthoides (L.) Druce (0.26\u00a0mg/mL) and Dodonaea viscosa Jacq. (0.30\u00a0mg/mL). Aqueous extracts of the investigated plants were combined with Lactobacillus species, and the majority of combinations showed increased antimicrobial activity compared with the extracts alone. Combinations of Lactobacillus rhamnosus with 18 of the 21 aqueous plant extracts showed at least a two-fold decrease in the mean MBC against all H. pylori strains tested. Lactobacillus acidophilus combined with either Protea repens L., Carpobrotus edulis (L.) L. Bolus or Warburgia salutaris (Bertol.f.) Chiov. aqueous extracts had the best anti-H. pylori activity (mean MBCs of 0.10\u00a0mg/mL for each combination). Only four organic and one aqueous extract(s) were considered toxic.", "These results highlight the potential of medicinal plants to inhibit H. pylori growth and their role in traditional treatments for the management of ulcers. The results also indicate that aqueous extracts of these plants do not hinder the growth of bacteria that occur naturally in the gut microbiome and play a role in maintaining gut health, as well as show the potential benefit of including Lactobacillus species as potentiators of H. pylori activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
