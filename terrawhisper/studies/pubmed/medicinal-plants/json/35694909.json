Pusa Bold in India.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Mustard (Brassica juncea L.) is an important oil seed crop in the Brassicaceae family. It is widely cultivated in India for its edible leaves, oil and medicinal properties. In January 2022, we noticed necrotic symptoms typical black rot disease on Brassica juncea (L.) cv. Pusa Bold grown in Indian Agricultural Research Institute, India. Initially, chlorotic lesions emerged on the leaf margin, which progressed to angular V-shaped necrotic lesions and blackened veins. Disease progression became a necrotic appearance in the leaf results browning and papery leaf texture appeared. The suspected causal agent was isolated from three different diseased plants of Pusa Bold on nutrient sucrose agar medium that formed pale yellow, mucoid, and fluidal colonies. Three representative isolates originated from three different plants were sub-cultured on YGCA medium. These isolates are Gram-negative, oxidase negative, KOH positive, nonfluorescent on King's Medium B agar, and positive for starch hydrolysis test (Schaad and White 1974). The 16S ribosomal RNA gene and avirulence genes - AvrBs1 and AvrGf1 were amplified and sequenced in these three isolates with other Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) isolates. The DNA sequence analysis revealed that these isolates are within the species of X. campestris. The race 1 specific marker namely xcc-b100_4389 was used to characterized the race by detection of 1090bp fragment respectively from gDNA of Xcc isolates (Rubel et al., 2017). The pathogenicity of these isolates was tested twice on youngest leaves of 30-day-old plants of Pusa Bold to convey Koch postulates. Inoculum of three isolates were prepared in nutrient broth at 28\u00b0C for 48-h. The pathogenicity test was conducted by small scissors dipped in a bacterial suspension (~ 108 cfu/ml) to cut leaf near margins at 10 points per leaf and the three youngest leaves per plant with three replications. The number of infected points per leaf and the severity of symptoms were assessed 15 and 30 days after inoculation (Singh et al., 2011; 2016). The chlorotic lesions with V-shaped symptoms were appeared on all inoculated plants after 15 and 30 dpi (days post-inoculation). The bacteria were reisolated from inoculated plants and has the same identity as original isolates by using 16S rRNA, avr genes and race 1 specific marker PCR, thereby confirming Koch's postulates. The bacterial inoculation was repeated and the same symptoms appear. Most of the crucifers are infected with black rot disease e.g., cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels, sprout etc. (Vicente et al., 2001). The nucleotide BLAST analysis of 16S rRNA, AvrBs1, AvrGf1 showed a 100% identity with different Xcc strains reported from Germany (B100; AM920689), Brazil (ATCC 33913; AE008922), India (Xcc-C7; CP077958), France (CFBP 5817; CM002673) and China (8004; CP000050) (Singh et al. 2022). Whilst, the nBLAST analysis of xcc-b100_4389 showed 100% nucleotide identity with Xcc race 1 (B100; AM920689), Germany. The sequences were deposited in GenBank (16S rRNA: OM839780; AvrBs1: OM994397; AvrGf1: OM994398; xcc-b100_4389: OM994399). The XccAK1 strain (ITCCBH_0014) was deposited in Indian Type Culture Collection, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, India. Presently, it is a first report of necrotic black rot on B. juncea cv. Pusa Bold incited by Xcc race 1, India. Previous research reported the black rot disease on other species of the Brassica genus e.g., B. oleracea, and B. napus in Serbia (Popovic et al., 2013) and Argentina (Gaetan et al., 2005)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute, 28802, Division of Plant Pathology, BACTERIOLOGY LAB NO. 27, DIVISION OF PLANT PATHOLOGY, IARI, PUSA, NEW DELHI, New Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, India, 110012."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity University, 77282, Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India, 201303; amit.kesharwani@student.amity.edu."}], "LastName": "Kesharwani", "ForeName": "Amit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Division of Plant Pathology, Division of Plant Pathology, IARI, Pusa, New Delhi- 110012, Delhi, Delhi, India, 110012."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural research Institute, Division of Plant Pathology, Division of Plant Pathology, IARI, Pusa, New Delhi- 110012, Delhi, Delhi, India, 110012; dinesh_iari@rediffmail.com."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Dinesh", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute, 28802, Division of Plant Pathology, New Delhi, Delhi, India; aditya.ihbt@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kulshreshtha", "ForeName": "Aditya", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "plant pathology, ICAR-NBAIM, MAU, mau, uttar pradesh, India, 275103; abhijeet4497@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kashyap", "ForeName": "Abhijeet Shankar", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity University, 77282, Amity institute of Biotechnology, Amity Institute Of Biotechnology, Amity University, Sector 125, Noida-201313, Noida, India, India, 201313; asavasthi@amity.edu."}], "LastName": "Avasthi", "ForeName": "Anupama Sharma", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute, 28802, Plant Pathology, Division of Plant Pathology, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, Delhi, India, 110012; nilugeat@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Geat", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35694909", "10.1094/PDIS-04-22-0738-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
