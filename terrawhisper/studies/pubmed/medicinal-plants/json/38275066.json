Limitations of conventional CRC therapies force scientists to develop novel treatment concepts for both primary care alongside adjuvant therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been introduced as a promising therapeutic procedure for CRC mediated through theranostic principle in which special dyes, photosensitizers (PSs), are excited by near-infrared (NIR) and visible light. Recent studies showed that PDT has synergistic effects in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy in the treatment of CRC patients. Of note, nanoformulation of PS or immunotherapeutic agents could augment the PDT effectiveness. In this review, we summarize PDT application in CRC management with a special focus on the nanoparticles-based delivery system from the perspective of targeting deeper CRC and increased PDT efficiency, which could provide a desirable approach for clinical translation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehrabadi", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hassanian", "ForeName": "Seyed Mahdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghayour-Mobarhan", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Brighton & Sussex Medical School, Division of Medical Education, Falmer, Brighton, Sussex, BN1 9PH, UK."}], "LastName": "Ferns", "ForeName": "Gordon A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khazaei", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic syndrome Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Medical Sciences Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Science, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Genetics Research center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Avan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38275066", "10.2174/0109298673267788231208073338", "CMC-EPUB-137798"]}}]}
