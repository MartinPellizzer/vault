Plants belonging to this genus are well recognized for their richness in bioactive constituents. The huge variety of secondary metabolites make their complete analysis impossible. In order to cope with this challenge, effect-directed analysis (EDA) via HPTLC coupled to structure elucidation techniques was applied on Primula species for the first time. As straightforward non-target bioanalytical technique, HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-EDA-ESI-HRMS hyphenates three different orthogonal dimensions, i.e. chromatography with spectrometric detection, biological/enzymatic assays and HRMS. The bioactive metabolites were determined in the middle polar extracts of two Primula species, P. veris (flower) and P. boveana (leaf). The bioactivity profiling comprised the antibacterial activity against Aliivibrio fischeri and Bacillus subtilis bacterial strains and acetyl-/butyrylcholinesterase (AChE/BChE) inhibition assays. The compounds were characterized and identified via their recorded spectral data (HRMS and <sup>1</sup>H NMR). The results showed that linoleic and linolenic acids were the principle bioactive compounds present in the studied P. veris flower extract. In the P. boveana leaf extract, flavone, 2'-methoxy-, 2'-hydroxy- and 5,6,2',6'-tetramethoxyflavone (zapotin) were determined as active metabolites. The identification of zapotin, which was previously undescribed in the investigated plant, was considered as the strength of the straightforward non-target bioanalytical technique. Flavone turned out to be the highest potent metabolite, and at the same time, a multipotent compound referring to its various bioactivities discovered. An equivalency calculation of the HPTLC-AChE inhibition by flavone was performed with reference to the well-known inhibitor rivastigmine. As a result, the amount of flavone contained in 10.0\u202f\u03bcg dry powder of P. boveana (corresponding to 0.1\u202f\u03bcL extract) inhibited as strong as 4.5\u202f\u03bcg rivastigmine. In other words, the flavone contained in P. boveana leaf extract powder turned out to be half as strong as the well-known AChE inhibitor rivastigmine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
