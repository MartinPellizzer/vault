Preliminary study revealed positive clinical effects of an innovative preparation from the two herbal extracts in the form of biodegradable chips as a subgingival adjunct to scaling and root planing. The purpose of this research was to evaluate further augmenting efficacy the combined herbal preparation may have among maintenance patients in comparison to standard supportive periodontal therapy (SPT), with additional monitoring of certain inflammatory markers.", "Fifteen patients in the recall programme who had completed conventional periodontal therapy with remaining probing pocket depths of 5-8 mm were enrolled. After baseline examination and collection of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples, SPT was provided and the target teeth in the test group received subgingival delivery of the medicated chips. The clinical parameters, which included probing pocket depth (PD), attachment level (AL), bleeding index (BI), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) were recorded and GCF samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months.", "The results showed significant improvement of PD, AL, and GI at 3 and 6 months and of BI at 6 months in the test group as compared to control. No significant differences in PI were found between the two treatment modalities at all subsequent visits. The test group also showed statistically greater reduction of IL-1beta at both 3 and 6 months and lower IL-6 concentration, which almost reached the level of significance at 6 months.", "The results indicate that adjunctive local delivery of extracts from C. asiatica in combination with P. granatum significantly improved clinical signs of chronic periodontitis and IL-1beta level in maintenance patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine and Periodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. sgrindwit@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sastravaha", "ForeName": "Grindwit", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gassmann", "ForeName": "Georg", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sangtherapitikul", "ForeName": "Preecha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grimm", "ForeName": "Wolf-Dieter", "Initials": "WD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Int Acad Periodontol", "NlmUniqueID": "100888553", "ISSNLinking": "1466-2094"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Centella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Scaling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lythraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Periodontitis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Statistics, Nonparametric"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16022023"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
