Moreover, the adaptations of phytochemicals produced by fine roots to abiotic and biotic pressures are less understood. Here, we explored the fine roots metabolomes of 315 tree species and their rhizosphere microbiome in southwestern China spanning tropical, subtropical, and subalpine forest ecosystems, to explore phytochemical diversity and endemism patterns of various metabolic pathways and phytochemical-microorganism interactions. We found that subalpine species showed higher phytochemical diversity but lower interspecific variation than tropical species, which favors coping with high abiotic pressures. Tropical species harbored higher interspecific phytochemical variation and phytochemical endemism, which favors greater species coexistence and adaptation to complex biotic pressures. Moreover, there was evidence of widespread chemical niche partitioning of closely related species in all regions, and phytochemicals showed a weak phylogenetic signal, but were regulated by abiotic and biotic pressures. Our findings support the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis, i.e., the intensity of phytochemical-microorganism interactions decreases from tropical to subalpine regions, which promotes greater microbial community turnover and phytochemical niche partitioning of host plants in the tropics than in higher latitude forests. Our study reveals the convergent phytochemical diversity patterns of various pathways and their interactions with microorganism, thus promoting species coexistence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
