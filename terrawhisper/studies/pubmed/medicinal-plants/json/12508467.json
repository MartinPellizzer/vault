While GM foods, foods derived from biotechnology, are popular with growers and producers, they are still a matter of some concern among consumers. In fact, our recent surveys showed that Japanese consumers had become uneasy about the potential health risks of genetically modified foods. Many Japanese consumers have only vague ideas about the actual health risks, and they appear to be making decisions simply by rejecting GM food because of non-informed doubts. Although the debate about GM foods has increased in the mass media and scientific journals, few articles concerning direct studies on the potential toxicity or adverse health effects of GM foods have appeared. The roles of relevant international regulatory bodies in ensuring that GM crops and food are safe are therefore have summarized. Finally, the current debate on use of GM crops in agriculture and future trends for development of GM foods with enriched nutrients, better functionality, and medicinal ingredients, which will be of direct benefit to the consumer, are covered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tokyo Metropolitan Ebara Hospital."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishiura", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Imai", "ForeName": "Hirohisa", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakao", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tsukino", "ForeName": "Hiromasa", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuroda", "ForeName": "Yoshiki", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Katoh", "ForeName": "Takahiko", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "19130150R", "ISSNLinking": "0546-1766"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Consumer Product Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forecasting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Opinion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "2", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12508467"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
