We can still find its distribution in the distribution areas recorded ten years ago, but the intensity of species group has greatly changed. Estimated according to the survey data obtained by quadrat reserves and distribution (i.e., reserves per unit area) or cultivation area, that the current wild reserves is less than 500,000 tons and the less than 150,000 tons for cultivated. The analysis results of glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin contents in 99 wild samples of collected underground part show that the average contents of glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin were respectively 34.8, 17.3 mg x g(-1), of which 61.6% samples can reach the standard (not less than 20, 10 mg x g(-1)) marked by \"Chinese Pharmacopoeia\" (2005 edition); The average glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin contents of cultivated samples were respectively 28.5, 15.3 mg x g(-1), which were much lower than the wild samples.", "We should enhance efforts in protecting the wild resources, strive to improve the quality of cultivated herbs, vigorously develop high-quality G. uralensis cultivation industries and promote farmers income to resolve the resource crisis, which is the reasonable way to achieve continuable use of G. uralensis resources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Pharmacy college, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100102, China. hmjtcm@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Mingjin", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenquan", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Shengli", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T0O79T74CD", "NameOfSubstance": "liquiritin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20617669", "10.4268/cjcmm20100802"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
