Through these manipulations it is possible to address any problem, provided it is associated with a gene determined character. In the case of legume crops, some features have been changed such as yield, plant morphology, susceptibility to pathogens and other stress factors which reduce grain quality and output. In Venezuela an example of genetic improvement is represented by the domestication of Canavalia ensiformis (L) DC. working out some problems which limited its use as a crop, such as the shape and growing pattern, to obtain erect plants, and pod length to avoid its contact with the humid soil which accelerates rotting. Regarding the improvement of grain quality, genotypes have been found with low canavanine content."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Gen\u00e9tica, F\u00e1cultad de Agronom\u00eda, UCV, Venezuela."}], "LastName": "Viera D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Mejoramiento gen\u00e9tico de leguminosas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9221716"]}}]}
