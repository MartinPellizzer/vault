The medicinal properties of these plants are due to the presence of pyrroquinazoline alkaloids. An UHPLC-ESI/MS/MS method in both positive and negative electrospray ionization in multiple-reaction-monitoring mode was developed and validated for the estimation of alkaloids and flavonoids in Adhatoda species and their marketed herbal formulations. Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC\u00ae BEH C<sub>18</sub> -column using a gradient elution with 0.1% formic acid in water and methanol. The developed method was validated as per International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and found to be accurate with overall recovery in the range 94.2-105.0% (RSD\u2009\u2264\u20091.71%), precise (RSD\u2009\u2264\u20093.44%) and linear (R<sup>2</sup> \u2009\u2265\u20090.9992) over the concentration range of 0.5-1000\u2009ng/mL. The total content of alkaloids and flavonoids were highest in the chloroform and aqueous fraction of A. vasica leaf, respectively. The results indicated that the developed method was simple, rapid, sensitive, selective and accurate for the estimation of multiple bioactive constituents in crude mixture, and therefore could make a contribution to the quality control of Adhatoda species and its derived herbal formulations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Awantika", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sunil", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Bajpai", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Brijesh", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Justicia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27565948", "10.1002/bmc.3827"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
