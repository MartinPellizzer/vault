They frequently seek treatment from providers or with modalities considered \"alternative\" to traditional medical care. A survey of singers was completed to elucidate their attitudes and practices regarding \"alternative modalities\" of medical care. Frequently singers will self-medicate or take advice from people not well versed in the special needs of a professional voice user. They will fail to share this information with the physician when seeking \"traditional\" medical care. These practices may predispose the singer to suboptimal or even dangerous care. These results are discussed, as well as the implications for the medical physician treating the singer. The possible detrimental pharmacologic effects of \"natural therapies\" widely used by singers are presented, with special attention to the particular concerns for the professional singer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Northern Jersey Ear, Nose and Throat Associates, Midland Park, New Jersey 07432, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Surow", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lovetri", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Voice", "NlmUniqueID": "8712262", "ISSNLinking": "0892-1997"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Voice Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11021507", "10.1016/s0892-1997(00)80085-5", "S0892-1997(00)80085-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
