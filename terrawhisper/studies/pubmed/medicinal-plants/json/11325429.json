These starches were subjected to size exclusion chromatography with refractive index detection (SEC/RI). A simple and rapid method for starch solubilisation was used. The conditions during solubilisation (2 M NaOH) and separation (10 mM NaOH, 50 degrees C) were such as enabling > 94% recovery of the starch without detectable degradation. The aggregation properties of the starch was investigated using on line refractive index/multi angle laser light scattering (RI/MALLS) detection. Three major regions in the SEC profile were identified, consisting of large amylopectin aggregates, amylopectin particles with radius of gyration (Rg) of approx 200 nm (400 nm blocklets) and amylose. A procedure for correction of light scattering signals spread over the SEC profile as a result of aggregate tailing was developed. The significance of the relative amounts of these three molecular species on standard starch pasting parameters, as measured by a Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), was investigated. Starches with a high amount of amylopectin aggregates showed high peak viscosities. Moreover, very high amounts of starch bound phosphate or amylose appears to suppress the content of large aggregates resulting in low viscosity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Molecular Plant Physiology (Place), Plant Biochemistry Laboratory, Department of Plant Biology, The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, 40 Thorvaldsensvej, DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Copenhagen, Denmark. abl@kvl.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Blennow", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mette Bay-Smidt", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Biol Macromol", "NlmUniqueID": "7909578", "ISSNLinking": "0141-8130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-82-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9037-22-3", "NameOfSubstance": "Amylopectin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amylopectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amylose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Manihot"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Refractometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scattering, Radiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum tuberosum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11325429", "10.1016/s0141-8130(01)00133-7", "S0141813001001337"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
