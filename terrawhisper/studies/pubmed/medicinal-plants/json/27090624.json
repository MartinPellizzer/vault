The fish were randomly assigned to seven groups: normal control group (NC), groups treated with 12.5 g/kg FRC (FRC-L), 25 g/kg FRC (FRC-M), 50 g/kg FRC (FRC-H), 0.78 g/kg total alkaloids (TA), 0.78 g/kg berberine (BBR), and 0.78 g/kg coptisine (Cop), respectively. Results showed that the activities of myeloperoxidase, lysozyme and respiratory burst were significantly elevated after treated with FRC-M, FRC-H, TA, BBR and Cop, and the complement C3 level and phagocytic activity were significantly increased in FRC-M, TA and BBR treated groups compared with NC group. The real-time PCR analysis indicated that FRC, TA, BBR and Cop could up-regulate the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, lysozyme-c and C3, but down-regulate that of IL-10 in the head kidney of common carp. Besides, FRC-M, FRC-H, TA, BBR and Cop significantly enhanced the survival rate of common carp infected with Aeromonas hydrophila, when compared to NC group. It was concluded that the FRC could enhance the non-specific immunity and disease resistance of common carp and the main alkaloids might contribute to these effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
