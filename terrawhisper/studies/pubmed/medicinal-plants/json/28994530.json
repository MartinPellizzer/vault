The \"Qian taizishen No.1\" and \"SB-C\" varieties (strains) were used as the control varieties. The agronomic, medicinal material traits and medicine quality were used as evaluation index to compare the phenotypic difference of the three varieties (strains) in four planting areas. Compared to the control varieties, 10 agronomic traits of \"Shitai No.1\" had the smallest coefficient of variation among the 18 agronomic traits, and other 8 agronomic traits placed the middle level. Among 8 medicinal material traits and medicine quality indicators, the coefficient of variation of different regions of the extract content, pseudostellarin B content, the number of 50 g root tuber, the plant medicinal materials weight and weight of single root of \"Shitai No.1\" were the smallest compare to other varieties (strains). It could be divided into three groups based on the phenotypic difference of the three varieties (strains) in four planting areas. The \"Shitai No.1\" was classified as one group, while the \"Qian taizishen No.1\" and \"SB-C\" had cross clustering. The regional stability of several index about agronomic traits, medicinal material traits and medicine quality of \"Shitai No.1\" were better than that of the control varieties (strains). \"Shitai No.1\" was suitable for planting, popularization and application in the appropriate ecological areas of Guizhou province."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Gui", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Ji'nan, Ji'nan 250022, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "No.1 Hospital Attached to Guiyang University of Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550001, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industry Bureau of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Dafang County, Bijie 551600, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "pseudostellarin B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Caryophyllaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides, Cyclic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28994530", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170217.002"]}}]}
