Additionally, the two species are also used as dietary supplements in wine, cosmetics, and other healthy food.", "By providing comprehensive information and data of genus Boschniakia on botany, traditional medicinal uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological research and toxicology, this review aims to summary the group of natural compounds from Boschniakia discovered so far. The other aims are to reference research findings of their biological activities and functions in medicine, physiology, and cell biology to highlight the compound candidates which can be used for further drug discovery in several pharmaceutical areas including antioxidation, anticancer, anti-inflammation, anti-senile, and immunology.", "All of the available information on B. rossica and B. himalaica was collected from the electronic resources (such as PubMed, SciFinder Scholar, CNKI, TPL (www.theplantlist.org), Google Scholar, Baidu Scholar, and Web of Science).", "After a comprehensive analysis of the literatures from available online sources, the results show that both species of genus Boschniakia are valuable and popular herbal medicines with potentials to cure various ailments. The phytochemical studies revealed that the chemical compositions of this genus were mainly iridoid glycosides and phenylpropanoid glycosides. To date, 112 compounds have been isolated from the genus, while their crude extracts and purified compounds have been found to possess a wide range of biological activities including anti-senile, antitumor and anticancer, anti-inflammatory, protecting liver, boost memory, anti-oxidation, anti-lipid peroxidative, and antiviral activities.", "The existing traditional uses of the genus Boschniakia have been evaluated, and the properties of the genus are summarized based on botany, phytochemistry, pharmacological research, and toxicology. This review aims to introduce the utilization and application of the genus Boschniakia to modern drug discovery, traditional medicinal plant utilization, herbal species conservation, and the development of medicinal and health-maintaining products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
