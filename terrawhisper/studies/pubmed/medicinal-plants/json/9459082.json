The HE of D. winteri (30 to 100 mg/kg) also inhibited paw oedema induced by bradykinin (BK) (3 nmol), substance P (SP) (10 nmol) and PAF-acether (PAF) (10 nmol), in a dose-dependent manner, with mean ID50 values of 56, 63, and 58 mg/kg, respectively. However, the HE inhibited the rat paw oedema induced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (10 nmol) (29 +/- 7 and 33 +/- 2% at 60 and 240 min) to a smaller extent, and had no effect on oedema elicited by histamine (100 nmol). In adrenalectomized animals, the inhibition by the HE of D. winteri (100 mg/kg, p.o., 1 h prior) of BK-elicited oedema (3 nmol/paw) was significantly smaller when compared with that observed in control animals. When assessed in rats actively sensitised to ovalbumin (OVO), the oedema caused by OVO (6 micrograms/paw) was significantly inhibited by HE of D. winteri (30 to 100 mg/kg, p.o.), with a mean ID50 of about 65 mg/kg. The HE of D. winteri (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased survival rate when assessed in anaphylactic shock in mice actively sensitised to the antigen. The protective effect was long-lasting, being observed for up to 15 h. Dexamethasone, used as positive control (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) produced a long-lasting (up to 24 h) increase in the survival rate of the animals.", "These results confirm and extend our previous studies, and demonstrate the clear oral anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties of the active principle(s) present in the barks of D. winteri, thus confirming its reported medicinal use in folk medicine for the management of airway diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florian\u00f3polis, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Tratsk", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Campos", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vaz", "ForeName": "Z R", "Initials": "ZR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Filho", "ForeName": "V C", "Initials": "VC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schlemper", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yunes", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Calixto", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Inflamm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9508160", "ISSNLinking": "1023-3830"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Albumins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenalectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Albumins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Allergic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Foot"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9459082", "10.1007/s000110050234", "10.1007/s000110050234"]}}]}
