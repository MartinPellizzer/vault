It develops as a result of the thermal processing of food and stimulates critical impairments in male reproductive tract. Eriodictyol (Etyol) is a natural dietary flavonoid possessing diverse pharmacological potentials. The recent investigation was proposed to ascertain the ameliorative potential of eriodictyol against furan-instigated reproductive dysfunctions. Male rats (n\u00a0=\u00a048) were classified into 4 groups: untreated/control, furan (10\u00a0mg/kg), furan+\u00a0eriodictyol (10\u00a0mg/kg + 20\u00a0mg/kg) and eriodictyol (20\u00a0mg/kg). At the 56th day of the trial, the protective effects of eriodictyol were evaluated by assessing various parameters. Results of the study revealed that eriodictyol attenuated furan-induced testicular toxicity in the biochemical profile by increasing catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) along with glutathione reductase (GSR) activities, whereas reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. It also restored the normal state of sperm motility, viability, the count of hypo-osmotic tail swelled sperm as well as epididymal sperm number along with reduced sperm anomalies (morphological) tail, mid-piece and head. Furthermore, it elevated the decreased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), plasma testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as well steroidogenic enzymes (17\u03b2-HSD, StAR protein & 3\u03b2-HSD) and testicular anti-apoptotic marker (Bcl-2) expression, whereas, down-regulating apoptotic markers (Bax & Caspase-3) expression. Eriodictyol treatment also effectively mitigated the histopathological damages. The outcomes of the current study provide fundamental insights into the ameliorative potential of eriodictyol against furan-instigated testicular toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
