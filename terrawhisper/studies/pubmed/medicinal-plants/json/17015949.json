(-)-Multiflorine has an enaminone-type conjugation on the A ring, which is unusual in lupine alkaloids. Proceeding on the assumption that the A-B ring is responsible for the hypoglycemic effect, several compounds bearing the quinolizidin-2-one ring system were synthesized, and their hypoglycemic effects were examined. In addition, tricyclic compounds bearing 4-pyridone were synthesized, and their hypoglycemic effects were examined. The hypoglycemic effect of a 4-pyridone-type compound was similar to that of (-)-multiflorine as measured by oral glucose tolerance testing in normal mice. No hypoglycemic effect of a 4-piperidone-type compound was observed. These results indicate that compounds possessing double bond(s) in the A ring of multiflorine may be lead compounds for a new type of diabetes drug."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University, Ebara, Tokyo, Japan. kubo@hoshi.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kubo", "ForeName": "Hajime", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Mai", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kamei", "ForeName": "Junzo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Higashiyama", "ForeName": "Kimio", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "70G8C30AVF", "NameOfSubstance": "multiflorine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17015949", "10.1248/bpb.29.2046", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/29.2046"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
