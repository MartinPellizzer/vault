Various medicinal plants are in use traditionally and their active compounds can be further applied for treatment of bacterial diseases. This study was designed to determine the antibacterial activity of Punica granatum (P. granatum L.) (pomegranate) peel extract against Enterobacteriaceae [Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Shigella Dysenteriae (S. Dysenteriae)] and gram-positive bacterium [Staphylococcus aureus (Staph aureus)]. Methanolic extract of P. granatum L. peel was prepared by Soxhlet apparatus method. Total flavonoid and phenolic contents from the extract were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The antibacterial activity of P. granatum L. peel extract was evaluated through agar well diffusion method. HPLC showed the range of phenolics (gallic acid, caffeic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid) and flavonoid compounds. The chemical structures of flavonoid and phenolics found in the methanolic extract of P. granatum L. peel have been reported for the first time. The methanolic peel extract (50 ul) of yellow P. granatum L. showed 26, 10, 10 and 9mm zones of inhibition (ZOI) against S. aureus, S. Typhimurium, S. Dysenteriae and E. coli, respectively. The methanolic extract of red P. granatum L. (100 ul) showed 27, 8, 12 and 15 mm ZOI against Staph. aureus, S. Typhimurium, S. Dysenteriae and E. coli, respectively. Highest ZOI was observed against Staph. aureus. Many of the bacteria studied in the present work may cause serious gastrointestinal infections, which can lead to hemorrhagic diarrhea in children. These infections can be life-threatening to young children and the elderly. There is an incentive to find alternative control measures, such as plant and herbal extracts, especially in lesser-developed countries where traditional antibiotics may not be readily available."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8709-1029"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Institute of Microbiology, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mahmood", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7026-670X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ashraf", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8985-7729"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Institute of Microbiology, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8589-2292"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, GC University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddique", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0376-4391"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Asad", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7344-6212"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "R Z", "Initials": "RZ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5237-5256"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddique", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4117-5267"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aslam", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5065-4462"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Institute of Microbiology, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aslam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8147-8820"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Government College University, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rafique", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pomegranate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "19"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34431906", "10.1590/1519-6984.244435", "S1519-69842023000100161"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
