As a consequence, the nutritional utilization of these foods has only been possible through the use of a variety of treatments (cooking, fermentation, germination) which increase nutrient bioavailability. Nonetheless, some factors are not destroyed by effect of seed processing, among which stand a family of polymeric polyphenols called tannins. These pigments have the ability to complex and precipitate proteins and inhibit digestive enzymes. This paper describes what has been accomplished in regards to the selection of an appropriate solvent to extract bean polyphenols, the assessment of the most commonly used assay procedures, the purification of bean tannins and the evaluation of their interaction with proteins and digestive enzymes, responsible for their antinutritional effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Escuela de Biolog\u00eda, Universidad Central de Venezuela."}], "LastName": "Carmona", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9137636"]}}]}
