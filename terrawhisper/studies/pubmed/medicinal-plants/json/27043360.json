(Amaranthaceae), commonly known as ''spiny pigweed'', is used in both Indian traditional system and folk medicine for treatment of infectious diseases for a long time in several traditional herbal medicinal preparations.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the fatty acid was analysed by dilution method and the effects of the fatty acid on the bacterial membrane were studied in detail by flow cytometry analysis.", "All the studied bacterial strains were found to be inhibited at a concentration of 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Staphylococcus aureus ML-59, Bacillus lycheniformis 10341, Shigella boydii 8, Vibrio cholera 811, Vibrio cholera 854 and Vibrio alginolyteus were susceptible and sensitive to the tested fatty acid with a MIC value of 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL.
