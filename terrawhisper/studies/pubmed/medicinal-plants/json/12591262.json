In the present study, it was found that two precursors of sophoraflavanone G, 8-prenylnaringenin (sophoraflavanone B) and leachianone G, both of which have never been detected either in cultured cells or in the original plants, also accumulated in the added cork tissue. Thirteen minor flavonoids including three prenylated flavonoids, in addition to 8-prenylnaringenin and leachianone G, were isolated from the cork tissue co-incubated with S. flavescens cells. The new compounds flavescenones A, B and C, were determined to be (3R)-5, 7, 2'-trihydroxy-6-gamma, gamma-dimethylallyl-4', 5'-methylenedioxyisoflavanone; 5, 7, 2'-trihydroxy-6-gamma, gamma-dimethylallyl-4', 5'-methylenedioxyisoflavone and 2-[2',4'-dihydroxy-3'-(gamma-hydroxymethyl-gamma-methylallyl)phenyl]-5,6-methylenedioxybenzofuran, respectively, by means of spectroscopic analyses that included 2D-NMR techniques."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plant Garden, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki University, 1-14 Bunkyo-machi, Nagasaki 852-8521, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamada", "ForeName": "Chie", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inoue", "ForeName": "Kenichiro", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamamoto", "ForeName": "Hirobumi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "8-prenylnaringenin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "leachianone G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Prenylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quercus"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12591262", "10.1016/s0031-9422(02)00671-4", "S0031942202006714"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
