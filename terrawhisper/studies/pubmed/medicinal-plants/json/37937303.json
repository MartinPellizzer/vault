Medicinal plants reportedly produce an array of adverse reactions capable of inducing harmful conditions, including death.", "This study evaluated the subchronic toxicity concern of HF on testicular function and gonadal histoarchitecture in Wistar rats.", "Thirty Wistar rats of both sexes were randomly divided into six groups (5/group) and were orally administered HF for 60 days. The control groups received 5 mL/kg of distilled water; the treatment groups were administered 476.24 and 158.75 mg/kg body weight of HF each for both male and female rats. Using standard procedures, semen analysis was done for all male rats. Animals were anaesthetised and sacrificed on the 62nd day; the gonads were eviscerated, weighed and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathological examinations.", "Significant (p < 0.05) increase in sperm count relative to control as well as spermatotoxic effects were observed in male rats. Histologically, the ovary presented some degrees of pathologies: cloggy appearing ovarian cortex with a display of a tumour-like cortical area, scantily displayed primordial follicles, haemorrhagic blood vessels, atretic secondary follicle, and eroding granulosa cells amongst others. Testicular histopathology showed abnormal seminiferous tubules' histoarchitecture, degenerated spermatids, distorted spermatogenic cells' orientation, and displaced spermatids into the luminal space.", "Herbal drugs are usually regarded to be completely safe due to their natural sources, however, this study discovered exposure-related toxic effects of Dr Iguedo Goko Cleanser\u00ae on testicular function and gonadal histomorphology.
