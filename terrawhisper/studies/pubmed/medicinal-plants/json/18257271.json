The serum MMP-2, bone alkaline phosphates (sBAP), osteocalcin (sOC), bone cross-linked C-telopeptides of type I collagen (sCTx) and urine bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (uNTx) were measured using ELISA. BMD were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after medication at 12 and 24 weeks.", "After treatment, the values of BMD were significantly higher in MG and XLGB groups separately, otherwise lower in Leli and normal control groups. At the same time, serum MMP-2, sCTx, uNTx/Cr concentrations were significantly lower and sBAP, sOC concentrations were higher, but the concentrations in Leli and normal control groups were basically same to the value of before treatment.", "The effects of MG tablet to treat the PMO were notable, just same to XLGB.
