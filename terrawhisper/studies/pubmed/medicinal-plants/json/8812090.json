A protocol was developed to preserve A. annua hairy roots in liquid nitrogen. Root tips were excised from 7-day-old cultures and held on solid White's medium for 24 h prior to cryoprotection. They were then treated with a cryoprotecting mixture containing 8% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and 20% (w/v) sucrose at 25 degrees C for 1 h followed by cooling at 0.09 degrees C/min to 4 degrees C then cooling to -35 degrees C at 0.72 degrees C/min. Vials containing the root tips were then plunged into liquid nitrogen. After thawing in a water bath to 37 degrees C, root tips were held in the cryoprotecting mixture for 10 min before it was diluted to 25% of its original concentration. Root tips were washed once with fresh liquid White's medium and held for 1 h prior to culturing on White's medium with 0.2% Gelrite and 3% (w/v) sucrose. Regrowth of root tips averaged 65%. Independent variables in this study included 1) Me2SO concentration; 2) the type and concentration of cosolutes; 3) cooling rate(s); 4) the temperature at which the sample is transferred to liquid nitrogen; 5) the age of the culture from which root tips are taken; 6) the recovery period between root tip excision and immersion in cryoprotectant; and 7) the amount of Gelrite used in the postthaw plating medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, Massachusetts, 01609, USA."}], "LastName": "Teoh", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weathers", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cheetham", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walcerz", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "1R15AI34131-01", "Acronym": "AI", "Agency": "NIAID NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cryobiology", "NlmUniqueID": "0006252", "ISSNLinking": "0011-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-50-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Sucrose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9RMU91N5K2", "NameOfSubstance": "artemisinin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Evaluation Studies as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sucrose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8812090", "10.1006/cryo.1996.0011", "S0011-2240(96)90011-5"]}}]}
