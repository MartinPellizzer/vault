Then the stems with buds were cut and precultured at 4 degrees C for 1 day in 5% DMSO + 5% sucrose media. They were dehydrated with 60% and 100% PVS2 (30% glycerol + 15% glycol + 15% dimethyl sulfoxide + 0.4 mol/L sucrose) at 0 degrees C for 30 minutes respectively. At last the stems were immersed immediately into liquid nitrogen directly and conserved for 24 hours. After rapidly thawing in a water bath at 40 degrees C for 90 seconds, the stems were washed two times with MS media supplemented with 1.2 mol/L sucrose and 10 minutes each time, then transferred on the MS media supplemented with BA 2 mg/L and NAA 1 mg/l, in dark for 7 days and then in light. The survival rate was up to 57-58% . The regenerated plant of Pueraria lobata were the same as the normal in morphology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Life Sciences Department, Shangrao Normal College, Shangrao 334001, China. hongsenrong@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Sen-rong", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Ming-hua", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cryoprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cryopreservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cryoprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pueraria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18074831"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
