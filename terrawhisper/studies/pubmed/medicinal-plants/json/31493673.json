In this research, the physiological and signaling pathways mediating the responses to Cd stress in Scrophularia striata seedlings were characterized after they were exposed to different Cd concentrations at different time periods. The results showed that the polyamines (PAs), Abscisic acid (ABA) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) contents were significantly enhanced at 48\u202fh. Moreover, the enzyme activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL) as regulator enzymes in the phenylpropanoid pathway was increased, related to the reinforcement of phenolic compounds such as phenylethanoid glycosides (as a special compound of this plant). This metabolic profiling indicates that the signal transduction of Cd stress increased the activity of different enzymes (PAL and TAL) by regulating the PAs metabolism, the modulation of ABA, and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> content. As a result, it caused the accumulation of phenolic compounds, especially echinacoside and acteoside, both of which are required to improve the response of Cd stress in S. striata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
