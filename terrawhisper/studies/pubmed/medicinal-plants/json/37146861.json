To rapidly select D. officinale plants, we systematically investigate the differences among DOPs from different origins and analyzed the structural characteristics, such as the degree of acetylation and monosaccharide composition; the physicochemical properties, such as solubility, water absorption and apparent viscosity; and the lipid-lowering activity of the obtained DOPs. Principal component analysis (PCA), a method for analyzing multiple variables, was used to analyze the relationship between the physicochemical and structural properties, and lipid-lowering activity. It was found that the structural and physicochemical characteristics had significant effects on lipid-lowering activity, and DOPs with a high degree of acetylation, high apparent viscosity and large D-mannose-to-d-glucose ratio were associated with greater lipid-lowering activity. Therefore, this study provides a reference for the selection and application of D. officinale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
