(Bereztam) and the etiological role of plants in the rapid progression of known and unknown nephropathy toward the end stage of chronic hemodialysis.", "This was a multicentric cross-sectional study spread over 12 months (May 2019-May 2020), carried out in public hemodialysis centers in the eastern region of Morocco. Clinical data were collected from medical records. Herbal and sociodemographic data were collected from a detailed and precise interview with each enrolled CHD patient.", "A total of 404 CHD patients participated in the study. 71.5%, had used medicinal plants before the occurrence of ESKD and 32.9% had indeterminate nephropathy. Among the plants consumed, we identified plants whose kidney toxicity was well demonstrated, mainly Rhamnus alaternus L. (Mlilas) in 66.7%, Artemisia herba alba Asso (Chih) in 54.32%, Aristolochia longa L.(Bereztam) in 52.6%, and Rubia tinctorum L.

In multivariate analysis, the use of plants to treat digestive disorders (OR 9.57; 95%CI [4.49-20.37], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and asthenia associated with anemia (OR 8.59; 95%CI [3.92-18.81], P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), as well as side effects observed after taking the plants (OR 4; 95%CI [1.09, 14.7], P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), were identified as significant risk factors for the occurrence of severe indeterminate nephropathy.", "This study showed the high prevalence of consumption of nephrotoxic herbs which may be the root cause of chronic renal failure in CHD patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
