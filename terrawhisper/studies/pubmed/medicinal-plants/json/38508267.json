In order to investigate the effects of microbial inoculant, microalgae and biochar on the growth of Salvia miltiorrhiza under copper (Cu) stress, as well as its Cu absorption, antioxidant activity, active component contents and rhizosphere microbial community, a pot experiment was conducted. Salvia miltiorrhiza plants were cultivated in the soil containing 400\u00a0mg/kg of Cu for six months and treated with microbial inoculant, microalgae and biochar, either individually or in combination. Almost all soil amendment treatments led to an increase in root biomass. Notably, co-application of microbial inoculant and microalgae had the optimal effect with a 63.07\u00a0% increase compared to the group treated solely with Cu. Moreover, when microbial inoculant was applied alone or in combination with microalgae, the Cu content in plant roots was reduced by 19.29\u00a0% and 25.37\u00a0%, respectively, whereas other treatments failed to show a decreasing trend. Intriguingly, Cu stress increased the active component contents in plant roots, and they could also be enhanced beyond non-stress levels when microbial inoculant and microalgae were applied together or in combination with biochar. Analyses of plant antioxidant activity, soil properties and rhizosphere microorganisms indicated that these amendments may alleviate Cu stress by enhancing peroxidase activity, facilitating plant nutrient absorption, and enriching beneficial microorganisms capable of promoting plant growth and mitigating heavy metal-induced damage. This study suggests that the combined application of microbial inoculant and microalgae can reduce Cu levels in Salvia miltiorrhiza while enhancing its quality under Cu stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
