Thalassemia is characterized by iron overload and chelation therapy reduces iron-related complications and thereby improves quality of life and overall survival. Because of poor oral bioavailability, short plasma half-life and severe side effects of available chelators, this screening may be useful in this area. Extracts were prepared by soaking dry material of the selected plant in appropriate solvent. Phenol and flavonoid content of the extract were measured by Folin Ciocalteu and AlCl3 colorimetric assays. Phenol content of the extracts varied between 8.4-194.9 mg g(-1) of extract. The highest chelating activity was found in aerial parts of Leonurus cardiana and Grammosciadium platycarpum which had high amount of phenol and flavonoid contents. All extracts contained various amount of flavonoids from 5.9 to 90.9 mg g(-1) of extract. Weak correlations were found between phenolic and flavonoids contents and iron chelatory activity with R2 = 0.40. Extracts with high phytochemicals and chelating activity can be candidate as a good source of new agents for thalassemic patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Postal Code 48189, Sari, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ebrahimzadeh", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nabavi", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nabavi", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Leonurus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Thalassemia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19777789", "10.3923/pjbs.2009.934.938"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
