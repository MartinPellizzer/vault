Four stations were studied within the urban area of Rome: (1) Castel Giubileo, at the entry of the urban area; (2) Ponte Tor di Quinto, immediately after the confluence of the tributary river Aniene; (3) Ponte Sublicio, in the middle of the city; and (4) Ponte della Magliana, immediately outside Rome, 20 km from the sea. Since no significant increase in micronucleus frequency was observed in any of the tested stations compared to control (while in previous campaigns mutagenic activity was observed in some of the same stations), it can be assumed an interesting recovery from mutagenic pollution in the 2 last years. The samples were analysed for pH value, nitrogen, organic matter and carbonate content, and the concentration of some potentially mutagenic heavy metal ions (Zn, Cd, Ni, V, Cu) was assessed. In all samples, a concentration of heavy metals higher than unpolluted areas was observed. However, the alkaline pH measured should keep them as non-bioavailable elements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, Dip. di Biologia, Italy. minissi@utovrm.it"}], "LastName": "Minissi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lombi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fresh Water"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Italy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Water Pollutants, Chemical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9357558", "10.1016/s1383-5718(97)00093-4", "S1383-5718(97)00093-4"]}}]}
