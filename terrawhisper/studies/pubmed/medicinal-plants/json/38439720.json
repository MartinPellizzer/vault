However, homemade topical preparations can precipitate allergic and irritant reactions, depending on the herbal composition of the preparation. Hypersensitivity reactions to such preparations range from contact allergic dermatitis, contact irritant dermatitis, contact urticaria, toxic reaction, photosensitivity, and phototoxic reaction. In Europe, and especially in the Mediterranean area, medicinal herbs from the Compositae family and aromatic Mediterranean herbs are most frequently used in the formulation of topical preparations. Although plants are regarded as strong sensitizers, the number of reported cases of hypersensitivity reactions is relatively small. The problems are limitations in diagnostics due to the lack of necessary patch test substances and the danger of active sensitization during testing. Caution is required in patients prone to allergies and those with existing dermatoses, who should be advised to use registered preparations. The first step in management is cessation of exposure, followed by implementation of topical corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is reserved for more severe cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ron\u010devi\u0107", "ForeName": "Mislav", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Radas", "ForeName": "Katarina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professor Suzana Ljubojevi\u0107 Had\u017eavdi\u0107, MD, PhD, Department of Dermatology and Venereology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Ki\u0161pati\u0107eva 12, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; suzana.ljubojevic@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ljubojevi\u0107 Had\u017eavdi\u0107", "ForeName": "Suzana", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Croatia", "MedlineTA": "Acta Dermatovenerol Croat", "NlmUniqueID": "9433781", "ISSNLinking": "1330-027X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Irritants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Irritants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urticaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Atopic"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatitis, Contact"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "48"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38439720"]}}]}
