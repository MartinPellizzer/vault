Intravenous KT-362 at 10 mg/kg suppressed coronary ligation arrhythmia both at 24 and 48 hr after ligation, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24 hr coronary ligation and 48 hr coronary ligation were 6.1 +/- 1.7 and 8.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. Antiarrhythmic effects were accompanied by transient hypotension. Oral administration of 70-100 mg/kg was also effective on 24 hr coronary ligation arrhythmia. However, there was no prominent hypotension in these experiments. Intravenous KT-362 at 3 mg/kg suppressed digitalis arrhythmia; and the minimum effective plasma concentration was 3.3 +/- 1.2 micrograms/ml, which was lower than the effective plasma concentrations for coronary ligation arrhythmias. Intravenous KT-362 at 1 mg/kg also suppressed adrenaline arrhythmia; and the minimum effective plasma concentration was 1.0 +/- 0.1 microgram/ml, the lowest among the effective plasma concentrations. These pharmacological profiles of KT-362 are quite different from those of class 4 Ca antagonists, but similar to those of class 1 drugs such as propafenone. Though KT-362 has a hypotensive effect, it is effective on canine ventricular arrhythmias; thus its clinical usefulness for supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is expected."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Yamanashi Medical College, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hashimoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mochizuki", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tomiyama", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiazepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "105394-80-7", "NameOfSubstance": "KT 362"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YKH834O4BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Epinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Arrhythmias, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Vessels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thiazepines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2559225", "10.1254/jjp.51.475"]}}]}
