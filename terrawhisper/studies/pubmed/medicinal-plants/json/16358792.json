The relative yield of variable fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)), induction of fluorescence of chlorophyll, and fluorescence quenching processes in leaves at different distances from the local Kirov-Sovetsk, Kirov-Omutninsk road in Kirov region were analyzed. Changes in biophysical characteristics with the increasing content of heavy metals in leaves were demonstrated. The most informative characteristic is F(v)/F(m). Its value correlates with the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus and reflects the potential effeciency of photosynthesis. The better are the environmental conditions of plant growth, the higher is the F(v)/F(m) ratio and the lower is its average statistical deviation. Fluorescence induction curves do not always vary in shape under our ecological conditions, indicating relatively favorable conditions at places of plant growth investigated. The rate of the environmental pollution in the investigated region is not critical, since the content of heavy metal in leaves does not change considerably with the distance from the road."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Iakovleva", "ForeName": "O V", "Initials": "OV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Talipova", "ForeName": "E V", "Initials": "EV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kukarskikh", "ForeName": "G P", "Initials": "GP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krendeleeva", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rubin", "ForeName": "A B", "Initials": "AB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Biofizika", "NlmUniqueID": "0372666", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3029"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16358792"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
