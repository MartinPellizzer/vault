Nanoprecipitation, which is a simple and reproducible process, was used for nanosuspension formulation. To prepare a pharmaceutical-grade nanosuspension with the required particle size, important formulation parameters (amount of plant extract, concentration of stabilizer, and antisolvent-to-solvent ratio) were optimized using the central composite design of response surface methodology. The optimized nanosuspension was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and <i>in vitro</i> dissolution testing as well as by measuring the zeta potential. <i>In vivo</i> pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to determine the bioavailability of the prepared nanosuspension. Results of the optimization study indicated that 0.13% plant extract, 0.25% stabilizer, and an antisolvent-to-solvent ratio of 10.0 were the best parameters to obtain a homogeneous nanosuspension with the required particle size. The optimized nanosuspension demonstrated a mean particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of 172.5\u2009nm, 0.241, and -\u200916.6\u2009mV, respectively. The results of the characterization studies illustrated that the nanosuspension was in the nanometer size range and had good surface morphology. The optimized nanosuspension showed a better dissolution rate and a 3.65-fold higher oral bioavailability for the <i>P. nigrum</i> nanosuspension than its coarse suspension. The present outcomes clearly demonstrated that to obtain an effective therapeutic potential, nanoformulation of medicinal plants is a better alternative than conventional dosage forms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Zafar", "ForeName": "Fatiqa", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jahan", "ForeName": "Nazish", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "CollectiveName": "Khalil-Ur-Rahman"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bhatti", "ForeName": "Haq Nawaz", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzodioxoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyunsaturated Alkamides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U71XL721QK", "NameOfSubstance": "piperine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Benzodioxoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Piper nigrum"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Polyunsaturated Alkamides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30357764", "10.1055/a-0759-2208"]}}]}
