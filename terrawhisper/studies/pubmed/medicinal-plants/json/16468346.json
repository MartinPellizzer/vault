Little work has been reported on the tissue culture of P. major. A reproducible system for direct shoot morphogenesis and callus induction of Plantago major L. 'Giant Turkish' was described. Using seed as explants, the adventitious buds were obtained 4 to 5 weeks following incubation on MS medium supplemented with 0.2 mg/L IAA and 1.0 mg/L TDZ. The frequency of adventitious buds was as high as 100%. The average number of buds per explant was 14.6. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on 9 regenerants indicated that somaclonal variation occurred at DNA level. Using leaves as explants, calli were easily induced on MS medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/L NAA 3 weeks following inoculation. The frequency of callus induction can be as high as 98%. On MS medium containing 4.0 mg/L 6-BA, 25% of calli differentiated and the mean number of buds per piece of callus was 2.8. The buds developed roots on 11/2 MS medium and formed plantlets, 90% of which survived when transplanted to greenhouse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yin-Xin", "Initials": "YX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16468346"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
