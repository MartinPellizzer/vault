As a basis for comparison, six edible leafy vegetables known to be good dietary iron sources were also analysed for the iron content. The iron contents were determined using Atomic Absorption .Spectrophotometry in mg/100 g dry weight of the material analysed. The amounts of iron in the prepared decoctions and total iron contents in the plant parts were compared with the total amount of iron found in the dietary edible leafy vegetables. Of all the plant parts used for anaemia treatment, the iron content in the rootbarks of Adenia gummifera and Bridelia cathartica, and their respective decoctions compared well with those found in the vegetables. Comparison of the respective iron contents in the stembarks and leaves of the plants with the edible leafy vegetables was in favour of the latter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry Department, Egerton University, P.O.
