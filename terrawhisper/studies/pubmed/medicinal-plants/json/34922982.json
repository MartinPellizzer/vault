In addition, non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic probabilistic health risk assessments were evaluated by Hazard Quotient (HQ), Hazard Index (HI), and Carcinogenic Risk (CR) based on the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. According to Iranian regulation, 18% of cucumber and 22% of cantaloupe and melon samples were contaminated by at least one pesticide. Arrange pesticides based on HQ ranking was diazinon\u00a0>\u00a0thiacloprid\u00a0>\u00a0imidacloprid tebuconazole for cucumbers and chlorpyrifos\u00a0>\u00a0thiacloprid\u00a0>\u00a0imidacloprid\u00a0>\u00a0metalaxyl for cantaloupes and melons. In addition, HI for adults was 0.067 in cucumber and 0.24 in cantaloupe and melon; and for children, 0.30 in cucumber and 0.60 in cantaloupe and melon. Arrange pesticides based on CR ranking was thiacloprid\u00a0>\u00a0imidacloprid\u00a0>\u00a0metalaxyl\u00a0>\u00a0chlorpyrifos\u00a0>\u00a0tebuconazole\u00a0>\u00a0diazinon. However, CR was more than 1.0E-6 value due to thiacloprid, so consumers were at considerable carcinogenic risk in these commodities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
