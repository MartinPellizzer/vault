However, the anti-inflammatory activity of this plant had not yet been investigated. Previously, we isolated five carvotacetones (1-5) from this plant that displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines.", "The objective of this study was to isolate further constituents from S. africanus and to investigate the anti-inflammatory activity of all constituents. Furthermore, the anti-proliferative activity of the newly isolated compounds was evaluated.", "Compounds were isolated from the upper parts of S. africanus by chromatographic methods. Structures were determined using spectroscopic techniques, like NMR and MS. All nine compounds isolated from S. africanus were evaluated for inhibitory activity against COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes in-vitro, COX-2 mRNA expression and influence on NO production. The anti-proliferative activities of newly isolated compounds (6-9) were evaluated by XTT viability assay with four cancer cell lines, namely CCRF-CEM, MDA-MB-231, HCT-116, and U-251 cells.", "Two diastereomeric carvotacetones (3-angeloyloxy-5-[2\u2033S,3\u2033R-dihydroxy-2\u2033-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone (6) and 3-angeloyloxy-5-[2\u2033R,3\u2033R-dihydroxy-2\u2033-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone (7), asperglaucide (8) and chrysoplenol D (9) were isolated from S. africanus. COX-1 and COX-2 assays of compounds 1-9 revealed that compounds 1 and 2 possess potent and selective COX-2 inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.6 and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively. COX-2 gene expression assay showed that some carvotacetones exhibited inhibitory effects on COX-2 gene expression in THP-1 macrophages. Compound 4 is the most active compound inhibiting the synthesis of COX-2 by 55% at 2.06 \u03bcM. In the iNOS assay, all seven carvotacetones inhibited NO production in BV2 and RAW cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.2 to 2.9 \u03bcM. Compound 4 showed potent inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.2 \u03bcM in both BV2 and RAW cell lines. Molecular docking studies revealed the binding orientations of 1 and 2 in the active sites of COX-2. XTT assay of the newly isolated compounds revealed that the two isomeric carvotacetones (6-7) exhibited considerable anti-proliferative activity against four cancer cell lines (CCRF-CEM, MDA-MB-231, HCT-116, U-251) with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.23 to 8 \u03bcM.", "For the first-time, the diastereomeric carvotacetones (6-7) were isolated as separate compounds, and their anti-proliferative activity was determined. Selective COX-2 inhibitory, COX-2 mRNA expression and NO production inhibitory activities by some of the major constituents of S. africanus supports the traditional medical application of this plant for the treatment of inflammation-related disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier GmbH.
