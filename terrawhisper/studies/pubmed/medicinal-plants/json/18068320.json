The mixture was filtered and evaporated in vacuo to give corresponding dried extract. The activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi were performed in 96 well tissue plates each containing 10 microl aqueous plant extract dilutions (100 to 0.01 microg/ml) with 10 microl of the parasite suspension cultured in Hirumi medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum, a solution of 2% penicillin/streptomycin (2% P/S) After 4 days incubation with Almar blue\u00e2 solution, fluorescence was measured at 500 nm emission and 530 nm excitation and results expressed as percentage reduction in parasite compared to control wells. The antiplasmodial activity of was assessed in vitro against the chloroquine-sensitive Ghanaian strain of Plasmodium falciparum cultured in RPMI-1640 medium by the lactate deshydrogenase assay in the presence of plant extracts (50 to 0.01 microg/ml). Cell-lines MRC-5 were cultured in MEM medium supplemented with 20mM l-glutamine, 16.5mM NaHCO(3), 5% foetal calf serum and 2% P/S solution. After 4h incubation, cell proliferation/viability was spectrophotomecally assessed at 540 nm after addition of MTT. In each assay, the IC50 value for each sample was derived by the drug concentration-response curves.", "The extracts from Alcornea cordifolia leaves, Momordica charantia whole plant, Omphalocarpum glomerata, root bark and Piptadia africanum stem bark showed good antiprotozoal activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei with IC50 values from 0.7 to 7 microg/ml. Only Piptadenia africanum extract showed a pronounced antiprotozoal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (IC50=4.0+/-06 microg/ml). The extracts from Alchornea cordifolia, Polyathia swaveleons stem bark, Sapium cornutum stem bark and Triclisia giletii stem bark exhibited a pronounced antiplasmodial activity against P. falciparum Ghanaian strain with IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 microg/ml. Piptadenia africanum extract was the most cytotoxic sample (CC50=0.25 microg/ml) with poor selectivity against all selected protozoa (SI<10) while other active extracts did not show a significant cytotoxic effect against MCR-5 cell-lines with good selectivity according to the case.", "These active plant extracts are selected for extensive studies leading to the isolation of active constituents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Kinshasa, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, PO BOX 212, Kinshasa XI, People's Republic of Congo."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mesia", "ForeName": "G K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tona", "ForeName": "G L", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nanga", "ForeName": "T H", "Initials": "TH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cimanga", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Apers", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cos", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maes", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pieters", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vlietinck", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiprotozoal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Democratic Republic of the Congo"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trypanosoma brucei brucei"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Trypanosoma cruzi"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18068320", "10.1016/j.jep.2007.10.028", "S0378-8741(07)00555-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
