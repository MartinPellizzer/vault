The ability of spatial-learning memory of rats was evaluated by Morris Water Maze (MWM). Duxil was used as a positive control.", "the results of place navigation of MWM showed that at the 3rd time of swimming training, the escape latency of rats of the GETO group, Duxil group and Sham group were shorter than that of model group. The escape latency were (54.1 +/- 43.94), (55.9 +/- 43.49), (50.4 +/- 34.99) and (85.4 +/- 42.8) s, respectively; but there was no significantly difference. After the 6th time of swimming training, the escape latency of rats of the GETO group (37.8 +/- 38.69) s, the Duxil group (37.4 +/- 38.03) s and the sham group (26.9 +/- 21.63) s were significantly shorter than that of model rats (77.5 +/- 47.59) s, P < 0.05, respectively. Comparison of the swimming distance among groups were similar to the escape latency among groups. In the test of spatial probe, results of the ratio of the swimming time of platform quadrant (tP) vs the total swimming time (tT) and the ratio of the swimming distance of platform quadrant (dP) vs the total swimming distance (dT) indicated that the ratios of the GETO group (0.347 +/- 0.0662, 0.344 +/-0.055 1), the Duxil group (0.345 +/- 0.0984, 0.34 +/- 0.0934) and the sham group (0.35 +/- 0.0662, 0.349 +/- 0.0589) were significantly higher than those of the Model group (0.261 +/- 0.0689, 0.274 +/- 0.0544), P < 0.05, respectively.", "GETO can significantly improve the spatial learning and memory ability of rats with cerebral ischemia, which provides the pharmacodynamics evidence for its clinical application of improveing the learning and memory ability in poststroke patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institutes of Geriatrics, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100700, China. johnsontian@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jin-Zhou", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Jun-Xiang", "Initials": "JX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Li", "Initials": "XL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Cong-Sun", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Qi-Fu", "Initials": "QF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Yan", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Memory"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16722378"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
