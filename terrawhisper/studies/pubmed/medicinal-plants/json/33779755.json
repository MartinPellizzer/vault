The extracts were tested as inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidase activity and of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation. Further, radical scavenging activity was examined detecting the oxygen radical absorbance capacity, while the potential cytotoxicity of extracts was estimated with MTT assay.", "In aqueous and ethanol extracts, several polyphenolic compounds were identified; in detail, (-)-catechin and luteolin were found in leaf extracts, while caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and the terpenoid vernodalol were recognized in root extracts. Regarding antidiabetic activity, the aqueous root extracts efficiently inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 5.6 \u00b5g/ml and 39.8 \u00b5g/ml, respectively of macerated and Soxhlet extracts), whereas those obtained from leaves exhibited lower potency. Furthermore, AGEs formation was reduced by all V. amygdalina extracts starting from 10 \u00b5g/ml.", "The aqueous extracts of V. amygdalina roots obtained by maceration and Soxhlet extraction show remarkable anti-\u03b1-glucosidase activity, and all extracts have favourable antiglycation and antioxidant activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
