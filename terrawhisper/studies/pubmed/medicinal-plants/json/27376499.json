Mentha spp. are well known herbs for its flavor, fragrance and medicinal properties. In the present study, we used a computational approach to identify miRNAs and their targets involved in different secondary metabolic pathways of Mentha spp. Additionally, phylogenetic and conservation analysis were also done for the predicted miRNAs. Eleven miRNAs families were identified from Mentha spp., out of which five miRNA families were reported for the first time from Lamiaceae. Overall, 130 distinct target transcripts were predicted for eight miRNAs families. All the predicted targets regulated by predicted miRNAs control the reproduction, signaling, stimulus response, developmental and different metabolic process. miRNA mediated gene regulatory network was also constructed on the basis of hybridized minimum free energy of identified miRNAs and their targets. The study revealed that the gene regulatory system of essential oil biosynthesis may be governed by miR156, miR414 and miR5021 in mint family. Furthermore, three miRNA candidates (miR156, miR5021, and miR5015b) were observed to be involved in trichome development also. This is the first in-silico study describing miRNAs and their role in the regulation of secondary metabolic pathways in Mentha spp."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
