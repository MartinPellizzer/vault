(Apiaceae), and the calcium-antagonistic activity of the extracts was investigated. Special attention was paid to the physical and chemical properties of the solvents and their extraction abilities. The calcium antagonistic effect of the extracts was investigated by measuring the inhibition of depolarization-induced Ca2+ uptake in rat pituitary GH4C1 cells. The criteria used in determining the best solvents for the extraction were the yield and the biological activity of the extract, as well as the amount of nonpolar compounds in the extract. The final criterion used in selecting the solvent was its usability with reference to boiling point, chemical interactions (e.g. methylation), etc. Chloroform was found to be the best solvent for the extraction of nonpolar, biologically active compounds from the roots of A. archangelica."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Helsinki, Finland."}], "LastName": "H\u00e4rm\u00e4l\u00e4", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vuorela", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "T\u00f6rnquist", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hiltunen", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channel Blockers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pituitary Gland"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1529031", "10.1055/s-2006-961424"]}}]}
