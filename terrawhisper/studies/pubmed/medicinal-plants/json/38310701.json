However, the systematic purification of CBD through scalable processes has remained bottleneck due to the structural similarities of the cannabinoids. Although preparative chromatography is considered as a potential solution, it is usually time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, the development of scalable strategy via fast and accurate optimization approach is crucial. The present study aimed to develop a sequential process for the scalable purification of CBD through an eco-friendly ethanolic extraction using ultrasonic assisted extraction, decarboxylation of cannabidiolic acid optimized by response surface methodology, followed by the development of off-line two-dimensional semi-preparative chromatography, boosted with stacked injection overloading. In the first dimension, a column packed with macroporous resin allows to enrich the target substance and then, the behavior of resin column for scale-up procedure were predicted and optimized by developed mathematical model. A C18 column was used in the second dimension. The CBD purity and recovery obtained were 94.3 and 82.1 %, respectively. A robust and reliable method was employed for CBD enrichment/purification, which can be generalized to other bioactive compounds in complex matrices."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
