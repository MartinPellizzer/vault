Blanching was carried out in hot water (90 degrees C) for 15 min. The starter grew abundantly in the case of blanched garlic, producing mainly lactic acid and reaching a pH of 3.8 after 7 days, but its growth was inhibited in unblanched garlic. Ethanol and fructose, coming from enzymatic activities of the garlic, and a green pigment were formed during the fermentation of unblanched garlic, but not of blanched garlic. The blanched garlic fermented by L. plantarum, even without a preservation treatment (pasteurization), was microbiologically stable during storage at 30 degrees C in an acidified brine (approximately 3% (w/w) NaCl and pH 3.5 at equilibrium), but fructans were hydrolyzed. The packed fermented product and that obtained by direct packing without fermentation were not significantly different with regard to flavour."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de la Grasa (CSIC), Seville, Spain."}], "LastName": "de Castro", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Monta\u00f1o", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rejano", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8412849", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9580446", "10.1016/s0168-1605(98)00003-8", "S0168-1605(98)00003-8"]}}]}
