The study was undertaken at the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India, between 1988 and 1990. In patients younger than 35 years old, oral SCC occurred more commonly in females, was apparent in all social classes and was associated with fewer aetiological factors. The tumours manifested predominantly as invasive lesions affecting the tongue and there was early spread to lymph nodes. By contrast, in patients older than 60 years of age, oral SCC was more common in males, occurred more frequently in social classes III and IV and was always seen in association with smoking, alcohol or pan chewing. These latter tumours presented as exophytic lesions of the buccal mucosa or gingivae and spread late to lymph nodes. The results indicate that the biological behaviour of oral SCC in young patients may be distinct from that occurring in older patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oral Medicine, Surgery and Pathology, Bristol Dental Hospital and School, U.K."}], "LastName": "Kuriakose", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sankaranarayanan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cherian", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sugar", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scully", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prime", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cancer B Oral Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214373", "ISSNLinking": "0964-1955"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Cheek"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphatic Metastasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Staging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sex Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Class"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tongue Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1306728", "10.1016/0964-1955(92)90038-3"]}}]}
