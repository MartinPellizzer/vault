Crude protein, crude fiber and ash contents of guar and faba bean decreased as a result of all treatments with the exception of protein content in both germinated guar and faba bean. A slight decrease in lipid content was noticed during germination, while there were no changes in lipids after soaking, autoclaving and cooking. Protein content of guar was higher than of faba bean, and showed higher values for all amino acids than faba bean protein except for lysine and tryptophan. Germination caused a slight increase in total essential amino acids, while soaking caused a slight decrease in both of guar and faba bean. There was a slight decrease in the mineral contents by the heat processes with the exception of Mg and Mn for guar and Na, Mn for faba bean due to the cooking process. Germinated guar and faba bean showed noticeable decrease in Na, K, Cu, Mn and Mg and a slight increase in Fe and Zn than the raw materials. Germination was more effective in reducing phytic acid than heat treatment, and therefore it improves the nutritional quality of both guar and faba bean. Protein efficiency ratio (PER), true digestibility (DT) and biological value (BV) were estimated in all treatments under study using rat bioassay procedures. Data revealed pronounced improvements of the nutritive value as a result of all processes under study especially germination being the most effective."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Mansoura, Faculty of Agriculture, Food Industrial Department, ET-El-Mansoura, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11534462", "10.1002/1521-3803(20010801)45:4<246::AID-FOOD246>3.0.CO;2-F"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
