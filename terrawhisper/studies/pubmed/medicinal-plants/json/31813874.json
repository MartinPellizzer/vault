The plant materials obtained from these plants are used in the pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and drug industries. Tamarix dioica is locally used in the management of splenic and hepatic inflammation as well as diuretic and carminative. It also possesses cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory activity. The present study investigates the anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activities of the crude methanolic extract from Tamarix dioica. Anti-inflammatory activity was measured by Carrageenan Induced Paw Edema and Xylene Induced Ear Edema methods. Pyrexia induction with Brewer's yeast assay was used to determine antipyretic activity and analgesic activity was estimated by acetic acid induced writhing and hot plate methods. The data indicated that anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activities of the crude methanolic extract from Tamarix dioica was dose and time dependent when measured by different assays. Exposure of model animal to increasing concentrations of the plant extract for longer period increased their anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activities. Significantly highest anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and analgesic activities were noted at highest doses of the crude methanolic extract for longer exposure compared with their respective controls."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Islamia College Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Iqbal", "ForeName": "Arshad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Din", "ForeName": "Siraj Ud", "Initials": "SU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bakht", "ForeName": "Jehan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Peshawar KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Inam Ullah", "Initials": "IU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Science and Technology Bannu, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Zamarud", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antipyretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tamaricaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31813874"]}}]}
