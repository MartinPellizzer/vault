Carnosic acid (CA), a major constituent of rosemary extract, has been shown to improve metabolic abnormalities. In this experiment, the effect of CA on olanzapine-induced obesity and metabolic toxicity has been evaluated. Female Wistar rats were divided into six groups. (1) control; (2) olanzapine (5\u00a0mg/kg/day, IP); (3, 4 and 5) olanzapine (5\u00a0mg/kg/day, IP) plus CA (5, 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg/day, gavage) and (6) CA (20\u00a0mg/kg/day, gavage). Bodyweight and food intake were measured during the study. After 14 days, mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP), glycemia, serum lipid profile, the serum concentration of leptin, insulin, AMPK, P-AMPK, and P-ACC liver protein levels were evaluated. The mean weight in the group received olanzapine increased by 4.8\u00a0g at the end of the study. The average food intake was increased by olanzapine. Olanzapine increased triglyceride, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and leptin levels. It increased MSBP and down-regulated P-AMPK/AMPK ratio and P-ACC protein levels. CA (three doses) decreased body weight gain and reduced average food intake at 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg. CA especially at the highest dose decreased the changes in lipid profile, FBG, leptin level, and MSBP. P-AMPK/AMPK and P-ACC protein levels were increased by carnosic acid. In conclusion, the activation of AMPK by CA can be proposed as a key mechanism against olanzapine-induced metabolic toxicity where the activation of AMPK increases fat consumption and regulates glucose hemostasis in the liver."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Targeted Drug Delivery Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razavi", "ForeName": "Bibi Marjan", "Initials": "BM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abazari", "ForeName": "Amir Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rameshrad", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3483-851X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. hosseinzadehh@mums.ac.ir."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. hosseinzadehh@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Hosseinzadeh", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "943698", "Agency": "National Institute for Medical Research Development", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mol Biol Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "0403234", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4851"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.31", "NameOfSubstance": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "LI791SXT24", "NameOfSubstance": "salvin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7U69T4SZR", "NameOfSubstance": "Olanzapine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "enzymology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "enzymology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Olanzapine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "49"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32929650", "10.1007/s11033-020-05825-5", "10.1007/s11033-020-05825-5"]}}]}
