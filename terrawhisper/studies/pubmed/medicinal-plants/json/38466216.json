However, the underpinning molecular mechanisms remain unknown. By modulating cell division/number, ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), a key bZIP (basic (region) leucine zippers) transcription factor, regulates both seed development and abiotic stress responses. The KIP-RELATED PROTEIN (KRP) cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play an essential role in controlling cell division, and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) plays a key role in the specification of flower meristem identity. Here, our findings show that abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and/or metabolism in adjust reproductive outputs (such as rosette leaf number and open flower number) under water-deficient conditions in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants. Reproductive outputs increased under water-sufficient conditions but decreased under water-deficient conditions in the ABA signaling/metabolism mutants abscisic acid2-1 (aba2-1), aba2-11, abscisic acid insensitive3-1 (abi3-1), abi4-1, abi5-7, and abi5-8. Further, under water-deficient conditions, ABA induced-ABI5 directly bound to the promoter of KRP1, which encodes a CDK that plays an essential role in controlling cell division, and this binding subsequently activated KRP1 expression. In turn, KRP1 physically interacted with STM, which functions in the specification of flower meristem identity, promoting STM degradation. We further demonstrate that reproductive outputs are adjusted by the ABI5-KRP1-STM molecular module under water-deficient conditions. Together, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which ABA signaling and/or metabolism regulate reproductive development under water-deficient conditions. These findings provide insights that may help guide crop yield improvement under water deficiency."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
