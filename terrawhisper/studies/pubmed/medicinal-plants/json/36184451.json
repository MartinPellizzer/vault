Since glycyrrhizin (GL) is among the main components in licorice and exhibits numerous beneficial pharmacological activities, the content of GL directly affects biological activity. The quality control based on GL content is an important factor in ensuring biological activity; however, the content of GL in licorice varies depending on plant cultivation environment, genetic factors, and species type. Previously, we prepared an anti-GL monoclonal antibody (anti-GL mAb) and employed it in various immunochemical assays for quality control of licorice and licorice-based products. In this study, we employed the anti-GL mAb in chemiluminescence enzyme immunostaining (CLEIS) to develop a very simple, rapid, specific, and sensitive quality control assay for licorice products, with a limit of detection of 3.9\u2009ng. Furthermore, the CLEIS assay enabled semiquantitative analysis of GL in Kampo medicines. Our results showed that multiple samples can be simultaneously analyzed using CLEIS, and it is a useful tool for determining GL content, as well as ensuring chemical quality control of licorice-containing products and herbal medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Nutrition, Faculty of Health Management, Nagasaki International University."}], "LastName": "Fujii", "ForeName": "Shunsuke", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University."}], "LastName": "Shoyama", "ForeName": "Yukihiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Nutrition, Faculty of Health Management, Nagasaki International University."}], "LastName": "Nomura", "ForeName": "Shuichi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagasaki International University."}], "LastName": "Uto", "ForeName": "Takuhiro", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luminescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "22", "Minute": "17"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36184451", "10.1248/cpb.c22-00405"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
