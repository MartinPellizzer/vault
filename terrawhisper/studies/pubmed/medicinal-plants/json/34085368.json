To combat this issue, the use of natural herbal shampoos, as opposed to synthetic shampoos, is becoming increasingly popular. One of the many medicinal plants present in Karnataka and Kerala is Cyclea peltata. This plant has long been known to assist in wound healing, allergy relief, and hair and scalp improvement, as well as serving as a coolant for hair applications.", "The key subject of this research was the preparation of plant extracts and fermentation of Cyclea peltata leaf extract with Lactobacillus plantarum, resulting in the formulation of an herbal shampoo.", "The leaf extract contained alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acid, saponins, and proteins, according to previous research by this group. The fermented product showed the presence of lactic acid, which was a boon for shampoo base as it protects the hair from the sunlight and improves the texture and strength of hair fibers. Cyclea peltata was used as the main ingredient in herbal shampoo formulations, along with other herbal ingredients, and the formulated shampoo was characterized for its different organoleptic (Color, odor) and physicochemical properties (pH, solid content, wettability, emulsification, and foam stability) to find the best formulation.", "Formulation H2 showed better organoleptic and physicochemical properties and thus was chosen as the best formulation among the 11 formulations.", "Formulation H2 is regarded as the best formulation based on the results of the physicochemical tests (Pleasant odor, pH 3.01, solid content of 5.75%, wettability of 1.68\u00a0s, and percentage emulsification of 68.75%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAM Institute of Technology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, 574110, India."}], "LastName": "Saripalla", "ForeName": "Deeksha D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAM Institute of Technology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, 574110, India."}], "LastName": "Khokhani", "ForeName": "Nirav D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAM Institute of Technology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, 574110, India."}], "LastName": "Kamath", "ForeName": "Avanthika", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAM Institute of Technology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, 574110, India."}], "LastName": "Rai", "ForeName": "Ripika Prakashchandra", "Initials": "RP"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3751-0464"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology Engineering, NMAM Institute of Technology, Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, 574110, India."}], "LastName": "Nayak", "ForeName": "Sneha", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Cosmet Dermatol", "NlmUniqueID": "101130964", "ISSNLinking": "1473-2130"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hair Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Rhea J, Sakthivel KM, Kannan N, Guruvayoorappan C.
