The 17RAPD primers and 10 ISSR primers generated 177RAPDfragments and 110 fragments, respectively. The number of effective loci, the percentage of polymorphic loci, Shannon's Information index (I) and effective number of alleles (Ne) is in turn109, 61.58%, 0.3135, 1.3641 for RAPD makers, and 79, 71.82 %, 0.3577 and 1.4037 for ISSR markers; Jaccard's genetic similarity matrice and dendrograms for the 10 individuals were formed based on RAPD and ISSR-generated polymorphic bands. In dendrograms, they could be divided into two groups: one group containing six individuals such as Zupei 85.5, Datian 85.5, jinzhuangyuan, Jinbai, Zupei 9302 and Datian9302; the other composed of 4 ones such as Beijing No.1, Dahongpao, Dihuang 9104 and wild dihuang; the correlation coefficient of 0.649 between RAPD and ISSR markers GSs indicated that these two markers were significantly correlated. The results revealed that RAPD and ISSR markers were suitable for assessment of germplasm genetic diversity of Rehmannia glutinosa, and ISSR marker was superior to RAPD marker."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Northwest University, Xi'an710069, China. luckyqing2004@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yan-Qing", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jing", "ForeName": "Jian-Zhou", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhen-Yong", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bao-Hua", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jing-Fen", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yi Chuan", "NlmUniqueID": "9436478", "ISSNLinking": "0253-9772"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15640128", "0253-9772(2004)06-0922-07"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
