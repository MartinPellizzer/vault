However, there is a lack of scientifically supported information validating their biological activities. In this study, a total of seventeen ethanolic or aqueous extracts derived from eight Amazonian medicinal plants were evaluated for their activity against Herpes Simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and Chikungunya viruses (CHIKV). Cytotoxicity was assessed using the sulforhodamine B method, and the antiviral potential was determined through a plaque number reduction assay. Virucidal tests were conducted according to EN 14476 standards for the most potent extracts. Additionally, the chemical composition of the most active extracts was investigated. Notably, the LMLE10, LMBA11, MEBE13, and VABE17 extracts exhibited significant activity against CHIKV and the non-acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-1 (KOS) (SI > 9). The MEBE13 extract demonstrated unique inhibition against the acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-1 (29-R). Virucidal assays indicated a higher level of virucidal activity compared to their antiviral activity. Moreover, the virucidal capacity of the most active extracts was sustained when tested in the presence of protein solutions against HSV-1 (KOS). In the application of EN 14476 against HSV-1 (KOS), the LMBA11 extract achieved a 99.9% inhibition rate, while the VABE17 extract reached a 90% inhibition rate. This study contributes to the understanding of medicinal species native to the Brazilian Amazon, revealing their potential in combating viral infections that have plagued humanity for centuries (HSV-1) or currently lack specific therapeutic interventions (CHIKV)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
