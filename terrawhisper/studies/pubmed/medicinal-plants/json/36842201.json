However, the quality of medicinal plants is affected by severe cadmium pollution. Cadmium can reduce photosynthetic capacity, lead to plant growth retardation and oxidative stress, and affect secondary metabolism. Medicinal plants have complex mechanisms to cope with cadmium stress. On the one hand, an antioxidant system can effectively scavenge excess reactive oxygen species produced by cadmium stress. On the other hand, cadmium chelates are formed by chelating peptides and then sequestered through vacuolar compartmentalization. Cadmium has no specific transporter in plants and is generally transferred to plant tissues through competition for the transporters of divalent metal ions, such as zinc, iron, and manganese. In recent years, progress has been achieved in exploring the physiological mechanisms by which medicinal plants responding to cadmium stress. The exogenous regulation of cadmium accumulation in medicinal plants has been studied, and the aim is reducing the toxicity of cadmium. However, research into molecular mechanisms is still lagging. In this paper, we review the physiological and molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks of medicinal plants exposed to cadmium, providing a reference for the study on the responses of medicinal plants to cadmium stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
