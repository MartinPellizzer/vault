T Consequently, this study aimed to examine the effects of <i>Avena sativa</i> and <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> leaf extracts on immunological responses as measured by blood cytokine and liver enzyme levels. The phytochemical analysis of <i>Avena sativa</i> crude leaf extracts revealed the presence of alkaloids,flavonoids, tannins, phenolic compounds, and saponins but the absence of resins and violet oils. On the other hand, violet oils, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, and glycosides were detected in significant concentration in <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> ethanolic extract, although resins and phenolic compounds were not present. Fifty male NIH mice were randomly divided into five groups: Except for the control group, all animals were given subcutaneously and orally with extracts (50 mg/kg) for 14 days prior to LPS-induced (1 mg/kg body weight) liver injury. LPS-induced liver damage was induced on day 15, and mice were starved.Group 1 was injected subcutaneously with normal saline as a control. Group 2 received an injection of 100 l of crude oat extract subcutaneously. Group 3 was administered 100 l (50 mg/kg) of crude Oat extract orally. Group 4: administered 100 l (50 mg/kg) of crude Licorice extract subcutaneously. Group 5 ingested 100 l (50 mg/kg) of crude Licorice extract orally. IL-4 levels were significantly elevated (<i>P</i>< 0.05) in the subcutaneously and orally treated groups compared to the control group (12.3 0.23 pg/ml). IL-6 was significantly elevated (<i>P</i><0.05) in mice given subcutaneously or orally with <i>Avena sativa</i> or <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> extracts compared to mice treated subcutaneously or orally with a control substance (44 0.57 pg/ml). The concentration of TNF- was significantly elevated (<i>P</i><0.05) in subcutaneous and oral treated groups (283.6 1.7 and 280.6 12.2; 233.9 0.6 and 241.2 2.8) compared with the control group (130 0.42) pg/ml.
