The plants of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis were randomly labelled, its phenotypic traits were observed and analyzed by variation, principal component, correlation, variance and path analysis.", "Eleven phenotypic traits variation of the populations of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis were great, mainly distributed in yield, growth and genetic characteristics. Phenotypic trait of different growth years (4 - 10 years) including stem height, stem diameter, flower stem height, flower stem diameter, leaf number, leaf length and leaf width had no significant difference(P > 0. 05). The underground phenotypic traits including root weight, root length and root diameter increased significant (P <0. 05) with plant growth years. Effect of the other phenotypic traits on root weight was as follows: root diameter (0. 2550) > root growth years (0. 1183 ) > root length(0. 0202) > stem diameter(0. 0081) > stem height (0. 0044) > leaf number (0. 0025) > leaf length (0. 0018) > leaf width (0. 0004) > flower stem height (0. 0003) > flower stem diameter (0. 0001).", "The phenotypic traits on yield, growth and genetic characteristics have rich variations, and the phenotypic traits on the ground have no relationship with plant growth years, the plant growth years mainly affect the underground phenotypic traits. When choosing different root types, root diameter can be used as the preferred character, stem diameter as the second preferred traits when the root traits information not be easily obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ge", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chun-yong", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rong-ying", "Initials": "RY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-jun", "Initials": "XJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26946828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
