Whereas rodent models have been the primary focus of inflammation research, we defend the zebrafish (Danio rerio) test as a feasible alternative for preclinical studies. Moreover, despite all the technological development already achieved by humanity, nature can still be considered a relevant source of new medicines. In this context, the aim of this work was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of a substance isolated from the medicinal plant Annona crassilfora Mart, the peltatoside, in an inflammatory model of zebrafish. It was determined: (i) total leukocyte count in the coelomate exudate; (ii) N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucuronidase (NAG); (iii) myeloperoxidase (MPO); (iv) and the histology of liver, intestine and mesentery. Peltotoside (25, 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg) and dexamethasone (25\u00a0\u03bcg) were administered intracelomatically (i.c.) 30\u00a0min before carrageenan (i.c.). Pretreatment with peltatoside at three doses significantly inhibited leukocyte recruitment in the coelomic cavity, and inhibited NAG and MPO activity against the action of Cg, in a similar manner as dexamethasone. However, some microlesions in the evaluated organs were detected. The dose of 25\u00a0\u03bcg showed an anti-inflammatory effect with lower undesirable effects in the tissues. Our results suggest that the zebrafish test was satisfactory in performing our analyzes and that the peltotoside has a modulatory action in reducing leukocyte migration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
