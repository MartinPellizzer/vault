In the concentration range studied (0.1-5 mg per rat) 23-47% of the individual polyamines given intragastrically were found in the body after 1 h, with the small intestine retaining 4-12% of the dose. With spermidine or spermine, labelled polyamines accounted for 85-96% of the counts in the small intestine and between 72-82% were in the form given. However, with putrescine only 29-39% of the label found in the tissue remained in polyamine form and even less, 11-15%, as putrescine. Luminal uptake of polyamines was linear, non-saturable and was not stimulated when small intestinal growth was stimulated by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). On the basolateral side of the gut, polyamine uptake was stimulated by PHA in a time-dependent way in advance of detectable growth. Overall polyamine recoveries were high (89-99%) with intraperitoneally administered spermidine and spermine. Moreover, a large proportion of the counts in the tissue (63-89%) were still in the original form. Even with putrescine, total recoveries of polyamines (72-88%) and putrescine (24-33%) were elevated in comparison with those from the lumen. Treatment of rats with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, reduced tissue polyamine content, although it had slight effects only on basolateral polyamine transport. The PHA-stimulated increase of polyamine uptake was not abolished in the presence of DFMO."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Rowett Research Institute, Aberdeen, U.K."}], "LastName": "Bardocz", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "D S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grant", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pusztai", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ZQN1G5V6SR", "NameOfSubstance": "Eflornithine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Eflornithine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Polyamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2109637", "10.1016/0304-4165(90)90151-l", "0304-4165(90)90151-L"]}}]}
