Chen. We purified the compound that induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells and identified it as sophoranone. Sophoranone inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in various lines of cells from human solid tumors, with 50% inhibition of growth of human stomach cancer MKN7 cells at 1.2 +/- 0.3 microM. The growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities of sophoranone for leukemia U937 cells were very much stronger than those of other flavonoids, such as daidzein, genistein and quercetin. At the early stages of treatment of U937 cells with sophoranone, reactive oxygen species were formed, mitochondrial permeability pores were opened and cytochrome c was released from mitochondria. Cytochrome c was also released upon treatment of isolated mitochondria with sophoranone. Inhibitors of complexes III and IV, but not complexes I and II, of the mitochondrial respiratory chain prevented the release of cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria by sophoranone, as well as the induction of apoptosis in U937 cells in response to sophoranone. Our results indicate that sophoranone might be a unique apoptosis-inducing anticancer agent that targets mitochondria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Laboratories of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajimoto", "ForeName": "Sachiko", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takanashi", "ForeName": "Noriko", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kajimoto", "ForeName": "Tetsuya", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Man", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Judong", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "Yutaka", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aiuchi", "ForeName": "Toshihiro", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakajo", "ForeName": "Shigeo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ida", "ForeName": "Yoshiteru", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakaya", "ForeName": "Kazuyasu", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "0042124", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7136"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome c Group"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sophoranone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome c Group"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Signaling System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "U937 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12115492", "10.1002/ijc.10414"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
