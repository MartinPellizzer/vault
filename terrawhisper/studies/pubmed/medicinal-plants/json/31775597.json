The efficiency of LBA9402 was higher than A4 and MSU440 on A. tanguticus and A4 was better strain than MSU440 on P. tangutica. The hypocotyl explant was more suitable for P.tangutica and cotyledon explant was better for A.tangutica with a transformation frequency of 33.3% (P. tangutica) and 82.5% (A. tanguticus), respectively. In a flask reactor system, both the growth curves of HR for two species both appeared to be \"S\" curve; however, the HR of P. tangutica grew more rapidly than that of A. tanguticus, and the latter accumulated more biomass than the former. As the culture volume increased, the HR proliferation coefficient of both the species increased. HPLC analysis results showed that the content of TAs in the HR of P. tangutica was 257.24mg/100g\u00b7DW, which was more than that of A. tanguticus HR (251.08mg/100g\u00b7DW), and the anisodamine in the Pt- HR was significantly higher than that in At-HR. Moreover, tropane alkaloids in the HR of the two species were all significantly higher than that of the roots of aseptic seedlings.", "Our results suggest that HR of P. tangutica and A. tanguticus both could provide a useful platform for sustainable utilization of two Tibetan medicinal plants in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham
