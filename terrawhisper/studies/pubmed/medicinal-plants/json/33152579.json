Their structures were determined by mass (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic data. The absolute configuration of (4S,5S,7S,8S,11R)-7-hydroxyguai-1(10)-en-8,12-olide was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, and the configurations of (4S,7S,8S,10R,11R)-7,10-epoxyguai-1(5)-en-8,12-olide, aquilarisinone, 6-epiagarotetrol, and triepoxyhexahydrochromone A were confirmed by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations. The neuroprotective activities of the compounds were evaluated using models of BACE1 inhibition and PC12\u00a0cells with corticosterone- and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine ion (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced damage. At concentrations of 1, 2, and 5\u00a0\u03bcM, triepoxyhexahydrochromone A, (+)-(7R,10R)-selina-4,11(13)-diene-12,15-dial, (-)-(5R,7R,10R)-12,15-dioxo-\u03b1-selinene, and (+)-(1R,4S,5R)-1\u03b2-hydroxyeremophila-7(11),9-dien-8-one exerted significant protective effects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) on PC12\u00a0cell injury induced by corticosterone, while triepoxyhexahydrochromone A and (-)-(5R,7R,10R)-12,15-dioxo-\u03b1-selinene exerted significant protective effects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) on MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced PC12\u00a0cell injury at concentrations of 1, 2, and 5\u00a0\u03bcM. No compounds produced significant inhibitory effects on BACE1, with inhibition rates of less than 20% observed at a concentration of 20\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
