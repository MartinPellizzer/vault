At 1, 3, 7, 15, 30 days of incubation, samples were analyzed for soil carbon and selected enzyme activities. Results showed that biochar could increase soil organic carbon on application of highest rate of biochar addition (B3), hence potentially restored the saline soils by less C mineralization, and more sequestration of soil C. However, soil enzyme activities were biochar rate(s), day(s) of incubation and enzyme dependent. The lowest rate of biochar addition (B1) showed highest dehydrogenase (20.5\u00a0\u03bcg TPF g(-1) soil h(-1)), acid phosphatase (29.1\u00a0\u03bcg PNP g(-1) soil h(-1)) and alkaline phosphatase (16.1\u00a0\u03bcg PNP g(-1) soil h(-1)) whereas the higher rate (B2) increased the urease (5.51\u00a0\u03bcg urea-N g(-1) soil h(-1)) and fluorescein diacetate hydrolyzing activities (3.95\u00a0\u03bcg fluorescein g(-1) OD soil h(-1)) in soil. All the positive changes persisted at higher levels of salinity (S2, S3) suggesting biochar-amended soil may be potential for better nutrient cycling. Soil enzymes were found to be correlated with soil carbon and with each other while principal component analysis (PCA) extracted the most sensitive parameters as the acid and alkaline phosphatases and urease activities in the present experimental condition. This is the first time report of examining soil microbial environment using peanut shell biochar under a degraded (saline) soil."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
