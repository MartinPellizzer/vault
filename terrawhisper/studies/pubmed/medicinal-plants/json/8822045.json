One of the compounds (myrigalone B = MyB; 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-3',5'-dimethyldihydrochalcone) showed good activity in all tests whereas the others were inactive or slightly active, except that myrigalone A (MyA; 3-(1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl)-1,1,5-trimethylcyclohexane-2,4,6-trione)) like its synthetic analogue MyA* (the polar part of MyA) was nearly as active as MyB in 4). The antioxidant properties of MyB are probably due to its radical scavenging activity and may be related to its conformation, which differs from that of the other compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Oslo, Norway."}], "LastName": "Malterud", "ForeName": "K E", "Initials": "KE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Diep", "ForeName": "O H", "Initials": "OH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sund", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8702180", "ISSNLinking": "0901-9928"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "755BO701MA", "NameOfSubstance": "Bepridil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H5W525SX7Q", "NameOfSubstance": "dihydrochalcone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bepridil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8822045", "10.1111/j.1600-0773.1996.tb00190.x"]}}]}
