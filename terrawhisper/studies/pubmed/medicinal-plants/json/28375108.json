To find out the efficacy and safety of herbal coded test drug Gingocap in comparison with the control drug Pyridoxine, a randomized clinical case control study was conducted at the OPD of Yusra Medical Centre, Karachi and Amir Habib Medical Center and Maternity Home, Karachi. After administration of test and control drug the frequency of nausea and vomiting was noted after every 2 weeks on 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th weeks during 60 days of the course of study. The percentage of reduction of nausea and vomiting symptoms from the baseline in cases treated with test Gingocap compared to control drug Pyridoxine was recorded. Overall 35 and 30 patients were administered Gingocap and Pyridoxine between 6-16 weeks conception respectively. The data analyzed through T-test using SPSS version 18.0. It was concluded that Gingocap has the potential to relieve the symptoms of nausea and vomiting and exhibited no side effects and this drug was acceptable by maximum number of the patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business Development Department, Rafay Laboratories Private Limited, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rukh", "ForeName": "Lala", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Business Development Department, Rafay Laboratories Private Limited, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nazar", "ForeName": "Halima", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research and Development Department, Herbion Pakistan Private Limited, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Usmanghani", "ForeName": "Khan", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiemetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gingocap"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KV2JZ1BI6Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridoxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiemetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Morning Sickness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridoxine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28375108"]}}]}
