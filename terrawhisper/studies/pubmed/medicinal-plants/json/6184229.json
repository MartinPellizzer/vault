Losses in pea seed storage protein antigenicity have been assessed using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. Storage proteins adsorbed to wells of microtiter plates were treated with the various \"tissue preparation\" steps and reacted with 125I-antibodies to the storage proteins. The glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde fixation steps caused approximately 60% and 30% loss in antigenicity, respectively. With each subsequent preparative step, losses accumulate and following treatment with Spurr's epoxy resin reached approximately 85% and 90%, respectively. However, if Lowicryl K4M, a methacrylate-acrylate embedding medium was used, losses were retained at approximately 70% and 60%, respectively. These observations have been verified on sections of embedded material using two labelling procedures, with protein A-gold and ferritin as the markers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Craig", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goodchild", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cell Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "7906240", "ISSNLinking": "0171-9335"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epitopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Resins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fixatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1HG84L3525", "NameOfSubstance": "Formaldehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-57-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Gold"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-73-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferritins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T3C89M417N", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutaral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytological Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Epitopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Resins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferritins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fixatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Formaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glutaral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gold"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunoassay"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6184229"]}}]}
