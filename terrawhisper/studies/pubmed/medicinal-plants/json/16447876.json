All groups except the control one were continually exposed to green fluoresent light with an level of 1900 +/- 106.9 Lux for 24 hours,which was used to establish rats retinal photochemical damage model. Different doses of Yiqimingmu solutions were respectively irrigated into rats 7 days before light expose in low dose and high dose group. Saline solutions instead was used in control and model group. At 6 hours and 6,14 days after light exposed, change of electroretinogram a wave and b wave was observed.", "It was suggested that the difference of the average amplitude of ERG a wave and b wave was not significant between left eyes and right eyes in the control group. The average amplitude of ERG a wave and b wave decreased continually at the 6th hour and 6th day and uncovered at the 14th day after light exposed in the model group. In the low dose and high dose group, Yiqimingmu solutions had protective effect on lowing ERG a wave after rats retinal photochemical damage.", "Yiqimingmu solutions has protective effect on rats retinal photochemical damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yandong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Xilan", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Chengtian", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electroretinography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Retina"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16447876"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
