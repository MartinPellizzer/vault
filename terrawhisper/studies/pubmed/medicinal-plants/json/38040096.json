Heterogeneity tests of the selected trials were performed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. Random effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as the weighted mean difference with a 95% confidence interval.", "Out of 3811 records, 9 eligible RCTs were included in the current study. However, there are limitations in the included studies, which can be mentioned in the dose, duration, and type of interventions that are different among the studies, as well as the small number of included studies. All this causes heterogeneity among studies and this heterogeneity limits the consistency of the results. Our meta-analysis showed that pomegranate intake had a significant effect on lowering aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in long-term intervention (> 8 weeks), obese (BMI\u226530) individuals, or patients with metabolic disorders. Furthermore, results showed a significant decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in the long-term intervention (> 8 weeks) or in patients with metabolic disorders following the pomegranate intake. Combined results from the random-effects model indicated a significant reduction in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels (WMD: -5.43 IU/L 95% CI: -7.78 to -3.08; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001;) following the pomegranate intake. The results of Egger's test mentioned a significant publication bias for the trials examining the effect of pomegranate intake on AST (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and ALT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).", "Our results suggest that long-term pomegranate intake may be effective in ameliorating liver enzymes in adults with obesity and metabolic disorders who are more likely to have elevated baseline liver enzymes due to some degree of liver injury or tissue damage. However, some studies failed to conduct independent biochemical characterization of the product used, including the presence and quantity of polyphenols, antioxidants, and proanthocyanidins."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
