Homology modeling of RT was performed by Phyre2 and Modeller and virtual screening of ligands implemented through POAP pipeline. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (100\u2009ns) and MM-GBSA calculations were performed using Schrodinger Desmond and Prime, respectively. Phytocompounds probable host protein targets gene set pathway enrichment and network analysis were executed by KEGG database and Cytoscape software. Prioritized plant extracts/enriched fraction LC-MS analysis was performed and along with pure compound, RT inhibitory activity, time-dependent HBsAg and HBeAg secretion, and intracellular HBV DNA, and pgRNA by qRT-PCR was performed in HepG2.2.15 cell line. Among the screened chemical library of 268 phytocompounds from 18 medicinal plants, 15 molecules from <i>Terminalia chebula</i> (6), <i>Bidens pilosa</i> (5), and <i>Centella asiatica</i> (4)) were identified as potential inhibitors of YMDD and RT1 motif of HBV-RT. MD simulation demonstrated stable interactions of 15 phytocompounds with HBV-RT, of which 1,2,3,4,6-Pentagalloyl Glucose (PGG) was identified as lead molecule. Out of 15 compounds, 11 were predicted to modulate 39 proteins and 15 molecular pathways associated with HBV infection. TCN and TCW (500\u2009\u00b5g/mL) showed potent RT inhibition, decreased intracellular HBV DNA, and pgRNA, and time-dependent inhibition of HBsAg and HBeAg levels compared to PGG and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate. We propose that the identified lead molecules from <i>T. chebula</i> as promising and cost-effective moieties for the management of HBV infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
