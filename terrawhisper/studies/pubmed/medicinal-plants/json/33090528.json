Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of HIV among TB patients and evaluate the co-infection rate. The association of HIV prevalence with gender, age, and duration of treatment as risk factors was also determined. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in Omdurman Abu Anga Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan, from October 2018 to March 2019. A total of 281 blood samples were obtained randomly from pulmonary TB patients. The plasma was examined for the presence of HIV antibodies using sandwich ELISA. A structured questionnaire was used during data collection. A noticeable marker for HIV immunoglobulin M/immunoglobulin G was found in 12 patients (4.3%), of which five patients (41.7%) were diagnosed as new TB cases. Moreover, the relationship between age, sex, and duration of TB treatment and the prevalence of HIV was not significantly different (P\u2009>\u20090.05). In conclusion, the prevalence of HIV antibodies among TB pulmonary patients is high. Therefore, all TB patients should be examined for HIV risk factors and advised to undergo HIV testing. Further studies are essential to provide more insights into the epidemiology of the co-infection to better report the double burden of HIV and TB among TB patients in Sudan."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1076-9740"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Al-Kharj, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Medicinal, Aromatic Plants and Traditional Medicine Research Institute (MAPTMRI), National Center for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Moglad", "ForeName": "Ehssan H O", "Initials": "EHO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Sudan International University, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Dalia A O", "Initials": "DAO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Sudan International University, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Awad Al-Kareem", "ForeName": "Samah M M", "Initials": "SMM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, Tropical Medicine Research Institute, National Centre for Research, Khartoum, Sudan."}], "LastName": "Elgoraish", "ForeName": "Amanda G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Hatim T O", "Initials": "HTO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2635-9383"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Altayb", "ForeName": "Hisham N", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "7703966", "ISSNLinking": "0385-5600"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin M"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Coinfection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin M"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sudan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "WHO, W.H.O.
