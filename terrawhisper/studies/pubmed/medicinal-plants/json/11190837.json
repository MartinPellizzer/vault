Decorticated cracked broadbeans flour (DCBF) was used to replace 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% of the wheat flour (WF) in bread. Farinographic studies showed that water absorption, arrival time and dough development time increased as the amount of DCBF increased, while dough stability time increased at 5% and 10% of DCBF substitution and decreased at 15% and 20% substitution. Also, the extensographic energy of the dough decreased as DCBF substitution increased, while the ratio between resistence and extensibility increased. There was a decrease in peak viscosity with increased amounts of DCBF. A reduction of the diameter and weight of bread loaf was observed as the amount of DCBF increased. The sensory properties of 'Balady' bread showed that at the two levels of 5% and 10% DCBF-substitution, the 'Balady' loaves did not show any significant differences (P > 0.05). It is concluded that the replacement of bread flour (WF) with up to 10% decorticated cracked broadbeans flour produced acceptable Egyptian 'Balady' bread."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ain Shams University, Women's College, Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, ET-Heliopolis, Cairo, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Kader", "ForeName": "Z M", "Initials": "ZM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11190837", "10.1002/1521-3803(20001201)44:6<418::AID-FOOD418>3.0.CO;2-U"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
