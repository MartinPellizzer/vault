The current available literature provided an evident data concluding that the active constituents like fatty acids, flavonoids, terpenes and sesquiterpene lactones attenuate the RA symptoms by targeting the inflammatory biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of RA.", "Despite the various synthetic treatment approaches targeting immune cells, cytokines improved the quality of life but still the drug management is challenging due to toxic and chronic teratogenic effects with anti-arthritic drugs.
