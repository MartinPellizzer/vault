However, owing to similar living environments and morphological features, locals often had trouble distinguishing between these three species. In this present study, chromatograms at 350\u2009nm were obtained and the composition and content of their chemical compounds determined using HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS<sup>2</sup>. In total, 35 chemical compounds were detected, 32 of which were identified, 25 of which were xanthones, 6 flavonoids, and 1 chlorogenic acid. The 350\u2009nm chromatograms of these three species displayed evident differences. The individual compounds and their occurrence and content in different parts of the plant within different species were included in our results. This basic data will be useful for future pharmacological study. The total compositions of flavonoids and xanthones were approximately comparable in G. barbata and H. corniculata. Meanwhile, xanthones were predominant in G. acuta. From the perspective of chemical compound compositions, the leaf is recommended as the most valuable medicinal section for each of these three species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
