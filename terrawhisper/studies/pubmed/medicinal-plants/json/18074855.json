The results were as follows: The static adsorption capacity of AB-8 type resin was 104. 65 mg/g, the static elution ratio were 95.9% , the dynamic adsorption capacity of AB-8 type resin was 96.5 mg/g, the recovery rate was more than 91.24% and the purity was more than 90%. AB-8 type resin was the best for separating and purificating Macleaya cordata in total alkaloids. The optimum conditions is: the eluant is 90% alcohol and 2-3 times as the volume of the resin, the volume of the resin is 10.4 times of total alkaloids in sample, concentration of total alkaloids of sample is 21.57 mg/ml and current velocity of 2-3 ml/min, pH value of sample is 7-8."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tongren Vocational Institute, Tongren 554300, China. yujiansheng@sohu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jian-sheng", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jian-ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Synthetic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adsorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Papaveraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Synthetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Technology, Pharmaceutical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18074855"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
