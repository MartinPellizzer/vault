Female rats were divided into: (1) Control, (2) Sham, (3) Sham-Tamoxifen (Sham-T), (4) Ovariectomized (OVX), (5) OVX-Tamoxifen (OVX-T), (6)OVX-Soy(OVX-S) and (7) OVX-S-T. The animals in the OVX-S, OVX-T and OVX-S-T groups received soy extract (60\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.), tamoxifen (10\u00a0mg/kg) or both for 2 weeks before induction of seizures. The animals in these groups additionally received the mentioned treatments before each injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 40\u00a0mg/kg) for 6\u00a0days. The animals in the Sham and OVX groups received a vehicle of tamoxifen and soy. A significant decrease in the seizure score and TUNEL-positive neurons was seen in the OVX group compared to the Sham (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The animals in both the OVX-T and OVX-S groups had a significantly higher seizure score as well as number of TUNEL-positive neurons compared to the OVX group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01-P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Co-treatment of the OVX rats by the extract and tamoxifen decreased the seizure score and number of TUNEL-positive neurons compared to OVX-S (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Treatment of the OVX rats by either soy or tamoxifen increased the seizure score as well as the number of TUNEL-positive neurons in the hippocampal formation. Co-administration of tamoxifen and soy extract inhibited the effects of the soy extract and tamoxifen when they were administered alone. It might be suggested that both soy and tamoxifen have agonistic effects on estrogen receptors by changing the seizure severity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Microanatomy Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimzadeh-Bideskan", "ForeName": "Ali Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Somaieh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ataei", "ForeName": "Mariam Lale", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Grogan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jahanshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.
