It is therefore important to find new active ingredients to combat parasites. Herbal products such as essential oils (EOs) may show promise in treating infections caused by gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs). This study investigated the in vitro anthelmintic activity of the EOs of Lavandula angustifolia and Quercus infectoria against Marshallagia marshalli. The in vitro study was based on an egg hatch test (EHT), adult and larval motility inhibition tests, DNA damage, and several biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress, including superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione peroxidase [GSH -Px], protein carbonylation [PCO], malondialdehyde [MDA], total antioxidant status [TAS], and nitric oxide levels [NO]. Different concentrations of Lavandula angustifolia and Quercus infectoria EOs (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50\u00a0mg/ml) were used to determine the anthelmintic effect on three stages of the life cycle of M. marshalli, i.e. eggs, larvae and adult parasites, for 24\u00a0hr. The results showed that EOs of L. angustifolia and Q. infectoria play an important role as anthelmintics. These essential oils significantly reduced the egg hatching and motility of larval and adult worms. This anthelmintic effect is dependent on concentration and time. Furthermore, the EOs of L. angustifolia and Q. infectoria caused oxidative/nitrosative stress (reduced SOD, GSH-Px and CAT and increased MDA, PCO and NO) and DNA damage, thereby providing significant antihelminthic effects. Based on the results, it seems that the EOs extracted from L. angustifolia and Q. infectoria may be effective in the control and treatment of M. marshalli infections. Further research is needed to investigate their potential for in vivo use in the treatment of parasitic infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
