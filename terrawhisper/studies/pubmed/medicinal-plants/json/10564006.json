Both the 50% ethanol-water extracts and the aqueous extracts were boiled in a modified laboratory microwave oven and in a water (or oil) bath, respectively. The neutral ginsenosides (Rb(1), Rc, Rd, and Re) and malonyl ginsenosides (m-Rb(1), m-Rc, and m-Rd) were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that the degradation of ginsenosides in 50% ethanol-water extracts was a first-order reaction. The malonyl ginsenosides were much less stable than the corresponding neutral ginsenosides, with the rate constant value of the malonyl ginsenosides being 3-60 times that of the neutral ginsenosides. At the same temperature, the effect of microwave heating on the degradation of ginsenosides was the same as that of conventional heating."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, The University of Hong Kong."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microwaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10564006", "10.1021/jf980678m", "jf980678m"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
