A leaf blight/spot disease was first discovered on nearly 90% of C. tamala plants with a mean severity of 48% to 74.4% in Gazipur and Bogura, Bangladesh, in 2019. The present study identified and characterized the causal organism and formulated the optimum growth conditions and effective fungicides for the chemical control of the pathogen. The characteristic symptoms on the infected leaves appeared circular to oval reddish-brown spots with raised margins and often developed in tear-stain patterns. Severe infection of C. tamala sapling resulted in dieback symptoms with leaf defoliation. A fungus with floccose, dense, white colonies with well-differentiated acervuli was isolated from the infected leaves. Combined cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics identified the pathogen as Colletotrichum siamense. Inculcating healthy leaves and 1-year-old saplings of C. tamala with a conidial suspension of the fungus reproduced the same symptoms observed in the bay leaf orchard. The highest mycelial growth was recorded on V-8 Juice Agar media, while the maximum radial mycelial growth and level of sporulation of the fungus were significantly higher in incubation temperature 30\u00b0C. Fungicide trials showed that carbendazim 50 WP, azoxystrobin, mancozeb, and trifloxystrobin, either singly or in combination, successfully reduced fungal mycelial growth in vitro. Therefore, disease management strategies should be opted to halt the further spread of this issue. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document the incidence of Colletotrichum leaf blight on C. tamala in Bangladesh and even in the world."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Pathology Division, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Momotaz", "ForeName": "Rumana", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Pathology Division, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Khondoker M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Pathology Division, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Arifunnahar", "ForeName": "Most", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Seed Technology Division, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Crops Division, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Alam", "ForeName": "Md M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5667-7510"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Hossain", "ForeName": "Md M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agricultural University (BSMRAU), Gazipur, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Siddique", "ForeName": "Shaikh S", "Initials": "SS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Basic Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8503885", "ISSNLinking": "0233-111X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Colletotrichum siamense"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colletotrichum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southern"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sharma V, Rao LJM.
