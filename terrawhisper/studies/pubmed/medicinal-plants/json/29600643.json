In recent years, with the surge in consumption, the resources are declining, the use of market varieties are constantly changing. In this paper, Production and sales situation of the five species contained in pharmacopoeia(Epimedium brevicornu, E. sagittatum, E. pubescens, E. koreanum and E. wushanense) have been studied on the basis of the existing researches, in-depth investigation and collection of accurate plant specimens and samples. And the origins of Epimedii Folium regulated by the pharmacopoeia have been discussed. At the same time, more exclusive and practical features have been summarized on the basis of observation and comparison with the stereo, optical and stereo-fluorescence microscopy technologies, and refering the related literatures on leaf structure and anatomy.The results of this study will provide a useful reference for the clinical medication, supervision, inspection, and standard drafting and so on."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Shuai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Chao-Jie", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Ai-Hua", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100050\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Shuang-Cheng", "Initials": "SC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29600643", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180105.006"]}}]}
