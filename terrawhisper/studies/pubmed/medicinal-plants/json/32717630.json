In preliminary studies, the major active fraction responsible for its hemostatic effect have been confirmed to be Rhizoma Bletillae polysaccharide (RBp), but the hemostatic mechanism of action of RBp is still unknown.The main aim of this study was to clarify its mechanism of hemostatic effect. RBp was prepared by 80 % ethanol precipitation of the water extract of Rhizoma Bletillae followed by the Sevag method to remove proteins. The average molecular weight (Mw) of the crude RBp maintained at a range of 30.06-200 KDa. The hemostatic effects of RBp were evaluated by testing its effect on the platelet aggregation of rat platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP was dealt with different concentrations of RBp and platelet aggregation was measured by the turbidimetric method. The hemostatic mechanism of RBp was investigated by examining its effect on platelet shape, platelet secretion, and activation of related receptors (P2Y<sub>1</sub>, P2Y<sub>12</sub> and TXA2) by electron microscopy and the turbidimetric method. RBp significantly enhanced the platelet aggregations at concentrations of 50-200 mg/L in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory rate of platelet aggregation was significantly increased by apyrase and Ro31-8220 in a concentration-dependent manner, while RBp-induced platelet aggregation was completely inhibited by P2Y<sub>1</sub>, P2Y<sub>12</sub> and the PKC receptor antagonists. However, the aggregation was not sensitive to TXA2. RBp, the active ingredients of Rhizoma Bletillae responsible for its hemostatic effect, could significantly accelerate the platelet aggregation and shape change. The hemostatic mechanism may involve activation of the P2Y<sub>1</sub>, P2Y<sub>12</sub>, and PKC receptors in the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
