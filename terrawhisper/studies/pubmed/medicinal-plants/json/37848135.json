In the current study, 33 microorganisms were isolated from different fruit sources, and their screening for target GDL production was performed. Using DNA sequencing, two potential strains yielding good amounts of GDL were identified from pineapple and strawberry fruits. The identified strains were Metschnikowia vanudenii (OP954735) and Candida parapsilosis (OP954733), and further optimized by Taguchi method. The effectiveness of lactone production is influenced by the rate of microbial growth under various operating conditions. The factors such as substrate concentration, pH, temperature, cell density and rotation (rpm) with 3 levels were applied for the GDL production using M. vanudenii (OP954735) and C. parapsilosis (OP954733) strains. The results revealed that the highest molar conversion of GDL was 24.69% (115.7\u202fmg/g quantitative yield) and 52.69% (272.0\u202fmg/g quantitative yield) at the optimal conditions using SB-62 and PA-19 strains, respectively. The two novel strains are reported for the first time for production of \u03b3-decalactone and overall, this study opens up the possibility of using Taguchi design for large scale up process development for producing food flavours utilising environmentally friendly natural strains."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
