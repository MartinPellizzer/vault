Today, nanotechnology has played an important role in green chemistry and the use of nanoparticles in the removal of environmental pollutants is one of the newest methods of removing pollutants in the world. So, in this study, Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) of this work were successfully synthesized\u00a0via\u00a0a green method by the usage of nickel nitrate hexahydrate as the source of metal and Biebersteinia multifida extract as the stabilizing agent throughout different annealing temperatures. The physicochemical properties of the obtained NiO NPs were characterized through the application of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), ultraviolet visible (UV-vis), and Raman analysis. According to the results of SEM and PXRD, the prepared product contained a satisfying distribution and very fine cubic structure with minimal accumulation. The average crystal size of prepared nanoparticles was obtained 54-58\u00a0nm. The energy band gap of synthesized NiO NPs was calculated 3-3.7 using Tauc equation. The photocatalytic performance of NiO NPs was investigated under visible light through the decolourization reaction of acid orange 7 (AO7) dye in aqueous solution. Being composed at 300\u00a0\u00b0C of annealing temperature, these nanoparticles exhibited excellent adsorption and photocatalytic activity (90.2%) toward AO7 dye. Therefore, it can be indicated that the synthesized NiO NPs demonstrated an excellent dispersion in dye solution, as well as considerable photocatalytic activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
