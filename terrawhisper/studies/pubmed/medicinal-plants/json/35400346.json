Consequently, various diabetic models have been developed and enhanced over the years. The objective of this review is to describe some of the experimental models to study the effect of medicinal plants used to control postprandial hyperglycemia. Data was collected from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google scholar (1953-2021). Fiftyseven (57) studies were included in this review article. Ten models were identified and described. For each model, we described the targets involved and their roles in postprandial blood glucose control. The experimental design and procedures described the targets such as an \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme, SGLT1, GLUT2, DPP-IV, Na+/K+ ATPase pump, or intestinal motility in the models, experiment design and procedures were described. This review will facilitate the selection of the most appropriate model for studying agents used to investigate postprandial blood glucose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bio-Resources, Biotechnologies, Ethnopharmacology and Health, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohamed Ist 60 000, Oujda, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Abid", "ForeName": "Sanae", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bio-Resources, Biotechnologies, Ethnopharmacology and Health, Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University Mohamed Ist 60 000, Oujda, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Bnouham", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Diabetes Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101253260", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3998"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Theoretical"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35400346", "10.2174/1573399818666220408100830", "CDR-EPUB-122386"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
