Conventional therapies offer limited success and often come with various adverse effects. Therefore, the exploration of alternative therapies, such as phytoconstituents, may be of substantial interest for their potential to alleviate neuropathic pain.", "This review systematically examines the diverse roles and mechanisms of various phytoconstituents in modulating neuropathic pain. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of phytoconstituents in neuropathic pain is carried out to understand their mechanism in preventing the disease.", "The current search is done in the databases of Google Scholar, PubMed Central, ScienceDirect, and Scopus using the keywords: neuropathic pain, phytoconstituents as analgesics, physiological effects of medicinal plants, and natural products, to find the most relevant articles of the last 10 years.", "Out of 125 articles, 112 were included in this study, which revealed that several phytoconstituents inhibit several biomarkers responsible for neuropathic pain.
