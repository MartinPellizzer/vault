HXZQ was administrated from the day of diarrhea induction at dosage of 5.21 g kg(-1) and 0.52 g kg (-1) respectively. Peyer's patch and periphery lymphocytes were prepared for flow cytometry, and level of TNF-alpha in periphery and enteric tissue homogenate were determined with ELISA. Student's t-test was used for statistics.", "Mice in BSD group started showing continuous diarrhea at the day of induction till the fourth day when the mice were sacrificed. Diarrhea in the mice of HXZQ high and low groups lasted for 36 and 54 h respectively. There were more CD4+ and CD8+ cells in periphery, less CD4+ cells in peyer's patch in BSD mice comparing to normal mice. In peyer's patch, there were more CD8+ cells in mice in HXZQ high and low groups and more CD4+ in mice in HXZQ high group. Higher level TNF-alpha in periphery and intestinal tissue homogenate in BSD group were observed. Mice in HXZQ high group showed the decreased level TNF-alpha in periphery and enteric tissue homogenate.", "The immune regulation on peyer's patch CD4+ and CD8+ cells and suppression on TNF-alpha level in enteric homogenate might partially explain the effect of HXZQ on improvement of BSD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Pharmaceutical Engineering Center (NPEC) for Solid Preparation in Chinese Herbal Medicine, Nanchang 330006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Ying-hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Xiao-jian", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Xing-wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Zhi-peng", "Initials": "ZP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Ai-ping", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Huoxiang-zhengqi"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4-CD8 Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colon"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dysentery, Bacillary"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Mucosal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Peyer's Patches"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "metabolism", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Shigella dysenteriae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18257268"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
