It has been widely used in grain, vegetables, fruits, flowers and other crops, and become an important technical guarantee for high yield, stable yield, high quality and efficient production of crops. In recent years, plant growth regulator is widely used in Chinese herbal medicine production for regulating the growth and development and increasing production of traditional. However the crop is different from general Chinese medicinal materials, the use of plant growth regulator should not only consider the effect of Chinese herbal medicine production, and also pay special attention to the influence of Chinese traditional medicine efficacy and safety. This paper reviewed the application of plant growth regulator in the traditional Chinese medicine, the impact on the quality and safety of Chinese medicinal materials, as well as plant growth regulator of residue limits standards and testing technology, so as to the scientific use of plant growth regulator, to promote Chinese standardization planting, provide the scientific basis to protect the safety of herbal medicine. At present, the indiscriminate use and abuse of plant growth regulators such as Zhuanggenling and bulking element are common in the production of Chinese crude drugs, which has led to a significant decline in the quality of some Chinese crude drugs, and resulted in the dual residual harm to the Chinese crude drugs and the cultivation environment, causing serious safety risks to human health. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the registration management, use norms and limit standards of plant growth regulators in traditional Chinese medicinal materials, and strengthen the supervision and regulations on the use of fertilizer instead of medicine to avoid pesticide registration and other disorders, so as to provide a basis for the quality and safety monitoring of traditional Chinese medicinal materials. Simultaneously, it is encouraged to reduction or non-application of plant growth regulators in the production of Chinese medicinal materials, especially for traditional Chinese medicine which contains a variety of active ingredients. Therefore, it is actively advocated to cultivate Chinese medicinal materials through organic or ecological method."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dai and Southern Medicine in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Jinghong 666100, China Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Li-Xia", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dai and Southern Medicine in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Jinghong 666100, China."}], "LastName": "Mou", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mei-Hua", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dai and Southern Medicine in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Jinghong 666100, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Dai and Southern Medicine in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Branch Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Jinghong 666100, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "De-Ying", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zu-Liang", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32489066", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200205.105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
