If not managed properly, it can lead to life threatening complications, organ failure and mortality. Research has recognized that diabetes can be prevented and managed by following proper lifestyle which includes diet and exercise. Though a number of synthetic drugs are available for managing this condition, their long-term use is associated with many side effects. This has shifted the research towards medicinal plants and herbs which are considered to be comparatively safe. Edible mushrooms belong to the class of potential anti-diabetic phytotherapy. They are rich in natural compounds such as fibers, polysaccharides, phenolics and alkaloids and known for providing antidiabetic, antioxidant and antihyperlipidemic effects from ancient times. Moreover, mushroom polysaccharides also act as prebiotics and modulate the composition of gut microflora; and thus, can reduce insulin resistance. The present review discusses the pathophysiology of diabetes and, elaborates some potential mushroom species that are known to have antihyperglycemic activities. Different mushroom polysaccharides modulating the composition of gut microflora in diabetic animal models have also been discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
