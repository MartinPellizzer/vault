We studied consecutive patients (n = 141) who were receiving digoxin. Measurements included digitalis toxicity, defined by ECG criteria and resolution after stopping digoxin; all additional medications (including antiarrhythmics) continued. The observer was \"blinded\" to serum digoxin level and to concomitant drugs.", "Digitalis toxicity rates were as follows: digoxin alone, 4.9% (5 of 101 patients); with amiodarone or verapamil, 5.0% (1 of 20 patients); with quinidine, 50% (10 of 20 patients) (p < 0.01). No toxicity was seen at digoxin levels < 1.0 ng/ml. Toxicity at 1.0 to 2.0 ng/ml was as follows: digoxin alone, 1 of 41 patients; with quinidine, 4 of 15 patients (p = 0.014). Toxicity was similar at levels > 2.0 ng/ml: 4 of 8 patients and 7 of 11 patients, respectively. Independent relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of digitalis toxicity were as follows: serum digoxin, 9.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 13.0); concurrent quinidine, 24.3 (95% CI, 3.4 to 124). There was a significant (p < 0.01) interaction between concurrent quinidine, serum digoxin of 1.0 to 2.0 ng/ml, and digitalis toxicity.", "The digoxin-quinidine interaction significantly increases digitalis toxicity, even in the therapeutic range of serum digoxin levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel."}], "LastName": "Mordel", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Halkin", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zulty", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Almog", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ezra", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Pharmacol Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0372741", "ISSNLinking": "0009-9236"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "73K4184T59", "NameOfSubstance": "Digoxin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ITX08688JL", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Digoxin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Quinidine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8477562", "10.1038/clpt.1993.51"]}}]}
