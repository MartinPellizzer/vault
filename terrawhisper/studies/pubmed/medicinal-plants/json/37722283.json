However, the viruses that infect P. notoginseng and the effects of viral infections on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and photosynthesis remain unknown. This study identified a variety of viruses infecting P. notoginseng plants via deep-sequencing of small RNA (sRNA). Of the 10 identified viruses, seven had not previously been detected in P. notoginseng, including Cauliflower mosaic virus and Soybean chlorotic mottle virus. In addition, the simultaneous infection of P. notoginseng by Panax notoginseng virus A (PnVA), Panax cryptic virus 4 (PCV4), and Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) was confirmed by PCR. Moreover, a quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of key genes related to saponin biosynthesis were generally down-regulated in the virus-infected P. notoginseng. Additionally, high-performance liquid chromatography results indicated the saponin content decreased in the roots of virus-infected P. notoginseng plants. The activities of photosynthesis-related enzymes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase, decreased significantly in the virus-infected P. notoginseng plants. The viral infections also induced the expression of antioxidant genes and increased antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, the expression levels of many resistance-related genes were up-regulated in P. notoginseng plants inoculated with a viral suspension. The study results provide the foundation for future research on P. notoginseng viral diseases, which may lead to the development of enhanced disease control measures."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
