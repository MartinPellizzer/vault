Today, discovering safe and effective therapeutic modalities for brain tumors is among the top research interests. Immunotherapy is an emerging area of investigation in cancer treatment. Since immune checkpoints play fundamental roles in repressing anti-cancer immunity, diverse immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been developed, and some monoclonal antibodies have been approved clinically for particular cancers; nevertheless, there are significant concerns regarding their efficacy and safety in brain tumors. Among the various tools to modify the immune checkpoints, phytochemicals show good effectiveness and excellent safety, making them suitable candidates for developing better ICIs. Phytochemicals regulate multiple immunological checkpoint-related signaling pathways in cancer biology; however, their efficacy for clinical cancer immunotherapy remains to be established. Here, we discussed the involvement of immune checkpoints in cancer pathology and summarized recent advancements in applying phytochemicals in modulating immune checkpoints in brain tumors to highlight the state-of-the-art and give constructive prospects for future research."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
