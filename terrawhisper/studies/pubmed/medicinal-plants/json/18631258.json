Twenty-seven per cent (n=80) used a combination of both. Twenty per cent (n=59) potentially compromised their HIV management through using CAM therapy. Ten per cent (n=29) were advised to stop their CAMs and 15% (n=43) were made aware of potential drug interactions and adverse effects and were advised to monitor their care.", "There are potentially significant health risks posed by the concomitant use of CAMs in patients taking ARV therapy.
