A mixture of 17 reference compounds was used to study the separation mechanism. A crude water extract of Flos Carthami was applied to evaluate the performance of the novel 2D-LC system. In the first dimension, the extract was eluted with a gradient of water/methanol over a cross-linked dextran gel Sephadex LH-20 column. Meanwhile, the advantages of size exclusion, reversed phase partition and adsorption separation mechanism were exploited before further on-line reversed phase purification on the second dimension. This novel on-line mixed-mode Sephadex LH-20\u00d7RPLC method provided higher peak resolution, sample processing ability (2.5mg) and better orthogonality (72.9%) versus RPLC\u00d7RPLC and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)\u00d7RPLC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a mixed-mode Sephadex LH-20\u00d7RPLC separation method with successful applications in on-line mode, which might be beneficial for harvesting targets from complicated medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
