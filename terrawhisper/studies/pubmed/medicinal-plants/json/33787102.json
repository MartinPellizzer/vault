Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis is a rare plant species mainly distributed in China. Wild individuals have been overexploited for the last few decades because of increasing demand for such medicines. Therefore, it is great significance to study the phylogeography of P. poliphylla var. yunnanensis based on chloroplast gene trnL-trnF sequences. In this study, chloroplast genes trnL-trnF were used in the phylogeography analysis of 15 wild and 17 cultivated populations of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. This study revealed that based on the results of neutrality tests and mismatch analysis, the rapid expansion of wild population has not been detected in P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. After aligning and sorting the obtained cpDNA sequences, a total of 15 haplotypes were detected in all 32 populations. One haplotype was unique to the wild population, and 5 haplotypes were unique to the cultivated population. It can be seen that the haplotype richness of cultivated population was higher than that of wild population. The wild populations of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis were divided into two groups according to evolutionary relationship of haplotypes and distribution map of haplotypes. The haplotype of branch \u2160 was mainly distributed in Guizhou, and the haplotype of branch \u2161 was located in Yunnan and Huidong, Sichuan. Therefore, it's speculated that Guizhou and the west Yunnan region may be glacial refuge in the evolutionary history of wild populations of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis, and in order to protect the wild resources more effectively, wild populations of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis in these two areas should be included in the protection zone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Chemistry,Dali University Dali 671000,China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Chemistry,Dali University Dali 671000,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "De-Quan", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Chongqing Engineering Laboratory for Green Cultivation and Deep Processing of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area's Medicinal Herbs,College of Food and Biological Engineering,Chongqing Three Gorges University Chongqing 404120,China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Nong", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Chloroplast"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melanthiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeography"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33787102", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20201011.102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
