Usually consumed as a vegetable, Struchium sparganophora is indicated in traditional herbal medicine as one of the plants used in treating tumor-related ailments.", "This claim was examined using bench-top assay methods involving the cytotoxicity of the methanol extract of the leaves to tadpoles of Raniceps ranninus at 10, 20, 40 and 80 \u03bcg/ml. Also, the growth inhibitory effects of the extract on guinea corn radicle at 0.5, 1.0, 2 and 4 mg/ml in addition to evaluation of the phytochemical constituents of the leaves was performed. After 24 h, the crude extract and the chloroform fraction produced the highest cytotoxicity of 96.67 \u00b1 4.71%, each at a concentration of 80 \u03bcg/ml, while the aqueous fraction produced 100% cytotoxicity at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml.", "The crude extract had an LC50 of 26 \u03bcg/ml, the chloroform fraction had 6.25 while the aqueous fraction had 5 \u03bcg/ml. On the inhibition of the guinea corn radicle growth, after 96 h, the controls had an average length of 67.81 \u00b1 2.6 mm, whereas the seeds treated with 4 mg/ml of the crude extract had an average length of 35.83 \u00b11.75 mm, indicating 47.81% reduction in length. At the same concentration, the chloroform and the aqueous fractions showed 32.51 and 43.81% inhibitions. The plant material was observed to contain alkaloids, tannins, saponins and flavonoids, with no traces of anthracene derivatives.", "The results suggest the probable use of the plant in preparing recipes for tumor-related ailments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ayinde", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agbakwuru", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of Interest:</b> None declared"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Geneva: WHO; 2002.
