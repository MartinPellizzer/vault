However, various studies have underscored a lesser incidence of urolithiasis in cohorts predominantly consuming fruits and vegetables. This article aims to review various dietary plants, medicinal herbs and phytochemicals in the prevention and management of urolithiasis.", "To provide context and evidence, relevant publications were identified on Google Scholar, PubMed and Science-Direct using keywords such as urolithiasis, nephrolithiasis, urolithiasis, renal stones, phytochemicals and dietary plants.", "Growing bodies of evidence suggest the incorporation of plant-based foods, medicinal and herbal supplements, and crude drugs containing phytochemicals into the staple diet of people. The anti-urolithiatic activity of these plant bioactives can be attributed to their antioxidant, antispasmodic, diuretic, and inhibitory effect on the crystallization, nucleation and crystal aggregation effects. These mechanisms would help alleviate the events and symptoms that aid in the development and progression of renal calculi. In addition, it will also avoid the exacerbation of secondary disorders like inflammation and injury, which can initiate a vicious circle in turn worsening the disease progression.", "In conclusion, the results presented in the review demonstrate the promising role of various dietary plants, medicinal and herbal supplements, and phytochemicals in preventing and managing the precipitation of uroliths. However, more conclusive and cogent evidence from preclinical and clinical studies is required to substantiate their safety, efficacy and toxicity profiles in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
