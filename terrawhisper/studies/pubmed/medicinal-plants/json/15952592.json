The viability of cells was detected by MTT assay. Cell injury was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the extracellular medium. Flow cytometry was employed to observe the occurrence of apoptosis. Morphologic changes of cells were visualized under phase contrast and electron microscopes.", "Hydrogen peroxide (200 micromol x L(-1) for 4 hours) inhibited the viability of cultured BCMEC and stimulated LDH release. Hydrogen peroxide (100 micromol x L(-1) for 4 hours) induced the occurrence of apoptosis. Hydroxyethylpuerarin was shown to increase the survival rate and decrease the activity of LDH of BCMEC damaged by hydrogen peroxide. Hydroxyethylpuerarin was also found to protect BCMEC against apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide.", "Hydrogen peroxide induces BCMEC injury either by apoptosis or through necrosis.
