The molecular weight of this purified enzyme has been recorded as 88,500 by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography, and in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis one protein band containing three subunits of Mr 32,000 each was discernible. Km values for NAD+ and myo-inositol 1-phosphate have been recorded as 2.8 X 10(-4) and 5.0 X 10(-4) M, respectively. Production of NADH in myo-inositol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction has also been evidenced by measurement of NADH fluorescence. Dehydrogenation and decarboxylation of myo-inositol 1-phosphate are mediated by the same enzyme. In fact, the rate of dehydrogenation corroborates with that of decarboxylation. Stoichiometry of this reaction suggests that for the production of 1 mol of ribulose 5-phosphate 2 mol of NAD+ are reduced."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De", "ForeName": "B P", "Initials": "BP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Biswas", "ForeName": "B B", "Initials": "BB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulosephosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0U46U6E8UK", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4151-19-3", "NameOfSubstance": "ribulose 5-phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "myo-inositol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Point"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulosephosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6696433", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90072-9", "0003-9861(84)90072-9"]}}]}
