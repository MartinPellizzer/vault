The molecular dynamic (MD) simulation investigations were conducted using the Desmond tool of Schr\u00f6dinger molecular modelling. This study identified the top ten highest binding energy phytochemicals that were taken for drug-likeness test and ADMET profile prediction with the help of the web-based server QikpropADME.", "Molecular docking study revealed that ellagic acid (-9.3 kcal/mol), emodin (-9.1 kcal/mol), rhein (-9.1 kcal/mol), andquercetin (-9.0 kcal/mol) phytochemicals showed similar binding affinity as standard tamoxifen towards the target protein ER\u03b1. MD studies showed that all four compounds possess comparatively stable ligand-protein complexes with ER\u03b1 target compared to the tamoxifen-ER\u03b1 complex. Among the four compounds, phytochemical rhein formed a more stable complex than standard tamoxifen. ADMET studies for the top ten highest binding energy phytochemicals showed a better safety profile.", "Additionally, these compounds are being reported for the first time in this study as possible inhibitors of ER\u03b1 for treating breast cancer, according to the notion of drug repurposing. Hence, these phytochemicals can be further studied and used as a parent core molecule to develop innovative lead molecules for breast cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Chemistry Research Laboratory, MNR College of Pharmacy, Sangareddy 502294, Gr.
