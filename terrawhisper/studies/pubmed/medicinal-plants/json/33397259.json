Allopathic medications are not efficient enough in controlling DM and its complications. Therefore, much attention has been directed towards the traditional medicine system. Plant derived-natural compounds with medicinal properties play an essential role in DM management and treatment. Artemisia is a varied and widespread genus of the family Asteraceae, which has more than 500 species with beneficial economic and therapeutic significance. Electronic databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, medRixv, and Wiley were used to search scientific literature. In folklore medicine, Artemisia species have been widely utilized for diabetes management. Molecular investigations have revealed that the NF-\u03baB suppression, Notch 1 inhibition, cell cycle stop at S+G2/M-phase, enhanced Bax protein concentrations, mitochondrial membrane potential attenuation, activation of p53 and caspase, Bcl-2 regulation, and ROS formation are crucial mechanisms that could be targeted via various Artemisia species. Anti-diabetic effects of single or multiple doses of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of Artemisia species are due to the presence of bioactive compounds, and they are completely efficient in lowering levels of blood glucose in experimental examinations. In spite of the available anti-diabetic drugs, therapeutic agents obtained from the mentioned plants have been used for the treatment of this disease and its complications with less adverse impacts. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence indicated that Artemisia species could be introduced as a potential therapeutic candidate in the treatment and management of diabetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharafati-Chaleshtori", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nickdasti", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mortezapour", "ForeName": "Erfan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Razi Drug Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourhanifeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hossein", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazanfari", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Movahedpour", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khatami", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Science, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ashrafizadeh", "ForeName": "Milad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sabanci University Nanotechnology Research and Application Center (SUNUM), Tuzla, 34956, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Zarrabi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anatomical Sciences Research Center, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahabady", "ForeName": "Mahmood Khaksary", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan 23200, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khani", "ForeName": "Haroon", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Biochemistry and Nutrition in Metabolic Diseases, Institute for Basic Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Hamed", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Mol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101093076", "ISSNLinking": "1566-5240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33397259", "10.2174/1566524020999210101234317", "CMM-EPUB-112984"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
