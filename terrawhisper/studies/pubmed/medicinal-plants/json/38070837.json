Various constituents of traditional medicines have been found to be effective against coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in several clinical trials and in-silico studies. Sudarshana c\u00farna, a polyherbal Ayurvedic medicine, has been used over thousands of years for a variety of infectious fevers.", "This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Link Natural Sudarshana (LNS) tablets, in patients with COVID 19 disease. LNS is a polyherbal preparation comprising 49 medicinal plants included in the Sudarshana c\u00farna.", "A randomized parallel-group double-blind placebo-controlled multi-center phase II clinical trial was conducted in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease. They were randomly allocated to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received LNS tablets whereas the control group received placebo tablets for 10 days or until the patient was discharged from the hospital. All patients received standard symptomatic treatment. The primary outcome, a reduction in mean log viral load was assessed at day 5 of treatment. The secondary outcomes, clinical progression and safety, were assessed by, monitoring changes in symptoms daily on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 and laboratory tests respectively.", "A total of 171 patients (treatment group 83, control group 88) completed the trial. There were no significant differences between the baseline status of the two groups except that body mass index was significantly higher in the placebo group. The mean log viral load reduction at day 5 was higher in the treatment group (2.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.67) compared to the placebo group (1.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.80), with a mean difference of -0.278. This difference was not statistically significant at the 5% significant level. Reduction of mean cumulative symptom score, which included 16 symptoms graded according to severity, was higher in the treatment group compared to the placebo group. This difference was not statistically significant. None of the study participants developed hypoxia. Among the 7 lymphopenia patients in the placebo group, 3 continued to have lymphopenia at day 10, whereas 9 lymphopenia patients in the treatment group, reverted to normal counts. C reactive proteins (CRP) showed a greater reduction in the treatment group. None reported adverse effects. No significant changes occurred in hematological and biochemical parameters that assessed safety.", "LNS is safe to use in COVID-19 patients and accelerated the decline in viral load, relieved symptoms, reduced CRP levels and reversed lymphopenia earlier, when compared to the placebo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
