We studied the effects of compounds 1-5 on isolated smooth muscle and of compounds 1-10 on the cardiovascular system. These compounds showed dose-related antagonistic effects on histamine- and Ca(2+)-induced contractions in smooth muscle and the potencies were in the order 2 greater than 1 greater than seselin (3) greater than xanthyletin (4) = 2.2.10-trimethyl-2H,8H-benzo[1,2-b: 3,4-b']dipyran-8-one (5). All the compounds except 7-geranyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (10) produced a dose-related increase in vertebral, carotid and femoral blood flow. Compounds 1, 5, and 4-methyl-7-(3-methyl-2-butenyloxy)coumarin (8) caused an increase in blood pressure, but 3 and 4 caused a slight decrease. Compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 increased heart rate. Jatamansinone (6) and jatamansinol (7) caused only slight changes in blood pressure. All the compounds except 10 increased heart rate. Compound 1 also increased blood flow in the cerebral cortex. Thus, compound 1 was confirmed to have an inhibitory effect on contraction in isolated smooth muscle and an action increasing arterial blood flow. Among the compounds tested in this study, 3, as well as 6 and 7 synthesized on the basis of 3, showed actions similar to those of Ca2+ blockers and some compounds had papaverine-like activities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Showa College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Takeuchi", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kasama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aida", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oki", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maruyama", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tobinaga", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1934161", "10.1248/cpb.39.1415"]}}]}
