Considering the vast plant wealth and with an objective to explore these untapped potentialities of oilseed resources of NE India, a research program was undertaken. The present communication is based on the investigation of seeds of 14 lesser known plant species for fats and oils. The screened plant species exhibited oil yield ranging from 4.71% to 48.43% on dry weight basis. Alseodaphne andersonii showed significant amount of tocols while Garcinia xanthochymus showed significant amount of phytosterol. Gas liquid chromatography analysis of methyl ester extracted fatty acid indicated dominant fraction of Oleic acid in 6 numbers of species, followed by Linoleic acid in 3 species, Lauric acid in 3 species, and Palmitic acid in 2 species. The majority of the species (9 species) showed higher amount of unsaturated fatty acid content in the oils which suggested that the species may serve as valuable raw materials for vegetable oil which can be explored as substitute for industrial feasibility while restshowed higher amount of saturated fatty acids which suggested that these species may serve as important industrial by-products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
