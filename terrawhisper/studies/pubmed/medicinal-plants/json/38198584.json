The compounds were isolated using extensive chromatography techniques and identified as psiguanol (<b>4</b>), as new compound along with guajadial (<b>1</b>), psidial A (<b>2</b>), <i>\u03b2</i>-caryophyllene (<b>3</b>), quercetin (<b>5</b>), avicularin (<b>6</b>), guaijaverin (<b>7</b>), hyperin (<b>8</b>), rutin (<b>9</b>), ursolic acid (<b>10</b>), corosolic acid (<b>11</b>), asiatic acid (<b>12</b>), <i>\u03b2</i>-sitosterol (<b>13</b>), <i>\u03b2</i>-sitosterol-D-glucoside (<b>14</b>), ellagic acid (<b>15</b>), 3,3',4'-trimethylellagic acid 4-O-glucoside (<b>16</b>), protocatechuic acid (<b>17</b>), gallic acid (<b>18</b>), and tricosanoic acid (<b>19</b>) as known molecules. The compound <b>16</b> was isolated for the first time from this plant. The isolated compounds were evaluated for vasorelaxation activity in rat aorta cells and it was observed that compound <b>4</b> exhibited the most potent vasorelaxation response in the <i>ex-vivo</i> model in isolated rat aorta cells. Mechanistically, the vasorelaxation activity of <b>4</b> was mediated through cGMP-dependent BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel opening."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR- Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Shraddha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR- Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Bisht", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Savita", "ForeName": "Kumari", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR- Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Kishan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Rani", "ForeName": "Poonam", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioprospection Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Chanda", "ForeName": "Debabrata", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR- Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Dev", "ForeName": "Kapil", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38198584", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2294477"]}}]}
