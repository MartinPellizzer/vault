The co-morbidities associated with CVD are observed from infancy to old age. Apolipoprotein B100 (Apo B) is the primary apolipoprotein and structural protein of all major atherogenic particles derived from the liver including Very-Low- Density Lipoproteins (VLDL), Intermediate-density Lipoprotein (IDL), and Low-density Lipoprotein (LDL) particles. It has been suggested that measurement of the Apo B concentration is a superior and more reliable index for the prediction of CVD risk than is the measurement of LDL-C. Nutraceuticals and medicinal plants have attracted significant attention as it pertains to the treatment of non-communicable diseases, particularly CVD, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The effect of nutraceuticals and herbal products on CVD, as well as some of its risk factors such as dyslipidemia, have been investigated previously. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of these natural products, including herbal supplements and functional foods (e.g. fruits and vegetables as either dry materials, or their extracts) on Apo B has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper was to review the effect of bioactive natural compounds on plasma Apo B concentrations. It is concluded that, in general, medicinal plants and nutraceuticals can be used as complementary medicine to reduce plasma Apo B levels in a safe, accessible, and inexpensive manner in an attempt to prevent and treat CVD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Food Security Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bagherniya", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri, United States."}], "LastName": "Johnston", "ForeName": "Thomas P", "Initials": "TP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apolipoproteins B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins, VLDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32338202", "10.2174/0929867327666200427092114", "CMC-EPUB-106151"]}}]}
