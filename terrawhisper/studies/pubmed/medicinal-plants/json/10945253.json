In this study, we explored other candidates for the enzyme inhibitor in Chinese medicinal plants. Some of them were antimutagenic toward 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2). For example, Rheum officinale contained large amounts of anthraquinones as the active compounds, 3.4 mg of emodin, 2.1 mg of chrysophanol and 1.8 mg of rhein in 10 g of dry matter. Anthraquinones showed similar IC50 values for antimutagenicity against Trp-P-2 to those for inhibition of the N-hydroxylation activity of CYP1A1 toward Trp-P-2, indicating that the antimutagenicity was attributable to CYP inhibition. The structure-activity relationships were then examined with 14 commercial chemicals, and it was found that the interaction with an enzyme required three rings and an oxygen group in the side ring. This characteristic is similar to that of flavones and flavonols."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Kobe University, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sakakibara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashida", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Danno", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanazawa", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "775UJ9HCTR", "NameOfSubstance": "3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido(4,3-b)indole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10945253", "10.1271/bbb.64.1373"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
