The use of antiseptics in milking, if properly used, can lead to a reduction in potentially pathogenic microorganisms and their transmission between herds. Several medicinal plants have antiseptic potential, including eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.). Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of wood vinegar from Eucalyptus urograndis clone GG I144 (EU) as an antiseptic in vitro and in vivo; in addition, to its cytotoxicity and antimicrobial resistance. Fifteen bovines were used, lactating females 3-6 years of age and divided into three groups of five animals each. The wood vinegar was placed in the teats of the animal for 28 days and collections of cellular debris were performed every 7 days. At the Veterinary Microbiology Laboratory (LAMIV) of UFERSA, the samples were processed and serial dilution was performed in Petri plates with plate count agar (PCA) at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Cytotoxicity was verified based on morphological alterations and metabolic activity. Morphological changes were not observed in all cells incubated with 1\u00a0% pyroligneous extract. The in vitro data demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. agalactiae, Salmonella, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium were resistant to penicillin (PEN), rifampicin (RIF), nitrofurantoin (NIT), erythromycin (ERI), and ciprofloxacin (CIP). The extract was used in vivo in the post-dipping of dairy cows, which reduced the microbiological load present in the mammary glands from 4.74 to 2.54 CFU, indicating its future use as an antiseptic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
