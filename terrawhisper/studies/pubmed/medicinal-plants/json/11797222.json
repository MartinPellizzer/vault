The effects of agitation speed, aeration and inoculum size on cell growth and flavonoids production were studied and it was found that cells had optimum growth and flavonoids production when cultivated at 75 r/min, 700-1000 L/min and an inoculum of 4.0-5.0 g/L. A high cell biomass of 13.8 g/L and flavonoids production of 416 mg/L were achieved after 12 days of cultivation. Time course study revealed that flavonoids biosynthesis was growth-associated. The studies on aggregates size distribution in the bioreactor showed that the aggregates break-up caused by hydrodynamic stress might adversely affect cell growth and lead to significant reduction of cell biomass and flavonoids production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Beijing, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "D X", "Initials": "DX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Z H", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "H Z", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Q", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11797222"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
