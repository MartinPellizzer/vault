The structures of all obtained compounds were determined by chemical properties and spectroscopic evidence, accompanied by comparisons with data in the literature. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) was performed for compounds 1-4 to confirm the absolute configuration. Compounds 1-3 and 8-10 were evaluated for the protective effect on osteoblasts. Compound 1 was observed to increase the proliferation of dexamethasone (DEX)-treated MC3T3-E1 cells significantly at 1\u00a0\u03bcM, which was comparable with the positive control geniposide at 10\u00a0\u03bcM. The results were further confirmed by flow cytometry analysis. In addition, compound 1 increased the level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization in osteoblasts inhibited by DEX. Moreover, Compound 9 (vanillic acid) showed a pronounced inhibition (IC<sub>50</sub> 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u03bcM) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and 10 (4-O-methyl gallic acid) showed a good inhibition with IC<sub>50</sub> as 103.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0\u03bcM, compared with the standard drug ibuprofen (IC<sub>50</sub> 54.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00a0\u03bcM). Besides, compounds 1-3 and 8-10 were non-cytotoxic against MCF-7, NCI-H460, Hela, and BJ cell lines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
