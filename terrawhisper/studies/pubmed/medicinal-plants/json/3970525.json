Three acidic lectins (I, II, and III) (pI approximately 5.5) were purified to apparent homogeneity by chromatography on Ultrogel AcA44 and SP-Sephadex C-25. These lectins are glycoproteins with relative molecular mass of 54,000. The total carbohydrate content of the acidic lectins was 7% and was comprised of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, and xylose in amounts corresponding to 9.2, 4.8, 1.6, and 7.0 mol/54,000 g, respectively. Electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate, in the presence and absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, gave a single subunit of apparent relative molecular mass 30-32,000, somewhat higher than expected from the native relative molecular mass. On isoelectric focusing in 8 M urea the subunits of the acidic lectins did not show any significant charge heterogeneity as found for the winged bean basic lectins. The acidic lectins have very similar amino acid compositions. They contain essentially no half-cystine, 1-2 methionine residues, and are rich in acidic and hydroxy amino acids. The amino-terminal sequences of lectins II and III were identical while the amino-terminal sequence of lectin I contained five differences in the first 25 residues; the acidic lectins showed extensive sequence homology with the winged bean basic lectins, the other one-chain subunit lectins and the beta subunit of the two-chain subunit legume lectins. The acidic lectins agglutinated trypsinized human (type A, B, AB, and O) erythrocytes but not trypsinized rabbit erythrocytes. They were inhibited by various D-galactose derivatives and D-galactose-containing disaccharides and trisaccharides. N-Acetylgalactosamine was the best inhibitor, and the specificity appears to be directed to beta-D-galactosides. However, compared with winged bean basic lectins and soybean lectin, the winged bean acidic lectins show a low affinity for the inhibitory sugars."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kortt", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoelectric Focusing"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3970525", "10.1016/0003-9861(85)90657-5", "0003-9861(85)90657-5"]}}]}
