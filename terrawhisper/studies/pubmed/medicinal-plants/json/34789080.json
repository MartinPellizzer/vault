In this context, <i>Licania rigida</i> Benth (Chrysobalanaceae Family), a large evergreen tree distributed in Brazilian semi-arid regions, deserves attention for its widespread use in popular medicine, although its biological properties are still poorly studied. The aim of this study was to examine (1) acute and sub-chronic oral toxicity at 2000 mg/kg dose; (2) <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity at 0.1; 1; 10; 100 or 1000\u00a0\u00b5g/ml; (3) <i>in vivo</i> mutagenicity at 5, 10 or 20 mg/ml, and (4) potential antioxidant protective effect of <i>L. rigida</i> aqueous leaf extract of (AE<i>Lr</i>). No marked apparent toxic and genotoxic effects were observed using <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays after <i>in vitro</i> treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) with AE<i>Lr</i> or <i>in vivo</i> exposure of Wistar rats and <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to different extract concentrations. Concerning the antioxidant effect, the extract exhibited a protective effect by decreasing lipid peroxidation as determined by malondialdehyde levels. No significant changes were observed for glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Data demonstrate the beneficial potential of AE<i>Lr</i> to be employed for therapeutic purposes. However, further studies are required to validate the pharmacological application of this plant extract to develop as a phytotherapeutic formulation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
