It is frequently associated with obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ginger (<i>Zingiber officinale</i> Roscoe) supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have NAFLD. In a two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, seventy-six patients diagnosed with both T2DM and NAFLD were randomly assigned to receive either ginger powder capsules (1000 mg, twice daily) or placebo capsules (administered in the same manner) for a period of three months. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure readings, biochemical profiles, and imaging parameters were assessed before and after the intervention. Safety measures were also evaluated. In both the ginger and placebo groups, there was a significant reduction in mean body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, as well as liver transaminase levels. Moreover, significant improvements in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were observed in the ginger group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.02 and <\u20090.0001, respectively). Within the ginger group, there was a decrease in serum insulin levels and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.002 and 0.004, respectively). Furthermore, the ginger group exhibited an improvement in serum HDL-cholesterol level (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01). However, there were no significant changes in the assessed inflammatory markers or the indices obtained from fibroscan imaging, including steatosis percent and controlled attenuation parameter. This study demonstrates that ginger supplementation can significantly improve mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures. However, it does not have a significant impact on inflammatory markers or fibroscan imaging indices. Nonetheless, the three-month use of ginger improves serum insulin level, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and HDL-cholesterol level compared to baseline values. Further investigations with longer durations and larger sample sizes are recommended."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghoreishi", "ForeName": "Parissa Sadat", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3210-0159"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolism Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shams", "ForeName": "Mesbah", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4630-2082"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nimrouzi", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytopharmaceuticals (Traditional Pharmacy), School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zarshenas", "ForeName": "Mohammad M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Policy Research Center, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Lankarani", "ForeName": "Kamran Bagheri", "Initials": "KB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fallahzadeh Abarghooei", "ForeName": "Ebrahim", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Independent Gastroenterologist."}], "LastName": "Talebzadeh", "ForeName": "Mozaffar", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6700-9304"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Department of Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashempur", "ForeName": "Mohammad Hashem", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Randomized Controlled Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Diet Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "101249830", "ISSNLinking": "1939-0211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Insulins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37817641", "10.1080/19390211.2023.2263788"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
