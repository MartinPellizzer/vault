This effect at least partially was connected with the genoprotective action of the given preparation. As a result, normalization of free radical chromatin lipid peroxidation reaction, modified at the intoxication, as well as partial correction of physical and chemical properties of chromatin protein-lipid complex were those molecular mechanisms of genoprotective action of BTK-8L, which were manifested by the influence of the preparation on such indices which characterized the depth structure of the complex as microviscosity and energy transfer from the protein to the lipid probe. Investigation of the interaction of the preparation with chromatin fractions in vitro and comparison of this interaction with the analogous process in model systems allowed revealing determinative participation of chromatin proteins and lipids in the given process. The preparation interacted more intensively with the active chromatin fraction, which contained a more marked protein-lipid complex, as comparing to the repressed one. Injection of the preparation also normalized such indices as relation between the chromatine fractions and protein/DNA ratio in them. On the contrary, injection of the alcoholic solution of the preparation to experimental animals, aggravated genotoxic tetrachloromethane action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gubski\u012d", "ForeName": "Iu I", "Initials": "IuI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Levitski\u012d", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kholodova", "ForeName": "Iu D", "Initials": "IuD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goriushko", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Primak", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vistunova", "ForeName": "I E", "Initials": "IE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sachenko", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Mekhanizmy genoprotektornogo de\u012dstviia preparata na osnove fito\u00e9kdisteroidov (BTK-8L) v usloviiakh povrezhdeniia khromatina tetrakhormetanom."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ukraine", "MedlineTA": "Ukr Biokhim Zh (1978)", "NlmUniqueID": "7804246", "ISSNLinking": "0201-8470"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "BTK 8L preparation"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Steroids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Steroids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8048185"]}}]}
