Numerous potent inhibitors have been discovered and kinetically characterized thanks to this technology. However, when inhibitors of these important enzymes are screened, PK inhibitors or activators are very often observed. In this study we report solutions to resolve the problems encountered either during the screening or during the kinetic characterization of glycosyltransferase inhibitors by means of PK-coupled assays. The enzyme under study-WaaC-is an important glycosyltransferase involved in the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis pathway. Firstly we showed that alternative kinases such as nucleoside 5-diphosphate kinase (NDPK), myokinase (MK), and ADPdependent hexokinase that catalyze similar reactions to PK are prone to the same troubles. Moreover, an ADP chemosensor was used as an alternative but the sensitivity was not sufficient to allow a proper screening. Finally, we found that a stepwise PK/luciferase assay resolved the problems encountered with PK inhibitors and that a WaaC HPLC assay allowed the identification of WaaC inhibitors acting as PK activators, thus allowing false positive and false negative results linked to the coupling to PK to be eliminated."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
