Although Cichorium plants have been studied for their phytoconstituents and biological activities, there is limited knowledge about the constituents of the roots of C. bottae. A phytochemical study of the 90% MeOH extract of C. bottae roots resulted in the isolation of twelve compounds belonging to guaianolide sesquiterpene lactones, sesquiterpene lactone glucosides, and phenolic derivatives, of which two compounds designated as 9\u03b1-hydroxycrepediaside B (1) and cichobotinal (2) were previously undescribed. The isolated compounds were assessed for their anti-inflammatory potential through the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and resultant decrease in nitric oxide generation in LPS-induced macrophages. Among the isolates, compounds 2 and 11 (8-deoxylactucin) inhibited iNOS activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 and 6.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. The methanolic extract of C. bottae inhibited iNOS with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
