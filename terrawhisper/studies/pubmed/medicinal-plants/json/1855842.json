The median values of NPRO and the sum of four nitrosamino acids analysed were 0.28-0.84 micrograms/12 h and 0.75-1.75 micrograms/12 h, respectively. The NPRO level after proline intake was significantly higher in children from a high-risk area than in those from a low-risk area (p less than 0.04), and markedly reduced after ingestion of ascorbic acid and proline (p less than 0.05). Urinary nitrate level was lower than that of adults. NPRO levels on the day of proline intake, however, correlated well with nitrate levels (p less than 0.001), indicating that children in a high-risk area in Costa Rica have high endogenous nitrosation potential. Blood samples were also collected from about 300 children (aged 7-20 years) and analysed for antibodies against Campylobacter pylori, a suspected gastritis-causing bacteria. About 71% of children in both high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer had antibodies. In addition, raw and cooked beans, which are consumed very frequently in Costa Rica, were collected from families in both areas and analysed for levels of nitrite/nitrate, total N-nitroso compounds and genotoxicity in the SOS chromotest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Costa Rica, San Jos\u00e9."}], "LastName": "Sierra", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohshima", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu\u00f1oz", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Teuchmann", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pe\u00f1a", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malaveille", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pignatelli", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chinnock", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "el Ghissassi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "IARC Sci Publ", "NlmUniqueID": "8009542", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5038"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrosamines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Costa Rica"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter pylori"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrosamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1855842"]}}]}
