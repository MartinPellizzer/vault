The reaction was applicable to electron-deficient, electron-rich arenes, heteroarenes, and alkyl groups. Control experiments were conducted to explore the reaction mechanism and reveal that the byproduct formed in situ is the catalyst for this reaction and a tether derived from trifluoropyruvate is a key intermediate for this reaction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1878-6614"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yuan-Yong", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Guo", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Cheng", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ying-Xian", "Initials": "YX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji-Quan", "Initials": "JQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "BGI-Shenzhen , Building 11, Beishan Industrial Zone , Yantian, Shenzhen , 518083 , China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9751-1602"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yong-Long", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&D , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang , 550014 , China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Org Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "100890393", "ISSNLinking": "1523-7052"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30859824", "10.1021/acs.orglett.9b00522"]}}]}
