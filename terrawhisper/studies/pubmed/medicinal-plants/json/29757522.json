Wolbachia, a maternally inherited bacterial symbiont, are distributed in various arthropod species and can induce cytoplasmic incompatibility, i.e., reduced egg hatch, in certain crosses. It is being considered as a tool for population control of mosquito disease vectors. The Aegean region is characterized by highly populated, rural, and agricultural areas and is also on the route of the migratory birds. In this study, a fragment of the 658 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, which includes the barcode region, was employed to differentiate Cx. pipiens complex species found in this region. Moreover, for the first time, the prevalence of Wolbachia endobacteria in these natural populations was examined using PCR amplification of a specific wsp gene. Our results revealed a widespread (more than 90%, n=121) presence of the highly efficient West Nile virus vector Cx. quinquefasciatus in the region. We also found that Wolbachia infection is widespread; the average prevalence was 62% in populations throughout the region. This study provided valuable information about the composition of Cx. pipiens complex mosquitoes and the prevalence of Wolbachia infection in these populations in the Aegean region. This information will be helpful in tracking mosquito-borne diseases and designing and implementing Wolbachia-based control strategies in the region."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 The Society for Vector Ecology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Kocman University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, 48100 Kotekli, Mu\u011fla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mor\u00e7i\u00e7ek", "ForeName": "Bur\u00e7in", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Kocman University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, 48100 Kotekli, Mu\u011fla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Taskin", "ForeName": "Belgin Gocmen", "Initials": "BG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Koycegiz Vocational School, Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Mugla Sitki Kocman University Mugla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Do\u011fa\u00e7", "ForeName": "Ersin", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ula Vocational School, Department of Bee Breeding, Mugla Sitki Kocman University Mugla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Do\u011faro\u011flu", "ForeName": "Taylan", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Mu\u011fla S\u0131tk\u0131 Kocman University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, 48100 Kotekli, Mu\u011fla, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Taskin", "ForeName": "Vatan", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "9512496", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1710"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9007-43-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes c"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Culex"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes c"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Wolbachia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29757522", "10.1111/jvec.12281"]}}]}
