As part of continuing projects to discover bioactive natural products from traditional medicinal plants with pharmacological potential, phytochemical investigation of the root bark of this plant was carried out. This led to the successful isolation of a new chromane derivative (1) and 22 known compounds: catechin derivatives (2-5), megastigmane glycoside (6), dihydrochalcone glycosides (7 and 8), flavanone glycosides (9 and 10), coumarins (11 and 12), lignan derivatives (13-17), and phenolic compounds (18-23). The structure of the new compound (1) was determined with 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and HR-ESIMS, and its absolute configurations were achieved by chemical reactions and the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR chemical shifts calculations. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their potential biological activities including neuro-protective, anti-neuroinflammatory, and anti-Helicobacter pylori activities. Among the isolates, compounds 1, 8, and 20 displayed stronger potency by causing a greater increase in the production and the activity of nerve growth factor (NGF) in C6 glioma cells (147.04\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.87, 206.27\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.70, and 143.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.88%, respectively), whereas compounds 11, 14, and 19 inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine microglial cells (IC<sub>50</sub> of 18.72, 12.31, and, 21.40\u202f\u00b5M, respectively). In addition, compounds 1, 11, 18, and 20 showed anti-H. pylori activity with MIC values of 25 or 50\u202f\u00b5M against two strains of H. pylori 51 and 43504. These findings provide scientific evidence that supports the traditional usage of U. davidiana var. japonica root bark in the treatment of gastroenteric and inflammatory disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
