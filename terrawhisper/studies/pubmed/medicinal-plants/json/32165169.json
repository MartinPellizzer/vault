Modifications applied to the bare GCE formed an excellent biocompatible composite film which was able to selectively detect CHO molecules. Modifications applied to the bare GCE were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (SEM). Under optimal experimental conditions, the sensor was able to detect CHO in the range of 0.1-60 pM and 1-50 pM by EIS and DPV, respectively. Moreover, the sensor showed high sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, low interference and good stability towards CHO determination. Our records confirmed that the sensor was successfully able to the analysis real samples for determination of CHO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
