Recently, herbal medicinal products and, in particular, zerumbone have been widely studied and used for cancer treatment as they induce significant anti-cancer effects. However, there is limited information about the anti-cancer effects of zerumbone in CRC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the <i>in vitro</i> anti-cancer effects of the zerumbone in CRC, focusing on cell apoptosis and migration. Anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects of zerumbone on HT-29 cells were evaluated using MTT and scratch wound healing assay, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of migration and apoptosis-related genes. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by flow cytometry. The intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using a ROS assay kit. Additionally, matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 (MMP-2/-9) activity was determined using gelatin zymography. Zerumbone suppressed the viability of the HT-29 cells dose-dependently while having less cytotoxicity on normal NIH/3T3 cells. Zerumbone induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase. These effects were associated with alteration in the expression of apoptosis-related genes (up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2 genes). Zerumbone also enhanced the generation of ROS in HT-29 cells. Furthermore, zerumbone significantly inhibited the migration of HT-29 cells and decreased MMP-2/-9 mRNA expression and activity. Our findings provide a potential use for zerumbone to induce apoptosis and suppress metastasis in HT-29 cells; thus, it could be developed as a promising natural agent for future CRC therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7201-4178"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 113380Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Memari", "ForeName": "Fezzeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, 196469Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzavi", "ForeName": "Farshad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 113380Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, 196469North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, 37552Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, 113380Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, 113380Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, 113380Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9708436", "ISSNLinking": "1091-5818"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "471-05-6", "NameOfSubstance": "zerumbone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Colorectal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HT29 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Matrix Metalloproteinase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35719111", "10.1177/10915818221104417"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
