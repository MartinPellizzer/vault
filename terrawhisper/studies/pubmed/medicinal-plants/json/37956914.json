It is prevalent worldwide, affecting up to 65 million people, with 80% of cases found in lower-income countries. Medicinal plants are commonly employed for managing and treating epilepsy and convulsions due to their unique therapeutic properties. With increasing research and clinical application, medicinal plants are gaining attention globally due to their potent therapeutic effects and fewer side effects. The development of new plant-based antiepileptic/anticonvulsant agents has become a major focus in the pharmaceutical industry.", "This article summarizes recent research on medicinal plants with reported antiepileptic/anticonvulsant effects. It provides pharmacological and molecular mechanism of action information for the crude extracts and related active constituents evaluated in preclinical research for the treatment of epilepsy and convulsions, and offers a reference for the development of future related studies in this area.", "Articles related to ethnopharmacological and antiepileptic studies on plants or natural products from 2018 to 2023 were collected from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, etc. using keywords related to epilepsy, medicinal plants, and natural products, etc. RESULTS: Eighty plant species are commonly used to treat epilepsy and convulsions in African and Asian countries. Sixty natural products showing potential for antiepileptic/anticonvulsant effects have been identified from these medicinal plants. These products can be broadly classified as alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, terpenoids and other compounds. The antiepileptic action of plant extracts and their active ingredients can be classified according to their abilities to modulate the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems, act as antioxidants, exhibit anti-neuroinflammatory effects, and provide neuroprotection. In addition, we highlight that some medicinal plants capable of pharmacologically relieving epilepsy and cognition may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of refractory epilepsy.", "The review highlights the fact that herbal medicinal products used in traditional medicine are a valuable source of potential candidates for antiepileptic drugs. This confirms and encourages the antiepileptic/anticonvulsant activity of certain medicinal plants, which could serve as inspiration for further development. However, the aspects of structural modification and optimization, metabolism, toxicology, mechanisms, and clinical trials are not fully understood and need to be further explored."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
