Effect of pre-irradiation treatment of up to 10 microg/ml RH-3 was studied in U 87 cells using MTT assay. This study aims at unraveling the mechanism of action of RH-3 in amelioration of radiation-induced cytotoxicity in vitro.", "Most effective doses selected were studied further for the elucidation of radiomodifying properties of RH-3, especially with respect to early and late events of apoptosis.", "RH-3 at concentrations of 7.5 and 10 microg/ml (-15 min) were found most effective in protecting against 2 Gy induced cytotoxicity in terms of MTT reducing ability in U 87 cells. RH-3 was observed to mitigate radiation-induced cellular and mitochondrial free radicals. Mitochondrial membrane potential depletion (studied up to 12 h) was prevented by RH-3 pre-irradiation administration. It could also restore the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 at 24 and 48 h comparable to the control value. RH-3 also prevented radiation-induced increase in mitochondrial mass at 48 and 72 h post-treatment and the values were comparable to that of control cells. Annexin-V-FITC assay at 12 and 24 h time intervals indicated significant protection against radiation-induced apoptosis by RH-3 pre-irradiation treatment.", "Our findings showed that probably RH-3 acts as an antioxidant preventing cellular and mitochondrial free radical generation that could contribute to its ability to inhibit radiation-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Biosciences Division, Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences, Delhi, India. pkagrawal@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Agrawala", "ForeName": "P K", "Initials": "PK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Adhikari", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hippophae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20090102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
