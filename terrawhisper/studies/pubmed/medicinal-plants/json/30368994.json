CHE has widely been used as an analgesic in clinical settings. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of CHE on human cytochrome P450 enzymes. CHE produced time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent inhibition of CYP2D6, with K <sub>I</sub> and k <sub>inact</sub> values of 20.49\u2009\u03bcM and 11.05\u2009min <sup>-1</sup> , respectively. Approximately 76% of CYP2D6 activity was suppressed after 9\u2009minute incubation with CHE (50\u2009\u03bcM). The loss of enzyme activity was not restored following dialysis. The estimated partition ratio of the inactivation was about 156. Quinidine, a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6, attenuated the CHE-mediated enzyme inactivation, while glutathione and catalase/superoxide dismutase did not markedly ameliorate the inhibitory effect. Upon oxidation using potassium ferricyanide, the 15.1% activity of CYP2D6 was restored. These findings indicate that CHE acted as a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP2D6 and the observed effects may induce potential drug-drug interactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yuyang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Tiantian", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8162-6077"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Mingshan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8187-2147"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Liaoning, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Jiang", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "81373471", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "81430086", "Agency": "Program for Innovative Research Team of the Ministry of Education and Program for Liaoning Innovative Research Team in University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Mol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9717231", "ISSNLinking": "1095-6670"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8K7EK8446J", "NameOfSubstance": "chelidonine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenanthridines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30368994", "10.1002/jbt.22251"]}}]}
