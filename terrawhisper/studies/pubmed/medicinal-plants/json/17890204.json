Data were collected from a convenience sample of 365 rural older adults participating in a congregate meals program at a local senior center using a written questionnaire developed for the study. Of the 365 study participants, 39.5% reported using NVNM supplements in the past 12 months. The majority of the participants felt that the NVNM supplements they used were effective, and few reported adverse effects. The majority of the participants felt that NVNM supplements were safe; however, safety concerns were expressed specifically in terms of concurrent use with prescription medication."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health and Nutrition Sciences, Idaho State University, Pocatello, ID, USA. fellcaro@isu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirkpatrick", "ForeName": "Carol F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Page", "ForeName": "Randy M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hayward", "ForeName": "Karen S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Elder", "NlmUniqueID": "8208739", "ISSNLinking": "0163-9366"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Idaho"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17890204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
