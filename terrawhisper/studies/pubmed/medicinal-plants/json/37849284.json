There are many species of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plants, but only a few have been reported to be infected by <i>Meloidogyne</i> species. From 2020 to 2022, a survey was conducted in the Qinling mountain area, which is the main production region of TCM plants in China. Obvious galling symptoms were observed on the root systems of 15 species of TCM plants. Females were collected from diverse diseased TCM plants and subsequently identified at morphological and molecular levels. Among the 20 diseased root samples collected, <i>Meloidogyne hapla</i> populations were identified in 12 samples (60%), and <i>M. incognita</i> populations were identified in eight samples (40%). Among the 15 species of diseased TCM plants, eight species, namely, <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, <i>Leonurus japonicus</i>, <i>Dioscorea zingiberensis</i>, <i>Cornus officinalis</i>, <i>Viola philippica</i>, <i>Achyranthes bidentata</i>, <i>Senecio scandens</i>, and <i>Plantago depressa</i>, were reported to be infected by <i>Meloidogyne</i> species for the first time. The host status of five species of TCM plants for two <i>M. hapla</i> isolates and one <i>M. incognita</i> isolate from TCM plants in this study was then evaluated. Differences in TCM plants' response to nematode infection were apparent when susceptibility was evaluated by the egg counts per gram of fresh root and the reproduction factor of the nematodes. Among the five species of TCM plants tested, <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> and <i>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</i> were the most susceptible, while <i>S. baicalensis</i> and <i>V. philippica</i> were not considered suitable hosts for <i>M. hapla</i> or <i>M. incognita</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Song", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Peiyao", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ankang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Ankang 725021, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhijie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6759-577X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Deliang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xianyang Vocational Technical College, Xi'an 712000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Bo", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7257-276X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Plant Nematology, Bio-Agriculture Institute of Shaanxi, Shaanxi Academy of Sciences, Xi'an 710043, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yingmei", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tylenchoidea"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}], "CoiStatement": "The author(s) declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "40"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37849284", "10.1094/PDIS-01-23-0148-RE"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
