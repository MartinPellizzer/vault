We analyzed the salinity effects on the kinetics of growth, development, and absorption of nutrients of plants cultivated under controlled conditions on a solid organic substrate. Pinus pinea plants were able to tolerate 25 mM NaCl concentration without reduced growth compared to the non-saline control. However, the salt concentration of 50 mM significantly affected the seedling growth after two weeks of treatment. Root growth activity was decreased more than the aerial parts at applied NaCl concentrations. On the other hand, seedlings restricted the transport of Na+ ions to the aerial parts and were strongly selective in favour of K+ ions. The presence of NaCl in the culture medium decreased the absorption rate and the export of K+ and Na+ ions to the aerial parts. This was reflected in the accumulation way of these two ions in the whole plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9454-6295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Biotechnology of Borj-Cedria, Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Hammam-Lif, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ben Ammar", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7063-9350"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Faisal University, College of Sciences, Department of Biological Sciences, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assiut University, Faculty of Science, Botany and Microbiology Department, Assiut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Metwally", "ForeName": "A M A", "Initials": "AMA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3258-8860"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut National de Recherche en G\u00e9nie Rural, Eaux et For\u00eats - INRGREF, Ariana, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Khaldi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Tunis-El-Manar, Campus Universitaire, Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Tunis, D\u00e9partement de Biologie, Tunis, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Zid", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35857942", "10.1590/1519-6984.263214", "S1519-69842024000100361"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
