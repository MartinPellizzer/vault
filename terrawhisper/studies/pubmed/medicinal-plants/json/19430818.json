Under the optimal IAA, IBA and NAA concentration of 1.0, 1.5 and 5.0 mg/l, the maximal mycelial diameter reached 8.6 +/- 0.4, 7.3 +/- 2.6 and 9.0 +/- 1.0 mm, respectively. The mycelial biomass and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production with addition of 5.0 mg/l NAA in a shake flask were 6.24 +/- 0.18 g/l at 168 h and 0.86 +/-0.01 g/l at 192 h, which were enhanced by 15.98 and 56.36% compared to the control, respectively. However, the molecular weight and infrared spectrum of EPS were coincident with the control. Results indicated that NAA at the proper concentration was beneficial in stimulating mycelial growth and EPS biosynthesis, whereas it could not alter the molecular structure of EPS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tian Sheng Road, Beibei, 400715, Chongqing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Bioprocess Biosyst Eng", "NlmUniqueID": "101088505", "ISSNLinking": "1615-7591"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Bioprocess Biosyst Eng. 2009 Aug;32(5):709"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mycelium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides, Bacterial"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19430818", "10.1007/s00449-009-0326-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
