The present study aims to determine the relationship between micro-RNA-143 (miR-143) and C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) and whether it influences the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis (MG). Thymus specimens were resected from patients with thymic hyperplasia combined with MG and then infused into normal mouse cavities to establish MG mouse models. Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, in situ hybridization detection, and Western blot analysis were employed to identify the expression of miR-143 and CXCL13 in MG and normal mice. The obtained thymocytes were cultured in vitro and transfected with a series of miR-143 mimic, miR-143 inhibitor, overexpression of CXCL13, or siRNA against CXCL13. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and flow cytometry assays were employed to assess cell viability, cycle entry, and apoptosis of the thymocytes. Dual-luciferase reporter assay provided verification, confirming that CXCL13 was the target gene of miR-143. Low miR-143 expression in the thymus tissues of the MG mice was detected, which presented with a reciprocal relationship with the expression rate of CLCX13. Observations in relation to the interactions between miR-143 mimic or siRNA-CXCL13 exposure showed reduced cell viability, with a greater number of cells arrested at the G0/G1 phase and a greater rate of induced apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of CXCL13 rescued miR-143 mimic-induced apoptosis. The findings have identified the potential role of miR-143 as a MG development mediator by targeting CXCL13. The key results obtained provide a promising experimental basis for targeted intervention treatment with miR-143."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [],
