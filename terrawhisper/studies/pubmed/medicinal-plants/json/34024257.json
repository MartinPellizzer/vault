The obtained copolymers can self-assemble in aqueous solution into stable block copolymer nanoparticles and random nanoparticles with sizes of 116.1-158.6 and 126.3-187.0\u2009nm, respectively. All nanoparticles showed hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) sensitivity, and the random copolymer nanoparticles presented faster responsiveness to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than did those derived from block copolymers. Berberine (BBR) can be effectively encapsulated into block and random copolymer nanoparticles with loading capacity of 7.6%-9.1% and 7.3%-8.9%, respectively. The BBR release can be controlled in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> medium. For the random copolymer nanoparticles, the release rate of BBR was faster and the cumulative release amounts in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were higher over 48\u2009h. The BBR cumulative release amount in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> medium for the block and random copolymer nanoparticles was 62.2%-70.2% and 68.6%-80.4%, respectively. Moreover, good biocompatibility was observed for the BBR-loaded block and random copolymer nanoparticles. BBR and BBR-loaded nanoparticles can improve Glut4 translocation to the cell membrane and promote glucose transport into cells. BBR-loaded nanoparticles can decrease the blood glucose levels in diabetic rats over 15\u2009days. These results imply that the different chain formulation of block and random copolymers affects the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness and that the two kinds of nanoparticles exhibit potential application as novel vehicles for BBR delivery to regulate blood glucose levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1610-8521"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Province Hospital), Nanjing, Jiangsu, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Honglei", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8373-3530"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Engineering, Guizhou Minzu University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lan", "ForeName": "Tianyu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Xiuhao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yifang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yafei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yujia", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4333-9106"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Xiangchun", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomater Sci Polym Ed", "NlmUniqueID": "9007393", "ISSNLinking": "0920-5063"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "48"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34024257", "10.1080/09205063.2021.1932356"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
