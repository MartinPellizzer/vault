This study aims to explore the effect of ATP on the growth and root quality of Angelica sinensis. To be specific, Mingui 1 was used, and through the pot(soil culture) experiment in the Dao-di producing area, the effects of conventional chemical fertilizer added with ATP on the morphology, photosynthesis, soil respiration, and content of ferulic acid and volatile oil in roots of Mingui 1 were detected. The underlying mechanism was discussed from the perspective of source-sink relationship. The results showed that ATP, via the fertilizer slow-release effect, could meet the needs of A. sinensis for nutrients at the root expansion stage, improve the net photosynthetic rate of leaves and aboveground biomass of plants, and promote the transfer and accumulation of nutrients from the aboveground part(source) to the underground root(sink) in advance during the dry matter accumulation period of roots, so as to improve the root weight per plant. ATP can increase the content of total ferulic acid(the sum of free ferulic acid and coniferyl ferulate), the main effective component of Angelicae Sinensis Radix, by promoting the synthesis of ferulic acid in the roots and the transformation to coniferyl ferulate. However, it had little effect on the content of volatile oil. ATP had certain influence on soil respiration, which needs to be further explored from root activity, rhizosphere microorganisms, and soil microorganisms. This study can lay a basis for soil remediation and improvement and ecological cultivation of A. sinensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China Northwest Chinese and Tibetan Medicine Collaborative Innovation Center Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China Northwest Chinese and Tibetan Medicine Collaborative Innovation Center Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yin-Quan", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Tong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Clay Mineral Applied Research of Gansu Province,Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Zong", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Yang-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Medicine Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shu-Nan", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Magnesium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silicon Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8L70Q75FXE", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AVM951ZWST", "NameOfSubstance": "ferulic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U6V729APAM", "NameOfSubstance": "attapulgite"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Triphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Angelica sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnesium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silicon Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "38"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36046893", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220316.106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
