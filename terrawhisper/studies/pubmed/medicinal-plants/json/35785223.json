Despite the risk of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from food products and food packaging being thought to be very low, it does not exclude possibilities of cross-contamination. This study aimed at assessing that risk based on the population's key food safety Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) that might be considered important to limit eventual virus propagation. A cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey was carried out between June and July 2020 (during the first wave of COVID-19 in the region). This study was targeted at Sub-Saharan Africans aged at least 18, and 817 participants from 5 developing countries (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria) and South Africa (a middle-income country) were recorded. Most of the respondents appeared to be aware of COVID-19, its symptoms, and the protective measures. The awareness of the pandemic led to a reduction in street foods consumption, a rise in the preference for cooked foods, and a greater awareness of hygiene during food preparation and washing of fruits and vegetables before eating. Females appeared to be more knowledgeable on food safety KAP. Globally, higher KAP scores were revealed as the respondents were mature (age, employment, marital status, household, monthly income) and they were able to make responsible choices. Though the risk of the spread of COVID-19 through food contamination appears limited, efforts need to be made to sensitize the public (especially the most exposed communities) about the challenge behind food safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism and Hospitality, College of Business and Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies, 13033, Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tchuenchieu Kamgain", "ForeName": "Alex D", "Initials": "AD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism and Hospitality, College of Business and Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kesa", "ForeName": "Hema", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism and Hospitality, College of Business and Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Onyenweaku", "ForeName": "Eridiong O", "Initials": "EO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Alimi B.A. Risk factors in street food practices in developing countries: a review.
