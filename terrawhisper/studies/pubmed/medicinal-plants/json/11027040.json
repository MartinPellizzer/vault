The weight gain of the rats fed with diets containing raw whole seed and raw cotyledon alone were significantly lower (P = 0.05) than that of the group fed with the reference diet. Processing the cotyledons (dry-autoclaved or roasted) significantly (P < or = 0.05) increased the weight gain of the rats when compared to the weight gain of rats fed diets prepared with raw seed flour. NPU of raw (whole seed 13.8; cotyledon 27.6) was significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) than the reference diet (79.5). The NPU of processed samples was also significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) when (dry-autoclaved 25.1; roasted 25.1) compared to the reference diet fed group (79.5). The BV of the processed samples (dry-autoclaved 31.1; roasted 37.7) was significantly lower (P < or = 0.05) than that of raw (53.6) cotyledon. In contrast TD increased (P < or = 0.05) with processing (dry-autoclaved 80.9; roasted 65.9) when compared to raw cotyledon (51.4). In vitro protein digestibility for the raw whole seed and cotyledon was 71.7 and 70.1% respectively. In vitro starch digestibility of raw and processed cotyledon flour samples indicated dry-autoclaved sample to have the highest digestibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, University of Lund, Sweden."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ekanayake", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jansz", "ForeName": "E R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "B M", "Initials": "BM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11027040", "10.1080/09637480050077176"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
