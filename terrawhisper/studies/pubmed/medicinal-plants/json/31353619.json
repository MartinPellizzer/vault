Although, information on the possible effect of location on the biological activities of S. aethiopicum has not been reported, however, present research work investigated the phenolic contents and distribution, antioxidative properties, and enzyme inhibitory activities of S. aethiopicum collected from two locations in Nigeria. HPLC phenolic profile, polyphenol contents, free radical scavenging activities, and inhibitory effect of eggplant extracts on carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes were carried out. Significant variations were observed in the phenolic profile, polyphenol contents, antioxidant activities, and enzymes inhibitory properties of the extracts from different locations. In most of the analyses carried out, extract of eggplant fruit collected from Uyo (UEF) showed higher activities than the one obtained from Ibadan (IEF). Thus, findings from this study revealed that geographical location may influence the phenolic contents, antioxidant, and enzymes inhibitory properties of eggplant fruits. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The geographical location of a particular place determines the nature and biological activities of plants cultivated in the area. Hence, we presented the effect of location on the phenolic profile, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory properties of eggplant fruit (S. aethiopicum) cultivated in two different locations in Nigeria. However, data generated in this study showed the effect of location on phenolic composition and biological activities of eggplant fruit cultivated in Nigeria."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods and Nutraceutical Unit, Biochemistry Department, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nwanna", "ForeName": "Esther E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7428-0119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods and Nutraceutical Unit, Biochemistry Department, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adebayo", "ForeName": "Adeniyi A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9767-1844"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods and Nutraceutical Unit, Biochemistry Department, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ademosun", "ForeName": "Ayokunle O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5167-9779"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Functional Foods and Nutraceutical Unit, Biochemistry Department, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oboh", "ForeName": "Ganiyu", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Food Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "7706045", "ISSNLinking": "0145-8884"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nigeria"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum melongena"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31353619", "10.1111/jfbc.12797"]}}]}
