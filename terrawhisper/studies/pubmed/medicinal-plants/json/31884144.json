The antioxidant activities of the synthesized compounds were compared with standard antioxidants trolox, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as positive controls, reference antibiotics (doxycycline, dicloxacillin), and medicinal plants (Menthae piperita, Cistus incanus). Chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in conjunction with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-1-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trap were the measurement techniques.", "The results show that the synthesized compounds exhibit weak, albeit a wide spectrum of antiradical and antioxidant activities. The TAS values were measured as trolox equivalents, ranging from 209.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 to 391.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u00a0\u00b5M TE/g; the TAC values were in ranges from 10.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 to 49.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00b5M TE/g being higher than that of dicloxacillin (241.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.5 and 9.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u00b5M TE/g, respectively), but lower than ascorbic acid, BHT, doxycycline, and medicinal plants.
