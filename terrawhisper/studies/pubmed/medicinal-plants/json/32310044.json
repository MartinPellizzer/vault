Thus, optimization of treatment strategies and the introduction of novel therapeutic alternatives for CVD represent key objectives in contemporary biomedical research. In recent years, phytotherapy-defined as the therapeutic use of whole or minimally modified plant components-has ignited large scientific interest, with a resurgence of abundant investigation on a wide array of medicinal herbs (MH) for CVD and other conditions. Numerous MH have been observed to intervene in the pathophysiology of CVD via a myriad of molecular mechanisms, including antiinflammatory, anti-oxidant, and other beneficial properties, which translate into the amelioration of three essential aspects of the pathogenesis of CVD: Dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and hypertension. Although the preclinical data in this scenario is very rich, the true clinical impact of MH and their purported mechanisms of action is less clear, as large-scale robust research in this regard is in relatively early stages and faces important methodological challenges. This review offers a comprehensive look at the most prominent preclinical and clinical evidence currently available concerning the use of MH in the treatment of CVD from a bench-to-bedside approach."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatric Hospital of Maracaibo, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Ch\u00e1vez-Castillo", "ForeName": "Mervin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Ortega", "ForeName": "\u00c1ngel", "Initials": "\u00c1"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Duran", "ForeName": "Pablo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Pirela", "ForeName": "Daniela", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Marquina", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Cano", "ForeName": "Climaco", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, University of Zulia, Maracaibo, Venezuela"}], "LastName": "Salazar", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Barranquilla, Colombia"}], "LastName": "Gonzalez", "ForeName": "Maricarmen C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Barranquilla, Colombia"}], "LastName": "Berm\u00fadez", "ForeName": "Valmore", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Department, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA"}], "LastName": "Rojas-Quintero", "ForeName": "Joselyn", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, School of Medicine Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas,\nVenezuela"}], "LastName": "Velasco", "ForeName": "Manuel", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32310044", "10.2174/1381612826666200420160422", "CPD-EPUB-105938"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
