In this study, we developed a novel and highly efficient pathway for the synthesis of GA and 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introducing efficient cytochrome P450s (CYP450s: Uni25647 and CYP72A63) and pairing their reduction systems from legume plants through transcriptome and genome-wide screening and identification. By increasing the copy number of Uni25647 and pairing cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs) from various plant sources, the titers of 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin and GA were increased to 108.1 \u00b1 4.6mg/L and 18.9 \u00b1 2.0mg/L, which were nearly 1422-fold and 946.5-fold higher, respectively, compared with previously reported data. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest titers reported for GA and 11-oxo-\u03b2-amyrin from S. cerevisiae, indicating an encouraging and promising approach for obtaining increased GA and its related triterpenoids without destroying the licorice plant or the soil ecosystem."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 International Metabolic Engineering Society.
