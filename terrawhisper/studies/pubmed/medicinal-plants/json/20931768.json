After oral administration of ginsenosides Rg1 to rats, ginsenosides Rg1, Rh1, F1 and protopanaxatriol (Ppt) could be detected in plasma. Their Tmax were 0.92, 3.64, 5.17, and 7.30 h, respectively; MRT were 2.68, 5.06, 6.65, and 5.33 h, respectively; AUC(o-t), were 2 363.5, 4 185.5, 3 774.3, and 396.2 ng x mL(-1) x h, respectively. After iv administration of ginsenosides Rg1 to rats, ginsenosides Rg1, Rh1 and FI could be detected in plasma. Their T1/2betaS were 3.12, 5.87, and 6.87 h, respectively; MRTs were 1.92, 5.99, and 7.13 h, respectively; AUCo-tS were 1 454.7, 597.5, and 805.6 ng x mL(-1) x h, respectively. So, it can be concluded that after oral administration, the amounts of metabolites were higher than the prototype in vivo, and the distribution and elimination of the metabolites were relatively slow. After iv administration, the amount of prototype were higher than that of the metabolites in vivo, and the distribution and elimination of the metabolites were relatively slow."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Chang-Jiang", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Ling-Ying", "Initials": "LY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sapogenins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "34080-08-5", "NameOfSubstance": "protopanaxatriol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "53963-43-2", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside F1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63223-86-9", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rh1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PJ788634QY", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsenoside Rg1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax notoginseng"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Sapogenins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20931768"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
