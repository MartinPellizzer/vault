Retrorsine (RTS) or monocrotaline (MCT) was intragastrically administered during pregnancy. The reduction of body and tail lengths was consistent with body weight loss in PA-exposed fetuses, and pathological lesions in liver and lung were observed only in fetuses. Both PAs reduced fetal serum transaminase activities. The GSH/GSSG ratio, GSH peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities also decreased but glutathione S-transferase activity increased in fetal lung, especially for MCT. The pyrrole-protein adducts in fetal liver and lung could be detected, and those adducts in RTS fetal lungs were about 65% of those in MCT group. In conclusion, prenatal PAs exposure induced fetal hepatic and pulmonary toxicities through the generation of pyrrole metabolites and oxidative injury. The difference on fetal pulmonary redox homeostasis between two PAs groups might be associated with the content of PAs migrated to fetal lungs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
