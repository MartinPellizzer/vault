Liposomes have various applications in the field of pharmaceutical and medical field for their drug target potential, diagnostic importance and imaging techniques. Natural plant based drugs and their derivatives have been used in the medicine, nutraceuticals, perfumery, cosmetic and beverages industry. More than half of the prescribed drugs in the worldwide are mainly derived from different natural sources. Development of plant derived product is an emerging field of food, pharmaceutical and health industries. Plants belonging to the Gentianaecae family are well known for their bitter taste and Swertia chirata is one of best plants among them. Various active phytochemical of Swertia chirata are bitter secoiridoids like gentiopicroside, amarogentin, swertiamarin, isovitexin and isogentisin. People use different species of Swertia in the form of decoction, infusion, paste and juice for the treatment of fever and enteric diseases. Swertia chirata possesses anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, hypoglycemic, antihepatotoxic, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Amarogentin, a bitter secoiridoid glycoside present in Swertia chirata plant is an activator of human bitter taste receptor. Pharmacologically, amarogentin has antibacterial, antihepatitis, anticholinergic and chemopreventive activities, moreover, amarogentin has been proven for their anti-lieshmanial activity. Other studies also suggested that amarogentin acts on liver carcinogenesis, skin carcinogenesis and reduced tumour progression. In the present review, we have collected and compiled the data regarding biological sources, ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, anticancer and anti-infective potential of amarogentin. For better understanding of various aspects of amarogentin, we have also discussed Swertia chirayita in a very concise manner. Further data related to various patents on amarogentin have also been discussed in this manuscript. However, we also admit that new advance biological research will also increase the medicinal and pharmacological value of amarogentin. Information regarding the chemistry of amarogentin, its biological sources, bioavailability as a pharmacological agent for the treatment and management of skin disorders and various forms of cancers will be beneficial to the scientists in the medicinal field."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Shalom Institute of Health and Allied Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Allahabad 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Shalom Institute of Health and Allied Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Allahabad 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Shalom Institute of Health and Allied Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Allahabad 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Amita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Shalom Institute of Health and Allied Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Allahabad 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Mahfoozur", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Science, Shalom Institute of Health and Allied Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Allahabad 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Antiinfect Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101266084", "ISSNLinking": "1574-891X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5L82GT5I0W", "NameOfSubstance": "amarogentin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Swertia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30210007", "10.2174/1574891X13666180913154355", "PRI-EPUB-93057"]}}]}
