The capacity of vascular endothelium to release tPA and NO was examined by venous occlusion of the upper arm. Brachial artery diameter was measured at baseline, during post occlusion reactive hyperemia (flow-mediated endothelium-dependent), and after sublingual nitroglycerol administration (endothelium-independent). Vasodilation was expressed as the percentage changes relative to the baseline diameter, while endothelial tPA and NO release was expressed as the percentage change relative to the baseline tPA and NO levels. Thickness of the intima of carotid artery was measured using ultrasound imaging.", "There was no significant difference in eudothelum-independent vasodilation between the controls and diabetes. However, significant reduction in endothelium-dependent vasodilation, endothelial NO release and tPA release (P <0.05, or P <0.01) were found in diabetes compared with the controls and the reduction was lower in diabetes with hypertension than that in diabetes without it. At the same time, there was no difference in intimamedial thickness of the carotid artery between two groups, although the carotid artery in the diabetes without hypertension was much thicker than that in the control. But that in the diabetes with hypertension had significant difference compared with that in the control.", "Danshen Injection may improve the above-mentioned marks. And it may increase the endothelium-dependent vasodilation and endothelial tPA and NO release and improve the vascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The First Hospital, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi'an."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Genquan", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Xiaorui", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.68", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16209274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
