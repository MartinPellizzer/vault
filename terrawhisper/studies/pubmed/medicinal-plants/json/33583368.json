Cardiac fibrosis is one of the most often pathological changes of heart tissues. It occurs as a result of extracellular matrix proteins accumulation at myocardia. Cardiac fibrosis results in impaired cardiac systolic and diastolic functions and is associated with other effects. Therapies with medicines have not been sufficiently successful in treating chronic diseases such as CVD. Therefore, the interest for therapeutic potential of natural compounds and medicinal plants has increased. Plants such as grapes, berries and peanuts contain a polyphenolic compound called \"resveratrol\" which has been reported to have various therapeutic properties for a variety of diseases. Studies on laboratory models show that resveratrol has beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, high blood pressure cardiomyopathy, thrombosis, cardiac fibrosis, and atherosclerosis. In vitro animal models using resveratrol indicated protective effects on the heart by neutralizing reactive oxygen species, preventing inflammation, increasing neoangiogenesis, dilating blood vessels, suppressing apoptosis and delaying atherosclerosis. In this review, we are presenting experimental and clinical results of studies concerning resveratrol effects on cardiac fibrosis as a CVD outcome in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Higher Education Institute of Rab-Rashid, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zivarpour", "ForeName": "Parinaz", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Reiner", "ForeName": "\u017deljko", "Initials": "\u017d"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Research Center for Evidence-Based Health Management, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hallajzadeh", "ForeName": "Jamal", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Ramsar Campus, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirsafaei", "ForeName": "Liaosadat", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Stilbenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q369O8926L", "NameOfSubstance": "Resveratrol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fibrosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Resveratrol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Stilbenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "35"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33583368", "10.2174/1389201022666210212125003", "CPB-EPUB-114167"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
