Despite a variety of synthetic drugs available in the market, the use of herbal medicines for managing diabetes is gaining importance because of being comparatively safer. This article reviews the result of a substantial literature search on polyherbal formulations (PHFs) developed and evaluated with potential for DM. The accumulated data in the literature allowed us to enlist 76PHFs consisting of different parts of 147 plant species belonging to 58 botanical families. The documented plant species are laden with bioactive components with anti-diabetic properties and thus draw attention. The most favoured ingredient for PHFs was leaves of <i>Gymnema sylvestre</i> and seeds of <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> used in 27 and 22 formulations, respectively. Apart from herbs, shilajit (exudates from high mountain rocks) formed an important component of 9 PHFs, whereas calcined <i>Mytilus margaritiferus</i> and goat pancreas were used in Dolabi, the most commonly used tablet form of PHF in Indian markets. The healing properties of PHFs against diabetes have been examined in both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. However, the mechanism(s) of action of PHFs are still unclear and considered the pitfalls inherent in understanding the benefits of PHFs. From the information available based on experimental systems, it could be concluded that plant-derived medicines will have a considerable role to play in the control of diabetes provided the challenges related to their bioavailability, bioefficacy, optimal dose, lack of characterization, ambiguous mechanism of action, and clinical efficiency are addressed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7906-0617"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bodoland University, Kokrajhar-783370, BTR, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Brahma", "ForeName": "Sudem", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3621-4003"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bodoland University, Kokrajhar-783370, BTR, Assam, India."}], "LastName": "Goyal", "ForeName": "Arvind Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1390-7288"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, M.S.
