A new cell line, HCDB-1, has been established from induced carcinomas. The cultured monolayer cells were epithelioid in shape with irregular nuclei. They demonstrated abundant cytokeratin and tonofilaments; however, ultrastructural well-organized desmosomes were lacking. The HCDB-1 cell exhibited population doubling in 19 h and was highly tumorigenic in nude mice. A C-->T transition at codon 141 (Ala to Val) of the p53 gene was detected in this cell. This mutation is equivalent to a specific temperature-sensitive mouse p53Ala135Val mutant that causes transformation by shifting to 37.5 degrees C. HCDB-1 is the first cell line established from the HBP model of oral carcinogenesis induced by DMBA/Taiwanese BQ extract. It might be valuable for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of oral cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Oral Biology and Department of Dentistry, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "K W", "Initials": "KW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chao", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wong", "ForeName": "Y K", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Proc Natl Sci Counc Repub China B", "NlmUniqueID": "8502426", "ISSNLinking": "0255-6596"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Papillary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, p53"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "pathology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10943946"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
