Folate-depleted rats were fed an amino acid-based diet supplemented with 11 different concentrations of folate (227, 272, 317, 363, 408, 454, 499, 544, 590, 635 and 680 nmol/kg) from each of 12 different sources of folate (folic acid, fried beef liver, cooked pinto beans individually, or as 1/3, 1/1, or 3/1 combinations of folate from the folic acid/beans, folic acid/beef liver and beans/beef liver) for a total of 132 treatments. Growth response to folic acid and bean folate was linear, whereas that to beef liver folate was distinctly nonlinear, beef liver folate being more potent at lower dietary concentrations but less potent at higher concentrations compared with folic acid and bean folate. Folic acid and bean folate were equivalent to and exchangeable with one another in promoting growth. Beef liver folate and folic acid/bean folate had an interactive effect in promoting growth. The nature of the interaction was antagonistic in that the presence of folic acid and/or bean folate reduced the efficacy of beef liver folate and vice versa. Beef liver folate is not exchangeable with either folic acid or bean folate. We conclude that food folates generally are not exchangeable and do interact adversely. A statistical interaction model that predicted the growth-promoting effect of several sources of dietary folate was developed and validated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Statistics, University of California, Davis 95616, USA."}], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Facer", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bills", "ForeName": "N D", "Initials": "ND"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Clifford", "ForeName": "A J", "Initials": "AJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "DK-38637", "Acronym": "DK", "Agency": "NIDDK NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "935E97BOY8", "NameOfSubstance": "Folic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Folic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8857521", "10.1093/jn/126.10.2585"]}}]}
