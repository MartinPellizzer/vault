Within the ellagitannins group, agrimoniin--dimeric ellagitannin--is one of the most representative compounds found in many plant materials belonging to the Rosaceae family. Agrimoniin was first isolated in 1982 from roots of Agrimonia pilosa Ledeb. (Rosaceae), a plant traditionally used in Japan and China as an antidiarrheal, hemostatic, and antiparasitic agent. Agrimoniin is a constituent of medicinal plants, which are often applied orally in the form of infusions, decoctions, or tinctures. It is also present in commonly consumed food products, such as strawberries and raspberries. It is metabolized by human gut microbiota into a series of low-molecular-weight urolithins with proven anti-inflammatory and anticancer in vivo and in vitro bioactivities. The compound has received widespread interest owing to some interesting biological effects and therapeutic activities, which we elaborate in the present review. Additionally, we present an overview of the techniques used for the analysis, isolation, and separation of agrimoniin from the practical perspective."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 New York Academy of Sciences."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok, Bia\u0142ystok, Poland."}], "LastName": "Grochowski", "ForeName": "Daniel M", "Initials": "DM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9313-5929"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plant Unit, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Skalicka-Wo\u017aniak", "ForeName": "Krystyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Orhan", "ForeName": "Ilkay Erdogan", "Initials": "IE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Taipa, Macau."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jianbo", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University \"G. d'Annunzio\" of Chieti-Pescara, Chieti, Italy."}], "LastName": "Locatelli", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Piwowarski", "ForeName": "Jakub P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Granica", "ForeName": "Sebastian", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4063-1048"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Bia\u0142ystok, Bia\u0142ystok, Poland."}], "LastName": "Tomczyk", "ForeName": "Micha\u0142", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann N Y Acad Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "7506858", "ISSNLinking": "0077-8923"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "82203-01-8", "NameOfSubstance": "agrimoniin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28731232", "10.1111/nyas.13421"]}}]}
