The sowing time was the most sensitive factor, which affected the single character and the yield per unit of area, whereas the different levels of sowing thickness and fertilizer also remarkably influenced the output. When the seeds were sowed at the mid-April earlier period, drilling with the 20 cm row spacing, they started to emerge about 1 week later, the growth flush period was from June to August, the growth slowed down in September, and the output per hectare could reach to 5.750 kilograms at harvest in late October."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing University of Medical Science, Chongqing 400016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Jun-an", "Initials": "JA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Yong-peng", "Initials": "YP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Zhong-yin", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17048639"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
