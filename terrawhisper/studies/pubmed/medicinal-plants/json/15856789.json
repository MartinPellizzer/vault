We investigated how inter-race differences in resistance of Eucalyptus globulus to a generalist mammalian herbivore, Trichosurus vulpecula, are inherited in their Fl hybrids. We assessed browsing damage of 3-year-old trees in a common environment field trial on four hybrid types of known progeny. The progeny were artificial intra-race crosses and reciprocal inter-race F1 hybrids of two geographically distinct populations (races) of E. globulus north-eastern Tasmania and south-eastern Tasmania. Populations of trees from north-eastern Tasmania are relatively susceptible to browsing by T. vulpecula, while populations from south-eastern Tasmania are more resistant. We assessed the preferences of these trees in a series of paired feeding trials with captive animals to test the field trial results and also investigated the patterns of inheritance of plant secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that the phenotypic expression of resistance of the inter-race Fl hybrids supported the additive pattern of inheritance, as these hybrids were intermediate in resistance compared to the pure parental hybrids. The expression of plant secondary metabolites in the Fl hybrids varied among major groups of individual compounds. The most common pattern supported was dominance towards one of the parental types. Together, condensed tannins and essential oils appeared to explain the observed patterns of resistance among the four hybrid types. While both chemical groups were inherited in a dominant manner in the inter-race Fl hybrids, the direction of dominance was opposite. Their combined concentration, however, was inherited in an additive manner, consistent with the phenotypic differences in browsing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Zoology, CRCfor Sustainable Production Forestry, University of Tasmania Private Bag 5, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, 7001. joreilly@utas.edu.au"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Reilly-Wapstra", "ForeName": "Julianne M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Potts", "ForeName": "Brad M", "Initials": "BM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McArthur", "ForeName": "Clare", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Davies", "ForeName": "Noel W", "Initials": "NW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tilyard", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Chem Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "7505563", "ISSNLinking": "0098-0331"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetics, Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hybridization, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trichosurus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Oecologia. 1994 May;97(4):481-490", "ArticleIdList": ["28313737"]}, {"Citation": "Trends Ecol Evol. 1994 Jun;9(6):209-14", "ArticleIdList": ["21236824"]}, {"Citation": "Evolution. 2000 Dec;54(6):1938-46", "ArticleIdList": ["11209771"]}, {"Citation": "Evolution. 1990 Feb;44(1):104-120", "ArticleIdList": ["28568211"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem Syst Ecol. 2000 Nov 1;28(9):813-824", "ArticleIdList": ["10913843"]}, {"Citation": "Evolution. 1997 Oct;51(5):1435-1444", "ArticleIdList": ["28568624"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 2001 Sep;129(1):87-97", "ArticleIdList": ["28547071"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 1995 Jun;21(6):663-91", "ArticleIdList": ["24234312"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1990 Nov;85(1):92-100", "ArticleIdList": ["28310960"]}, {"Citation": "Phytochem Anal. 2003 Nov-Dec;14(6):360-5", "ArticleIdList": ["14667062"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 2003 Jun;29(6):1447-64", "ArticleIdList": ["12918927"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 2003 May;29(5):1143-58", "ArticleIdList": ["12857027"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1997 Feb;109 (4):571-574", "ArticleIdList": ["28307341"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 2002 Jan;130(2):289-296", "ArticleIdList": ["28547153"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1997 Feb;109 (3):407-413", "ArticleIdList": ["28307538"]}, {"Citation": "J Chem Ecol. 2003 Apr;29(4):881-98", "ArticleIdList": ["12775149"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1996 Oct;108(1):121-129", "ArticleIdList": ["28307742"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Bot. 2000 Dec;87(12):1749-56", "ArticleIdList": ["11118409"]}, {"Citation": "Oecologia. 1996 Jan;105(2):258-265", "ArticleIdList": ["28307091"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15856789", "10.1007/s10886-005-1346-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
