The decoctions of this medical fungus are actively used in folk medicine in many countries and traditional Chinese medicine. From the fungal extract we prepared, only branched \u03b2-glucan had cytotoxic activity among all the water-soluble polysaccharides. This glucan is characterized by a regular structure. Its backbone is formed by 1,3-linked \u03b2-D-Glcp residues, of which every third residue is substituted at O-6 by a single \u03b2-D-Glcp residue. It has a triple helix conformation according to the data obtained from a colorimetric assay with Congo red dye and is characterized by a high-weight average molar mass (Mw\u202f>\u202f800\u202fkDa). \u03b2-Glucan possessed cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f318\u202f\u00b1\u202f47\u202f\u03bcg/mL) and induced the formation of apoptotic bodies around most cancer cells at a concentration of 200\u202f\u03bcg/mL. It should be noted that extraction with boiling water, which is usually used to obtain extracts and decoctions, is unable to isolate active \u03b2-glucan. Active \u03b2-glucan can be obtained in an individual state by cold alkali extraction after dehydration of the fruit bodies and removal of the components extractable by boiling water."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
