The rats were treated by intragastric route (gavage) with P. niruri or vehicle (water) from gestational day 0 to 21. At day 21 of pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, biochemical profile and maternal renal tissue were evaluated. The fetuses and placentas were collected and analyzed.", "Treatment with P. niruri did not alter the reproductive performance outcomes of rats. However, treated 600 group presented with changes in maternal kidney weight and morphology. The plant did not present teratogenic effect, but caused fetal macrosomia and increased ossification sites.", "Treatment with aqueous extract of P. niruri administered during gestation did not cause reproductive toxicity, but led to changes in maternal kidneys and in offspring weight, showing that the leaf extract of this plant can produce detrimental effects during pregnancy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
