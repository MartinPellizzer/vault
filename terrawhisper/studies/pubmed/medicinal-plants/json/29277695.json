Magnolol is a biphenol compound rich in the stem bark of Magnolia officinalis Rehd et Wils., and is able to suppress viral replication in GCRV-infected grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) kidney (CIK) cells in the previous study. In this study, in vivo studies demonstrated that magnolol was efficient to restrain the replication of GCRV and repair the low level of superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity in serum at the non-toxic concentration in vivo. Furthermore, magnolol inhibited CIK cell apoptosis induced by GCRV and kept the normal cellular morphological structure, reflecting in the protection of CIK cells from cell swelling, the formation of apoptotic bodies, the disappearance of cellular morphology and nuclear fragmentation. Reverse transcript quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) showed that magnolol facilitated the expression of apoptosis-inhibiting gene bcl-2, while suppressed the expression of apoptosis-promoting gene bax in GCRV-infected cells. Besides, RT-qPCR and enzyme activity assays proved that magnolol suppressed the expression of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9. Moreover, interactions between magnolol and proteins were predicted by using the STITCH program, which revealed that ten proteins including caspase 3, were involved in the apoptosis pathway, p53 signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Further assays were performed to test the effect of magnolol on apoptosis pathway, which showed that magnolol dramatically inhibited the activity of caspase 3 rather than those of caspase 8 and caspase 9. Collectively, the present study revealed that magnolol heightened the resistance of grass carp against GCRV infection and refrained GCRV-induced apoptosis, which may be attributed to the direct interaction of magnolol with caspase 3. The present results make a contribution to understanding the mechanisms by which small-molecule drugs possess antiviral activities, and lay a foundation for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds in aquaculture industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
