HPLC profile analysis was performed and index compounds of MeOH extracts of aerial parts and EtOAc extracts of subterranean parts were determined. Glycyrrhizin contents and growth rates of the underground parts of some types of Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Glycyrrhiza glabra were compared and four excellent types were selected as candidates for cultivation. One of them was due to Kanzo-Yashiki (Enzan, Yamanashi prefecture), where G. uralensis was cultivated in the Edo period. Alkaloidal constituents of G. uralensis and G. glabra were also investigated and anabasine (an insecticide) and a new tricyclic alkaloid were obtained."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Osaka University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, a 4-20-1, Nasahara, Takatsuki 569-1094, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kusano", "ForeName": "Genjiro", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibano", "ForeName": "Makio", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Watanabe", "ForeName": "Hitoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Kazuo", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}], "NumberOfReferences": "38"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12931658", "10.1248/yakushi.123.619"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
