Those chemical constituents were separated and purified by macroreticular resin, silica gel, Toyopearl HW-40F, SephadexLH-20 and other chromatographic methods, respectively. The chemical structures of new compounds were elucidated by HR-ESI-MS, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, HMQC, HMBC spectrum and specific optical rotations. Compound <b>4</b> was isolated for the first time from the genus <i>Musa</i> and compound <b>7</b> was firstly assigned the carbon spectrum. Furthermore, the cytotoxic activity of compounds 1-9 against WM9, MDA-MB231, HeLa, K562, DU145 and PC3 was screened with cisplatin as a positive control. Compound <b>9</b> showed promising cytotoxic activities with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.65\u2009\u00b1\u20090.38\u2009\u00b5M against the HeLa cell lines, while compound <b>8</b> possessed
