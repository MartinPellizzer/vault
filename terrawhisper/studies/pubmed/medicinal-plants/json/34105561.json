Water-soluble crude polysaccharide (PS50) was obtained from P. sibiricum rhizome. After deproteinization and dialysis, PS50 was isolated and purified via DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-75 gel filtration chromatography to obtain two novel polysaccharides (PSP50-2-1 and PSP50-2-2). Chemical analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies indicated that PSP50-2-1 was composed of \u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u21922)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21922,6)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u03b2-d-Fruf-(2\u2192, and PSP50-2-2 was composed of \u03b2-d-Glcp-(1\u2192, \u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21922)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21926)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u21922,6)-\u03b2-d-Galp-(1\u2192, \u03b2-d-Fruf-(2\u2192. The morphological analysis suggested that PSP50-2-1 and PSP50-2-2 both had a rough surface with cracks. Pharmacological studies showed that PSP50-2-2 at concentrations of 2.59 and 5.19 \u03bcM significantly promoted the differentiation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro, which indicated that PSP50-2-2 had a function of osteogenic activity. Above all, this study provides evidence that PSP50-2-2 may be used as an anti-osteoporotic agent, with applications in health-care and pharmaceutical industries."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Pharmacy of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou 510060, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tianyu", "Initials": "T", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Haiyun", "Initials": "H", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Chunyan", "Initials": "C", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonatum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "48"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34105561", "10.1039/d1fo00938a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
