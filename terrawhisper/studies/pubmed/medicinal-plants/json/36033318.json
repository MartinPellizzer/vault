We studied here Comparative preliminary phytochemical screening test of the ethanol extract and aqueous extract of the stem bark and small branches of <i>Cassia fistula</i> obtained by cold maceration process. Physicochemical analysis of <i>Cassia fistula</i> was done to ascertain the quality of the raw material used in the study. Successive soxhlet extraction method used for the successive extraction of stem bark and small branches with different solvents for comparative chemical profile study by HPLC, LCMS, and GCMS. Molecular Docking Interaction of Abundant Medicinal Phytochemicals in the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Analysis Data of <i>C.\u00a0fistula</i> with the <i>L.\u00a0donovani</i> Drug Target Proteins and Pancreatic lipase colipase target protein.", "The pH of the small branches was found slightly higher as compared to stem bark and the percentage of other parameters like total ash content, acid insoluble ash, loss on drying at 105 \u00b0C, water soluble extractive and alcohol soluble extractive values were found fewer in the small branches as compare to stem bark of the plant. It was observed that the number of peaks in stem bark and small branches of the plant sample were almost similar and the retention time of each peak in stem bark was coincide with the retention of small branches of the sample. Therefore, similarity was observed in stem bark and small branches of the <i>Cassia fistula</i> plant in HPLC, LC-MS and GC-MS. The results obtained from HPLC analysis shows that stem bark contains 0.0084% and small branches having 0.0257% of rhein in <i>Cassia fistula.</i> Compounds 3, 9 and 12 are present in Stem bark as well as small branches of <i>C.\u00a0fistula</i> and Compounds 22, 32 and 37 are present in small branches only. All the compounds have very good binding energy (Kcal/mol) with the respective target proteins.", "The small branches have more active chemical constituents than stem bark against particular target proteins."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Aamkho, Gwalior, 474009, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Ajay Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Captain Srinivasa Murthy Central Ayurveda Research Institute, Chennai, 600106, India."}], "LastName": "Ilavarasan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Captain Srinivasa Murthy Central Ayurveda Research Institute, Chennai, 600106, India."}], "LastName": "Perumal", "ForeName": "Ayyam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Ravindra", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Ayurveda Research Institute, Aamkho, Gwalior, 474009, India."}], "LastName": "Ojha", "ForeName": "Vikas", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Srikanth", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Dhiman", "ForeName": "K S", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Pawar A.V., Patil S.J., Killedar S.G.
