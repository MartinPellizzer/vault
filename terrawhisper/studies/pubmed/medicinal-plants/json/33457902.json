The holoparasitic plant <i>Cistanche tubulosa</i> of Orobanchaceae is an important medicinal resources that are distributed in arid areas. In this study, the complete plastome of <i>C. tubulosa</i> has been sequenced, assembled and analyzed. The total plastome of <i>C. tubulosa</i> was 75,375\u2009bp in length, consisting of a pair of inverted repeats (IRs, 6,593\u2009bp), a large single-copy region (LSC, 32,470\u2009bp) and a small single-copy region (SSC, 29,719\u2009bp). It contained 24 intact protein coding genes, nine pseudogenes, and 44 missing genes. In addition, all the protein-coding genes, which were related to photosynthesis and energy production, were pseudogenised or lost. Four rRNA genes and 24 tRNA genes were intact meanwhile five tRNA genes were missing. Phylogenetic tree indicated that <i>C. tubulosa</i> was closely related to <i>C. phelypaea</i>. Our results may improve understanding of the plastome organization, classification, and evolution of parasitic plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
