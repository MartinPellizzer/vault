In this review, the stimulatory effects of extracts, some fractions and constituents of medicinal plants on \u03b22-adrenoceptors which could be used as possible therapeutic agents in the future were reviewed. Various databases including; Medline, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched using stimulatory effect, \u03b22-adrenoceptors, possible mechanism, tracheal smooth muscle (TSM), medicinal plants and their constituents as keywords from 1985 to 2017. All studied plants including; Nigella sativa, Rosa damascena, Thymus vulgaris, Carum copticom, Carum carvi, Zataria multiflora, Crocus sativus, Cuminum cyminum, Liomnia acidissima, Portulaca oleraceae, Satureja hortensis, Ephedra sinica and Achillea millefolium showed relaxant effect on tracheal smooth muscle with a stimulatory effect on \u03b22-adrenoceptors mechanism. The studied plants and their constituents could be of therapeutic value in clinical practice as a bronchodilatory drug by \u03b22-adrenoceptors stimulatory mechanism for treatment of obstructive pulmonary diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran.
