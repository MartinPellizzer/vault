The MS/MS spectra of the [M + NH4]+ or [M + H]+ ions gave structurally diagnostic fragment ions which revealed information about the taxane skeleton as well as the number and nature of the substituents. The rearranged 11(15-->1)-abeo-taxanes showed a characteristic elimination of the hydroxyisopropyl group with an acetoxy/benzoyloxy group from C-9. The identification of the taxoids was achieved by comparison of the MS/MS spectra with those of authentic taxoids or was based on biogenetic grounds. The results were corroborated by liquid chromatography-MS analysis. Out of the 50 taxoids identified, 21 belonged to the rearranged class. The presence of paclitaxel in the samples from four regions was confirmed: the study also revealed the occurrence of several basic taxoids in these samples. MS/MS profiling by electrospray ionisation was shown to be a fast and reliable technique for the analysis of taxoid samples."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Regional Sophisticated Instrumentation Centre, Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow-226 001, India. kpmadhusudanan@hotmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Madhusudanan", "ForeName": "K P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chattopadhyay", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sashidhara", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Standards"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11899602", "10.1002/pca.610"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
