Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) is identified as one of the oldest herbal plants valued for its nutritional and medicinal properties. This work is mainly designed to evaluate the possible modulatory role of dry coriander fruit extract against gonadal impairments associated with diabetes in female rats and their pups. Twenty-four pregnant rats were divided into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06): group I served as control, group II was administered daily with coriander fruit extract (250\u00a0mg/kg b.wt), group III was injected interaperitoneally with a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) (80\u00a0mg/kg b.wt), and group IV was injected with single dose of STZ and post administered coriander extract. The experiment was conducted from the 4th day of gestation till the end of weaning. At the end of the experiment, the mothers' rats and their offspring were weighed, sacrificed, the ovaries from mothers as well as ovaries and testes from offspring were immediately excised, and processed for histological, immunohistochemical and evaluation of apoptosis and transforming growth factor\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2). Also, blood samples were collected and analyzed to estimate the levels of sex hormones as well as antioxidants.In STZ induced diabetes in mother's rats and their offspring, the ovarian sections revealed severe histopathological signs included several atretic follicles, dilated and congested blood capillaries. Additionally, the testicular sections of offspring appeared with destructive seminiferous tubules. Immunohistochemically, the ovarian sections displayed weak to negative expression for calretinin marker however the testicular sections showed strong expression for Bax protein (apoptotic marker) and weak to negative expression for Ki67 protein (proliferative marker). Also, the mean % values of positively expressed cells for TGF-\u03b2 and annexin-v markers (late and early apoptosis indicator) were significantly elevated in the ovarian and testicular tissues of STZ-induced group of mother's rats and their pups if compared with control. Further results revealed that the levels of insulin, FSH, LH, estrogen, SOD and CAT were significantly decreased if compared with control however the levels of MDA and NO were significantly elevated. Administration of coriander fruit extract to diabetic rats successfully alleviated most of the altered histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and apoptotic changes induced by diabetes. Coriandrum sativum fruit extract has a powerful ameliorative role against STZ-induced diabetic gonadal dysfunctions in female rats and their offspring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
