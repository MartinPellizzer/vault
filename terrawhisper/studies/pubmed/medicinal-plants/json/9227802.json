The attraction of a locally grown molluscicidal plant is based on the development of a philosophy of self-reliance and community involvement. This approach is dependent on community recognition of the infection as a public health problem and their acceptance of proposed control measures. The objectives of this study were: (i) firstly, to assess the knowledge of schistosomiasis in a rural community and their attitude to the use of indigenous plant molluscicides; (ii) secondly, to assess the prevalence and intensity of infection in relation to its severity as perceived within the community. Study sites were located at Mtwalume (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa). Sixty-nine community members were interviewed during six focus-group interviews and two depth interviews. Urine and stool samples (354 and 306, respectively) from children and young adults (2-25 years old) were analysed for Helminth and Protozoal infections. Results indicate that despite a poor understanding of schistosomiasis, it is a primary health concern for those dependent on river-water for their water requirements. Concern for schistosomiasis is indeed matched by a prevalence of 75.14% for Schistosoma haematobium. Oral antischistosomal drugs are inaccessible primarily due to the cost of transport and secondarily, due to the cost of treatment. The concept of molluscicidal control, as an alternative, was enthusiastically received by all respondents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Durban Natural Science Museum, South Africa. tanza@cis.co.za"}], "LastName": "Clark", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Appleton", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kvalsvig", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Acta Trop", "NlmUniqueID": "0370374", "ISSNLinking": "0001-706X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Molluscacides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molluscacides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Parasite Egg Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "prevention & control", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis haematobia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9227802", "10.1016/s0001-706x(97)00672-4", "S0001-706X(97)00672-4"]}}]}
