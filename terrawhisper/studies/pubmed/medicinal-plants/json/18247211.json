However, the term mutilation carries with it powerful negative connotations. In Rwanda, the elongation of the labia minora and the use of botanicals to do so is meant to increase male and female pleasure. Women regard these practices as a positive force in their lives. This paper aims to assess whether Rwandan vaginal practices should indeed be considered a form of female genital mutilation and whether the botanicals used by women are detrimental to their health. Research was carried out in the northeast of Rwanda over the course of 13 months. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirteen informants. Two botanicals applied during stretching sessions were identified as Solanum aculeastrum Dunal and Bidens pilosa L. Both have wide medicinal use and contain demonstrated beneficial bioactive compounds. We suggest that it is therefore more appropriate to describe Rwandan vaginal practices as female genital modification rather than mutilation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Social Sciences, Wageningen University, Netherlands. marian.koster@wur.nl"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Koster", "ForeName": "Marian", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Price", "ForeName": "Lisa Leimar", "Initials": "LL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cult Health Sex", "NlmUniqueID": "100883416", "ISSNLinking": "1369-1058"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Attitude to Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceremonial Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Circumcision, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cultural Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rwanda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Perception"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries"], "DescriptorName": "Vulva"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Women's Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18247211", "10.1080/13691050701775076", "790359449"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
