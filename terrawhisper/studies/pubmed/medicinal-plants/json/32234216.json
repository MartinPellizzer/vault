Besides, plant specialized terpenoids have immense value to humans due to their applications in fragrance, flavor, cosmetic, and biofuel industries. Understanding the fundamental aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of these high-value molecules in plants not only paves the path to enhance plant traits, but also facilitates homologous or heterologous engineering for overproduction of target molecules of importance. Recent developments in functional genomics and high-throughput analytical techniques have led to unraveling of several novel aspects involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of plant specialized terpenoids. The knowledge thus derived has been successfully utilized to produce target specialized terpenoids of plant origin in homologous or heterologous host systems by metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches. Here, we provide an overview and highlights on advances related to the biosynthetic steps, regulation, and metabolic engineering of plant specialized terpenoids."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
