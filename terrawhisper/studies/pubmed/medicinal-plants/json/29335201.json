The analytical results indicated the formation of the complexes in 1:1 or 1:2 (Metal:Ligand) ratio. The geometry around the Cu centers was confirmed to be tetrahedral or octahedral. The cytotoxic activity of the new compounds was evaluated using MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), A2780 (human ovary adenocarcinoma) and HT29 (human colon adenocarcinoma), in addition to MRC5 (normal human fetal lung fibroblast) cells using the MTT cytotoxicity assay. The Schiff base 12c and the Cu complex 13b were the most active in the two series with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.14-2.54\u202f\u03bcM against the three cell lines. Also, the Cu complex 13e showed excellent activity against HT29 with IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f0.05\u03bcM. 7-Cyano-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-6-((3-phenylallylidene) amino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-5-carboxamide (12c) showed high selectivity (6-13 folds) for cancerous cells over normal cells; and it induced marginal increases in the G1 and S phases of MCF-7\u202fcells during cell cycle analysis, while compound 13b increased the MCF-7 Sub-G1 proapoptotic population, and blocked cells in the G2-M phase in a dose dependent manner. The annexin V apoptosis assay revealed the ability of compounds 12c and 13b to increase the early apoptotic MCF-7\u202fcell populations two and three fold, respectively. Furthermore, these findings were supported by data showing that the two compounds (12c and 13b) elicit cytotoxic activity. Taken together, the data presented in this study warrants further in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
