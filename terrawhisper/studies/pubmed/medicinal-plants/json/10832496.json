The ephedra alkaloid content of 20 ephedra-containing supplements was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Contents of (-)-ephedrine, (+)-pseudoephedrine, (-)-methylephedrine, (-)-norephedrine, and (+)-norpseudoephedrine were measured. Ephedra alkaloid content varied considerably among products. Total alkaloid content ranged from 0.0 to 18.5 mg per dosage unit. Ranges for (-)-ephedrine and (+)-pseudoephedrine were 1.1-15.3 mg and 0.2-9.5 mg, respectively. (+)-Norpseudoephedrine, a Schedule IV controlled substance, was often present. Significant lot-to-lot variations in alkaloid content were observed for four products. For one product, lot-to-lot variations in the content of (-)-ephedrine, (+)-pseudoephedrine, and (-)-methylephedrine exceeded 180%, 250%, and 1000%, respectively. Half of the products exhibited discrepancies between the label claim for ephedra alkaloid content and actual alkaloid content in excess of 20%. One product was devoid of ephedra alkaloids. Assay of 20 ephedra-containing dietary supplements showed that alkaloid content often differed markedly from label claims and was inconsistent between two lots of some products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA. gurleybillyj@exchange.uams.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gurley", "ForeName": "B J", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardner", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hubbard", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Am J Health Syst Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "9503023", "ISSNLinking": "1079-2082"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2000 May 15;57(10):951. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/57.10.951", "PMID": "10832494"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Labeling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug and Narcotic Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10832496", "10.1093/ajhp/57.10.963"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
