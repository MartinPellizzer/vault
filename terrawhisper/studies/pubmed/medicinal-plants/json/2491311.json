The results demonstrated that callus was capable of synthesizing saponins, including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, and Rh1. The saponin content (5.33%, D.W.) in the callus was higher than that in intact plants (4.25%, D.W.). Callus also produced a larger amount of sapogenins than intact plants. Callus growth rate was 54.0 mg D.W./liter/day. Callus induced from stems was superior in terms of growth, saponin and sapogenin contents, and saponin composition. MS medium proved optimal for growth of callus induced from stems. The optimum pH was about 5.8 and the optimum temperature about 26 degrees C. Light had little stimulatory effect on callus growth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "G Z", "Initials": "GZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "F Y", "Initials": "FY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chin J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "9100855", "ISSNLinking": "1042-749X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2491311"]}}]}
