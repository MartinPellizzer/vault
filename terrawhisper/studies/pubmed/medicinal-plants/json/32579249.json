In this study, hydrogen bond acceptor (choline chloride, etc.) and hydrogen bond donor (l-malic acid, etc.) were used to prepare different kinds of deep eutectic solvents to extract coumarins from Cortex Fraxini. The extraction conditions, including the composition and moisture content of deep eutectic solvents, extraction time, and liquid-solid ratio, were systematically optimized basing on the extraction yield of coumarins. To further investigate the extraction mechanism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was performed, and the microstructures of Cortex Fraxini powders were observed before and after extraction using scanning electron microscope. Results showed that the novel ultrasound-assisted extraction with conditions of deep eutectic solvent containing betaine/glycerin (1:3), aqueous solution (20%), solid-liquid ratio (15\u00a0mg/mL), and extraction time (30\u00a0min) exhibited the best extraction yields for the four target coumarins and much better extraction efficiency than with conventional solvent extractions. This suggests that the new ultrasound-assisted deep eutectic solvent extraction could be used as a green and high-efficient approach for extraction of the main coumarins from Cortex Fraxini."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
