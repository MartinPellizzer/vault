Weanling rats were fed on purified-casein diets containing active and inactive (autoclaved) field bean (Vicia faba L.) proteinase inhibitors (PI) at levels of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/kg. Diets containing raw- and autoclaved-field-bean meal (FBM) were also given. The body-weight gain, protein efficiency ratio (PER); i.e. the ratio of the live weight gain in g/g of protein consumed and apparent nitrogen digestibility were determined 7, 14 and 21 d after the start of the trial. 2. Significant growth depression (P less than 0.001) was observed in rats given diets containing 2.5 g/kg PI (27--35%). In rats fed on raw FBM growth depression was severe after 7 d (57%). 3. Food intake was depressed at PI inclusion levels of 5 g/kg and higher between 14 and 21 d. 4. PER was depressed significanlty (33-44%) in rats given diets containing the active PI at all levels after 7 d. The protein utilization of all casein diets was higher than that of the FBM diets. 5. Apparent N digestibility was depressed in rats fed on diets containing 10 g/kg PI by 9 and 7% at 14 and 21 d respectively. The N digestibility of both raw and heated FBM was similar at approximately 84%. 6. It was concluded that the PI are not the main factors responsible for the growth depression observed when raw FBM is fed to rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abbey", "ForeName": "B W", "Initials": "BW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neale", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Norton", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depression, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["420757", "10.1079/bjn19790008", "S000711457900009X"]}}]}
