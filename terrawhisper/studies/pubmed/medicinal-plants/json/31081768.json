Unfortunately limited data are available about the toxicity of herbal remedies. Since a popular medicinal plant Holoptelea integrifolia (Roxb) Planch. contains various bioactive molecules, the present study is aimed to assess the histopathological alterations induced by aqueous extract of Holoptelea integrifolia on liver and kidney of wistar albino rat. In this study 60 rats divided in two groups; control and treated with aqueous extract of Holoptelea integrifolia (250mg/kg body weight) for 5 days. Histopathlogical studies by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were done on the liver and kidney tissues at the end of dosing by using standard procedure. Microscopic examination was then carried out to observe any pathological changes in the animals. The result showed that there is no significant variation in the basic architecture of liver and kidney as compared to control male wistar albino rats. In conclusion, aqueous extract of leaves of H. integrifolia may be safe and nontoxic. Further work on pharmacological aspects is required to evaluate the clinical potential of this plant for different ailments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baqai institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baqai Medical University, Pakistan / Dow College of Pharmacy, Dow University of Health Sciences, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yasin", "ForeName": "Hina", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baqai institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baqai Medical University, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mahmud", "ForeName": "Shaukat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rizwani", "ForeName": "Ghazala H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baqai Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baqai Medical University, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Perveen", "ForeName": "Rehana", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baqai Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baqai Medical University, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abrar", "ForeName": "Hina", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baqai Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Baqai Medical University, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Fatima", "ForeName": "Kaneez", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ulmaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081768"]}}]}
