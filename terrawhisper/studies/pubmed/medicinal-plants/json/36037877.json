Curcumin (CUR), a polyphenolic substance isolated from turmeric, is a natural antioxidant. The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether CUR attenuated AA-I-induced renal injury in rats through the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. SD rats were treated with AA-I (10\u00a0mg/kg) or/and CUR (200\u00a0mg/kg) for 28 days to assess the protective effect of CUR on AA-I-induced renal injury in vivo. NRK-52E cells were treated with AA-I (40 \u03bc M) or/and CUR (20 \u03bc M) for 24\u00a0h in vitro. The intervention pathway of CUR against oxidative stress injury induced by AA-I was assessed by observing pathological changes, oxidative stress status, apoptosis and the expression of SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway-related factors. The results showed that AA-I exposure increased the contents of BUN, Cr, KIM-1, NGAL, ALT and AST in serum. It increased the content of MDA, decreased the activities of SOD, GST, GSH and the content of ATP in renal tissue. Pathological changes such as inflammatory cell infiltration and mitochondrial injury occurred in renal tissue. AA-I exposure resulted in a substantial rise in the levels of BAX, Ccaspase-9, Cleaved Caspase-9, Caspase-3, Cleaved Caspase-3 and a significant decrease in mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-2, SIRT1, Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1 and Keap1. However, these changes were reversed by CUR intervention. In summary, AA-I exposure caused mitochondrial dysfunction and triggered apoptosis through the oxidative stress pathway. However, CUR could reduce AA-I-induced renal injury by activating the SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
