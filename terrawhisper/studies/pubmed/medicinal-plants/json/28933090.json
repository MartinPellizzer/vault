To meet the needs in Chinese herbwouls medicine market and clinical application, S. baicalensis has been widely cultivated in Ningxia, Hebei, Shanxi, and Gansu et al. HPLC finger-print and near-infrared were studied in the research to evaluate quality difference of S. baicalensis in four districts. The results showed that the similarity of HPLC finger-print of 12 cultivated S. baicalensis and reference crude herb is more than 0.961, and the other is more than 0.983. On the other hand, paired sample t-test indicated there has no significant difference between the common peaks' area of 12 cultivated S. baicalensis and reference crude herb. It was verified that 12 cultivated S. baicalensis has highly consistency with reference crude herb. On the basis of chromatographic finger-print and near-infrared spectrum, the study applied paired sample t-test to verify analysis results, which could avoid erroneous judgment induced by indefinite threshold values in the similarity of chromatographic finger-print and provide reliable basis for the analysis results. Meanwhile, it also provides a new idea for improving the quality control method of Chinese medicinal materials by comparative study about two comprehensive detection means."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jian-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiao-Juan", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningxia Institute for Drug Control, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ying-Hua", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningxia Institute for Drug Control, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ningxia Research Center of Modern Hui Medicine Engineering and Technology, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Han-Qing", "Initials": "HQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933090", "10.4268/cjcmm20162220"]}}]}
