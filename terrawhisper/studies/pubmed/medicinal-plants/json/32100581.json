Recently, it has been reported to be effective and safe in cancer patients. This case report demonstrates the efficacy of KHMT in a 49-year-old man with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a rare and highly aggressive cancer. The patient showed recurrent pleural effusion and was diagnosed with epithelioid MPM at cT3NxM0 stage III in December 2017. The multidisciplinary care team recommended multimodal treatment based on an extrapleural pneumonectomy, but he refused this because the treatment was aggressive and the effectiveness was unclear. He decided to undergo pemetrexed plus cisplatin chemotherapy if his condition worsened. He visited the Korean Medicine Cancer Center for alternative treatment options. A KHMT regimen, consisting of twice-daily Gunchil-dan and thrice-daily Bangam-tang, was initiated in December 2017. Since commencement of KHMT, computed tomography and X-ray imaging scans have shown no significant interval changes and progression. At 21 months into treatment (September 2019), no significant adverse events have occurred. Given that the median overall survival of patients with MPM is approximately 1 year, the ongoing progression-free survival of this patient for 21 months is relatively long. This case, therefore, suggests that KHMT is a potential treatment option for MPM patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7970-215X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Sung Soo", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Eun Hye", "Initials": "EH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1080-1915"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Jee Young", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Seong Woo", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Integr Cancer Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101128834", "ISSNLinking": "1534-7354"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnostic imaging"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Korean Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesothelioma, Malignant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Progression-Free Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "\nAmerican Cancer Society.
