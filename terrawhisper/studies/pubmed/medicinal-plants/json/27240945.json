We present a strategy by nontargeted metabolomics and \"Commercial-homophyletic\" comparison-induced biomarkers verification with new bioinformatic vehicles, to improve the efficiency and reliability in authentication of herbal medicines. The chemical differentiation of five different parts (root, leaf, flower bud, berry, and seed) of Panax ginseng was illustrated as a case study. First, an optimized ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight-MS(E) (UPLC/QTOF-MS(E)) approach was established for global metabolites profiling. Second, UNIFI\u2122 combined with search of an in-house library was employed to automatically characterize the metabolites. Third, pattern recognition multivariate statistical analysis of the MS(E) data of different parts of commercial and homophyletic samples were separately performed to explore potential biomarkers. Fourth, potential biomarkers deduced from commercial and homophyletic root and leaf samples were cross-compared to infer robust biomarkers. Fifth, discriminating models by artificial neutral network (ANN) were established to identify different parts of P. ginseng. Consequently, 164 compounds were characterized, and 11 robust biomarkers enabling the differentiation among root, leaf, flower bud, and berry, were discovered by removing those structurally unstable and possibly processing-related ones. The ANN models using the robust biomarkers managed to exactly discriminate four different parts and root adulterant with leaf as well. Conclusively, biomarkers verification using homophyletic samples conduces to the discovery of robust biomarkers. The integrated strategy facilitates authentication of herbal medicines in a more efficient and more intelligent manner."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
