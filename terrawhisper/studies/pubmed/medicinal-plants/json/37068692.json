The presence of prickles on stems and leaves is undesirable for them make picking difficult. To date, little is known of prickle formation in Z. armatum. Herein, the morphological and molecular features of prickle initiation in prickless (WC) and three types of prickly Z. armatum were characterized. Compared to WC, the levels of cytokinin and auxin were increased, while GA and JA declined in prickly Z. armatum. Transcriptome analysis identified 6258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prickless and prickly Z. armatum. Among them, several DEGs related to hormone metabolism and signaling, including LOG7, CKX3, AHK1, three DELLAs, six JAZs and TIR1, were candidate genes involved in prickle formation. Transcription factors associated with prickle formation were screened, including MYB6-1/MYB6-2, WER, GL3-2, SPL4/5, SOC1, and SCL32. Of them, MYB6-1 and WER might negatively regulate prickles initiation via interacting with GL3-2. Additionally, the histone acetylation and DNA methylation levels, the transcripts of histone acetyltransferase/deacetylase and DNA methyltransferases showed significant differences between prickless and prickly plants, indicating their involvements in prickle initiation. These findings illustrate the regulation of prickle formation might be mediated by phytohormones (especially cytokinin), transcription factors and epigenetic modifications in Z. armatum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
