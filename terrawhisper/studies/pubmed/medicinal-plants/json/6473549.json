The resultant aqueous suspension was partitioned 3 times with hexane and concentrated under vacuum to achieve the hexane soluble and hexane insoluble fractions. Oral administration of 250 mg/kg of crude ethanolic extract of the whole plant on postcoital days 1-5 prevented pregnancy in about 77% of mated female rats. The hexane soluble fraction inhibited pregnancy in 100% of the rats at a dose of 250 mg/kg and in 50% at 125 mg/kg. In comparison to controls, there was a significant reduction in implantation number at both 125 mg/kg and 625 mg/kg doses. The extract failed to prevent pregnancy in hamsters even at a daily dose of 500 mg/kg on postcoital days 1-5. No contraceptive efficacy of the hexane insoluble extract was observed in rats or hamsters. The extract exhibited potent estrogenic activity at the contraceptive dose, without antiestrogenic activity. A significant uterotrophic effect was seen even at 1/40 of the contraceptive dose. When administered orally for 3 consecutive days, the hexane soluble fraction induced normal implantations at 250 mg/kg and lower doses in adult female mice undergoing experimentally induced delayed implantation. The maximum response in terms of the percentage of pregnant animals and the average number of implantations was observed at 125 mg/kg dose. The experimental results confirm the frank estrogenicity of the extract."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["030004", "00147882"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: PLANTA MEDICA."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Asia", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Fertility Control, Postcoital", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Southern Asia", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6473549", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1984", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0032-0943", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "50", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1984", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "Planta medica", "ISOAbbreviation": "Planta Med"}, "ArticleTitle": "Postcoital contraceptive efficacy and hormonal profile of Lepidium capitatum.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "154", "EndPage": "157", "MedlinePgn": "154-7"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wadhwa", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pal", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khanna", "ForeName": "N M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamboj", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "423D2T571U", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Implantation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethinyl Estradiol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6473549", "10.1055/s-2007-969658"]}}]}
