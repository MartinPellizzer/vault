Heart failure (HF), as the terminal stage of many cardiovascular diseases, has brought a heavy burden to the global medical system. Microvascular rarefaction (decreased myocardial capillary density) with reduced coronary flow reserve is a hallmark of HF and therapeutic myocardial angiogenesis is now emerging as a promising approach for the prevention and treatment in HF. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has made remarkable achievements in the treatment of many cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence have shown that their protective effect in HF is closely related to therapeutic angiogenesis.", "This review is to enlighten the therapeutic effect and pro-angiogenic mechanism of TCM in HF, and provide valuable hints for the development of pro-angiogenic drugs for the treatment of HF.", "The relevant information about cardioprotective TCM was collected from electronic scientific databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).", "The studies showed that TCM formulas, extracts, and compounds from herbal medicines can provide therapeutic effect in HF with their pro-angiogenic activity. Their actions are achieved mainly by regulating the key angiogenesis factors particularly VEGF, as well as related regulators including signal molecules and pathways, non-coding miRNAs and stem cells.", "TCM and their active components might be promising in therapeutic angiogenesis for the treatment of HF."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
