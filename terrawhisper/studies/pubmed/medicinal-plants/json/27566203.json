(Phyllanthaceae) are used in Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Arabic, Tibetan and various other folk medicinal systems to promote intelligence and memory. Recent study from our lab indicated the neuroprotective effect of tannoids principles of Emblica officinalis (EoT) against memory loss caused by aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) intoxication through attenuating acetylcholine esterase activity and the expression of amyloid \u03b2 protein biosynthesis related markers. However the molecular mechanism of EoT has not yet been fully elucidated.", "The aim of the present study was to further investigate the neuroprotective mechanisms of EoT against AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced cognitive deficits, tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.", "Rats were treated with AlCl<sub>3</sub> for 60 days to induce biochemical and physiological abnormalities similar to AD patients. AD rats were treated with EoT (100mg/kg., bw. oral) for 60 days. For the examination of neuroprotective effect of EoT, behavior analysis, biochemical estimations and western blot were performed in the hippocampus and cortex of control, EoT treated and untreated AD rats.", "Intraperitoneal injections of AlCl<sub>3</sub> (100mg/kg., b.w.) for 60 days enhanced the learning and memory deficits, levels of TBARS and diminished the levels of reduced glutathione and activities of enzymatic antioxidants as compared to control group. Moreover toxicity of AlCl<sub>3</sub> is accompanied by the enhanced expressions of Bax, caspases-3,-9, cytosolic cytochrome c (cyto c), and pTau along with diminished expressions of Bcl-2, mitochondrial cyto c, pGSK-3\u03b2 and pAkt. Coadministration of EoT nullified the cognitive deficits, biochemical abnormalities and apoptosis induced by AlCl<sub>3</sub> treatment. Moreover EoT prevents tau hyperphosphorylation by targeting the GSK-3\u03b2/Akt signaling pathway.", "This study confirms that EoT would be used as a potential drug candidate for AD and other tau pathology-related neuronal degenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
