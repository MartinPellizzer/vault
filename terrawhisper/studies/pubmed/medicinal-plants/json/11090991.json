Its behavioural effects are still not scientifically investigated; therefore, our preliminary study aim is to evaluate the influence of this phyto-drug on rats spontaneous behaviour. High quality P. notoginseng root dry extract has been orally administered through gastric tube for 10 days in two doses (43 and 86 mg/kg in a volume of 5 ml/kg per day) and its effects on locomotion, emotional reactivity and nutrition have been evaluated in different groups of Wistar rats (ten per group) versus animals treated with 5 ml/kg per day of saline. Actimeter test, open field test and microstructural analysis of unconditioned behaviour were carried out. The data were processed by ANOVA-test followed by the Student's one-tail t-test and a 0.05 significance level was chosen for all statistical tests. A significant increase in spontaneous motility being not associated to an increase in grooming episodes duration and number was found in all tests (P<0.05). Feeding behaviour appeared not to be affected by the treatment. Observed effects did not seem dose-related. Reduction of grooming episodes duration and number and increase of inner crossings in open field suggested that notoginsenoides can modulate emotional responses in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biomedical Sciences Department, Pharmacology Section, University of Modena and Reggio nell'Emilia, Via Campi, 287, 41100, Modena, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cicero", "ForeName": "A F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bandieri", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Arletti", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11090991", "10.1016/s0378-8741(00)00277-4", "S0378874100002774"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
