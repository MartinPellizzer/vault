Nowadays medicinal plants are gaining more attention in drug discovery and approximately 70% of anticancer drugs were developed from natural products or plants. A strong candidate from medicinal plant with anticancer potential should have four major properties: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, and cytotoxic activities.", "In order to assess Togolese traditional healer's claims about the anticancer potential of medicinal plants and obtain candidate plants for anticancer drug discovery, some species were selected from surveys and evaluated for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic activities.", "Four species, Cochlospermum planchonii (CP), Piliostigma thonningii (PT), Paullinia pinnata (PP), and Securidaca longipedunculata (SL) were selected and analyzed to detect the phytochemical components. The mentioned bioactivities were evaluated using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo assays.", "Relative to SL extract, CP and PT have shown significantly high polyphenols and flavonoids content. The DPPH, FRAP, and TAC of the extracts revealed that CP, PT, and PP have a potent antioxidant effect compared to SL. MDA analysis revealed the same antioxidant activity as CP, PT and PP showed a minor MDA level. The egg albumin denaturation assay showed that IC50 of CP and PP was significantly higher than control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast, the Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) results showed a nonsignificant effect (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Notably, SL extract was nonsignificant to control in both Egg Albumin and BSA. Furthermore, angiogenesis assay showed that SL at 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and PP at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml effectively reduced the number of blood vessels than control and showed a potent anti-angiogenic effect (2.7-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No cytotoxicity on PBMC was reported for CP, PP, and PT up to 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, whereas SL at 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/ml exhibit benign cytotoxicity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).", "This study provided in vitro evidence supporting further evaluation on cancer cell lines and tumors in vivo."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
