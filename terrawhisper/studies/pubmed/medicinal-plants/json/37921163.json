Conventional medications such as use of aspirin, beta-blockers, statins and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors involve use of drugs with many antagonistic effects. Hence, alternative therapies which are safe, effective, and relatively cheap are increasingly being investigated for the treatment and prevention of CVDs. The secondary metabolites of medicinal plants contain several bioactive compounds which have emerged as alternatives to toxic modern medicines. The detrimental effects of CVDs can be mitigated via the use of various bioactive phytochemicals such as catechin, isoflavones, quercetin etc. present in medicinal plants. Current review intends to accumulate previously published data over the years using online databases concerning herbal plant based secondary metabolites that can help in inhibition and treatment of CVDs. An in-depth review of various phytochemical constituents with therapeutic actions such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasorelaxant, anti-hypertensive and cardioprotective properties has been delineated. An attempt has been made to provide a probable mechanistic overview for the pertinent phytoconstituent which will help in achieving a better prognosis and effective treatment for CVDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Grewal", "ForeName": "Jyotika", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5413-2856"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Vijay", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Gandhi", "ForeName": "Yashika", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Rawat", "ForeName": "Hemant", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Ravindra", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Arjun", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Narasimhaji", "ForeName": "Ch V", "Initials": "CV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi, 110058, India."}], "LastName": "Acharya", "ForeName": "Rabinarayan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5075-6047"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Ayurveda Research Institute Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, 284003, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Sujeet K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269160", "ISSNLinking": "1871-529X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37921163", "10.2174/011871529X262371231009132426", "CHDDT-EPUB-135561"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
