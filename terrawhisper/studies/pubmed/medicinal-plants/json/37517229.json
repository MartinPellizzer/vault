Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key target of cardiovascular diseases. Despite its significance, there is limited scientific investigation regarding the ACE inhibitory effects of licorice. In this study, we used an activity-guided approach with an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probe to identify compounds with ACE-inhibitory activity in licorice. Nine components of licorice were found to have ACE inhibitory activity, in which 46 compounds were identified by using UPLC-QTOF-MS. Seven active compounds were found in this study. Among them, licochalcone B had best ACE inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.24\u00a0\u03bcM). Finally, an UPLC-Q-MS method was established to quantify the five major active compounds in three batches of licorice. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the potential of licorice as a source of ACE inhibitors and its relevance in the development of related products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
