Candidates were primarily screened using the disk-agar method for antibacterial activity against three different Salmonella serotypes. Of the herbs tested, the aqueous and methanolic extracts of Schizandrae Fructus exhibited antibacterial activity against all three Salmonella. The extracts of this herb were further tested against 13 additional Salmonella strains of 6 different serotypes. All of these strains were also affected by these extracts, though the methanolic extract had slightly higher activity. The MIC values of this extract against the 16 Salmonella strains varied from 15.6 to 125 microg/ml. Nine of the 16 strains tested had MIC values of <31.3 microg/ml for the methanolic extract of Schizandrae Fructus. The in vivo antibacterial activity of Schizandrae Fructus extract was examined in a S. Typhimurium infection mouse model. Mice were initially infected with S. Typhimurium, and then administered with Schizandrae Fructus extract. The extract was found to have major effects on mortality and on the numbers of viable S. Typhimurium recovered from feces. Clinical signs and histological damages were rarely observed in the treated mice, whereas the untreated controls showed clinical signs, e.g., lethargy, and histological damage in the kidney, liver, intestine, and spleen. We conclude that Schizandrae Fructus has the potential to provide an effective treatment for salmonellosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Veterinary Medicine and Bio-Safety Research Institute, Chonbuk National University, Chonju, 561-756, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Mi-Hyang", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Hyun Ae", "Initials": "HA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Dong-Yeul", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hyun", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sohn", "ForeName": "Dong-Hwan", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Youn-Chul", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eo", "ForeName": "Seong-Kug", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Ho-Young", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sam-Woong", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "John Hwa", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8412849", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Assay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella Food Poisoning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16876280", "10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2006.06.004", "S0168-1605(06)00307-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
