There were no differences between the two biotypes with regard to absorption and translocation of the herbicide. Three days after treatment, approximately 90, 5, and 2% of the applied [(14)C]ethametsulfuron-methyl was found in the treated leaf, foliage, and roots of each biotype, respectively. Acetolactate synthase extracted from the two biotypes was equally sensitive to both ethametsulfuron-methyl and chlorsulfuron. These results indicate that resistance was not due to differences in the target site, absorption, or translocation. However, ethametsulfuron-methyl was metabolized more rapidly in the R than the S biotype. Approximately 82, 73, 42, 30, and 17% of the recovered radioactivity remained as ethametsulfuron-methyl in R wild mustard 3, 6, 18, 48, and 72 h after treatment, respectively. Conversely, 84, 79, 85, and 73% of the (14)C was ethametsulfuron-methyl in the S biotype 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment, respectively. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that resistance is due to enhanced metabolism of ethametsulfuron-methyl in the R biotype."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G 2W1."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Veldhuis", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "L M", "Initials": "LM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "O'Donovan", "ForeName": "J T", "Initials": "JT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dyer", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hall", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triazines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97780-06-8", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl 2-(((((4-ethoxy-6-(methylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino)carbonyl)amino)sulfonyl)benzoate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Triazines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10898653", "10.1021/jf990752g", "jf990752g"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
