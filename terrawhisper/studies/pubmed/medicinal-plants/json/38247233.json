The current study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of 150 phytocompounds of North Western Himalayas medicinal plants by molecular docking. Two target proteins of hemagglutinin of influenza virus A (PDB ID 4WE8) and Influenza virus H3N2 nucleoprotein - R416A mutant (PDB ID 7NT8) are selected for this study. Molecular docking was done by AutoDock vina tool, toxicity and drug-likeness prediction was done by protox II and Moleinspiration. MD simulation of best protein-ligand complexes was done by using Gromacs, version 2021.5. Molecular docking and toxicity data revealed that clicoemodin and rumexocide showed the best binding with both target proteins 4WEB & 7NT8. Clicoemodin showed the -7.5\u2009KJ/mol binding energy with 4WE8 and 7NT8. Similarly, rumexoside showed the -7.6\u2009KJ/mol binding energy with 4WE8 and -7.6\u2009KJ/mol with 7NT8. Furthermore, Molecular dynamic simulation and MMPBSA binding free energy validated the stability of protein-ligand complexes. The current study suggested that clicoemodin and rumexocide are the promising inhibitors of H3N2 proteins hemagglutinin of influenza virus A and Influenza virus H3N2 nucleoprotein - R416A mutant, though there is further <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> validation is required.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
