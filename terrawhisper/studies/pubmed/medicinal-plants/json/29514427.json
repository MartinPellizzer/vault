The objective of the present study was to assess the impact of lifestyle factors on age-related differences in hair trace element content in pregnant women in the third trimester.", "A total of 124 pregnant women aged 20&ndash;29 (n = 72) and 30&ndash;39 (n = 52) were ex- amined. Scalp hair trace element content was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry at NexION 300D (Perkin Elmer, USA) after microwave digestion.", "The results showed that the elder pregnant women had 36% (p = 0.009), 14% (p = 0.045), and 45% (p = 0.044) lower hair Zn, V, and Cd content, and 16% (p = 0.044) higher hair B levels &ndash; in comparison to the respective younger group values. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the age of the women had a significant influence on hair V and Zn levels. B content was also significantly influenced by age at first intercourse, smoking status, and specific dietary habits. None of the lifestyle factors were associated with hair Cd content in pregnant women. Hair V levels were also affected by following a special diet. Interestingly, alcohol intake did not have a significant impact on hair trace element content.", "These data indicate that lifestyle factors have a significant influence on age-related changes in hair trace elements during pregnancy that may impact the outcome of pregnancy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioelementology, Orenburg State University, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Bioelementology, Yaroslavl State University, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peoples?
