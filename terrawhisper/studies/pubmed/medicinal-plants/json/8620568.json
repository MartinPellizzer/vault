The structures of these compounds were determined by analysis of their spectroscopic data. The presence of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group in 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin suggested that the cytotoxic potential of this compound could be mediated through reaction with cellular nucleophiles by means of a Michael-type addition. The compound 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin reacted with the nucleophiles L-cysteine and beta-mercaptoethanol. The adduct with beta-mercaptoethanol was isolated, structurally characterized and found to be approximately 5-fold less cytotoxic than 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin itself. The compound 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin did not interact with DNA nor guanosine, and it was not mutagenic for Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677. The effects of 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin on the growth of human cancer cells were analyzed utilizing cultured ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells. Biosynthesis of DNA, RNA and protein was reduced in treated cells, and accumulation at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle was observed. The compound 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin did not mediate antimitotic activity with dibutyryl cAMP-treated cultured astrocytoma cells, suggesting that the cell cycle effect is G2 specific. No antitumor activity was observed when athymic mice carrying KB cells were treated with 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin. These data indicate that the cytotoxic activity of 13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin is mediated in part by covalent reaction with a cellular component (such as sulfhydryl-containing protein) by means of a Michael-type addition, and this results in the blockage of cell-cycle progression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois at Chicago 60612, USA."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shamon", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "H B", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chagwedera", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Besterman", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Farnsworth", "ForeName": "N R", "Initials": "NR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cordell", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pezzuto", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kinghorn", "ForeName": "A D", "Initials": "AD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01-CA-52956", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biol Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "0227276", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2797"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "13-hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "13-methoxy-15-oxozoapatlin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G2 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mercaptoethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrum Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8620568", "10.1016/0009-2797(95)03669-5", "0009-2797(95)03669-5"]}}]}
