The DNA of 13 herb samples including C. boweri and M. horridula from Lhasa of Tibet was extracted, ITS PCR were amplified and sequenced. Both assembled and web downloaded 71 ITS2 sequences were removed of 5. 8S and 28S. Multiple sequence alignment was completed and the intraspecific and interspecific genetic distances were calculated by MEGA 5.0, while the neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed. We also predicted the ITS2 secondary structure of C. boweri, M. horridula and their close related species. The results showed that ITS2 as DNA barcode was able to identify C. boweri, M. horridula as well as well as their close related species effectively. The established based on ITS2 barcode method provides the regular and safe detection technology for identification of C. boweri, M. horridula and their close related species, adulterants and counterfeits, in order to ensure their quality control, safe medication, reasonable development and utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dou", "ForeName": "Rong-kun", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Zhen-fei", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Rui-xue", "Initials": "RX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Yao-yao", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Liang-ke", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Di-qiang", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Can-quan", "Initials": "CQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Corydalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal Spacer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Papaveraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26281578"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
