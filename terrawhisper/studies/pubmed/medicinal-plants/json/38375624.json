The progression of gynecologic cancer is linked to various molecular mechanisms. Historically, cancer research primarily focused on protein-coding genes. However, recent years have unveiled the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), and circular RNAs, in modulating cellular functions within gynecological cancer. Substantial evidence suggests that ncRNAs may wield a dual role in gynecological cancer, acting as either oncogenic or tumor-suppressive agents. Numerous clinical trials are presently investigating the roles of ncRNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. These endeavors may introduce a fresh perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological cancer. In this overview, we highlight some of the ncRNAs associated with gynecological cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
