We examined genetic diversity and the extent of clonality in four populations of the monotypic herbaceous perennial Japonolirion osense, which is one of the most rare flowering plants in Japan. Allozyme analysis revealed moderate levels of genetic variation, and the proportion of polymorphic loci (P=66.7%) was higher than the value for species with similar life-history traits. With four polymorphic loci, 19 multilocus genotypes were observed among 433 aerial shoot samples and 10 (52%) were found only in single populations. The proportion of distinguishable genotypes (PD=0.10) and Simpson's index of diversity (D=0.52) also exhibited moderate levels of genotypic diversity compared to other clonal plants, with genotype frequencies at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The distributions of genotypes were often localized and they were mostly found within a radius of 5 m. Spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that shoot samples located 4 m apart were expected to be genetically independent. The results suggest that the spatial extent of genets was relatively narrow and thus the clonality was not extensive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Ecology and Genetics, Graduate School of Environmental Earth Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0810, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tomimatsu", "ForeName": "Hiroshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoya", "ForeName": "Akihiko", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "Hideki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohara", "ForeName": "Masashi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Plant Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9887853", "ISSNLinking": "0918-9440"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diploidy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geography"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Evolution. 2001 Aug;55(8):1560-8", "ArticleIdList": ["11580015"]}, {"Citation": "Heredity (Edinb). 1999 May;82 ( Pt 5):561-73", "ArticleIdList": ["10383677"]}, {"Citation": "Am J Bot. 2000 Jun;87(6):783-92", "ArticleIdList": ["10860909"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Ecol. 2002 Oct;11(10):2137-50", "ArticleIdList": ["12296955"]}, {"Citation": "Evolution. 1984 Nov;38(6):1358-1370", "ArticleIdList": ["28563791"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15002490", "10.1007/s10265-003-0121-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
