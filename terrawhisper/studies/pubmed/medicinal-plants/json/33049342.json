In addition, various species are currently recognized as sources of metabolites with pharmacological, cosmetical and nutraceutical interest. Nevertheless, ethnoveterinary data on salt-tolerant plants are dispersed in the literature and there are few discussions on its veterinary potential. Having in mind the rising interest on organic farming, alternatives to chemical substances in livestock production and concern for animal health and welfare practices, these plants may represent an untapped resource for animal management and veterinary purposes. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to summarize the ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant plants described in the Mediterranean region, raising awareness to the potential of this group of plants to be used in veterinary science, targeting especially ruminants.", "Literature search (2000-2020) was conducted using Web of Science and Science Direct databases. Ethnoveterinary reports (EVR) concerning salt-tolerant plants were summarized and filtered for ruminants. From the final 29 publications, EVR concerning therapeutic uses were categorized according to its ATCvet code and results analyzed.", "A total of 221 EVR were identified from 39 plants, belonging to 21 plant families, targetting ruminants. Ten EVR (4.5%) concerned uses of salt-tolerant species as animal feed, while around 75% of therapeutic uses was represented by three categories: alimentary tract and metabolism (QA; n\u00a0=\u00a075), dermatologicals (QD; n\u00a0=\u00a053) and genitourinary system and sex hormones (QG; n\u00a0=\u00a041). Pistacia lentiscus L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter, Plantago major L. and Hordeum vulgare L. were the most cited species in the latter categories.", "The ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant species hints some plants of veterinary pharmacological potential, but other species deserve further notice. This information should serve as a basis and, coupled with the currently available scientific data on bioactive properties and chemical composition of salt-tolerant species, inspire additional research on the exploitation of this botanical group, as sources of novel products for ruminant nutrition, health and quality of its products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
