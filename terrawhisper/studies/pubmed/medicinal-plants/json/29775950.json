Their structures were determined by HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, ECD, and X-ray single crystal diffraction analyses as well as quantum chemical calculation. The abosulte configuration of terpendole A (2) was determined for the first time. Compound 1 displayed the significant agonistic effect on pregnane X receptor (PXR) with EC<sub>50</sub> value of 134.91\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.01\u202fnM, and its interaction with PXR was investigated by molecular docking.
