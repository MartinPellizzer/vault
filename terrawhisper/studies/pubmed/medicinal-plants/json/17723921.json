This is particularly the case for the crude herbals that are commonly formulated as a mixture, so that their ingredients may be ambiguous and even contain harmful contaminants. Presented here is an overview of the more commonly recognized herbal products that have been reported to be associated with liver injury. Although many of them are clearly implicated, there are some, particularly those identified solely through an occasional case report, for which the relationship is uncertain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 31 Center Drive, Room 9A27, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. seeffl@extra.niddk.nih.gov"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Seeff", "ForeName": "Leonard B", "Initials": "LB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Liver Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9710002", "ISSNLinking": "1089-3261"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "122"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17723921", "10.1016/j.cld.2007.06.005", "S1089-3261(07)00048-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
