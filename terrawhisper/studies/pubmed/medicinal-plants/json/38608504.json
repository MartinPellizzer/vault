Two factors were considered for the factorial experiment: AMF with four levels (non-inoculated plants, Funneliformis mosseae, Rhizophagus intraradices and the combination of both), and chitosan with six levels (0, 50, 100, 200, 400\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> and 1% acetic acid). Four months after treatments, the aerial part and root length, the levels of lipid peroxidation, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity, total phenol and flavonoid contents and the main secondary metabolites (rosmarinic acid and quercetin) in the leaves and roots were determined. The flowering stage was observed in R. intraradices treatments and the highest percentage of colonization (78.87%) was observed in the treatment of F. mosseae\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0400\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> chitosan. Furthermore, simultaneous application of chitosan and AMF were more effective than their separate application to induce phenolic compounds accumulation, PAL activity and reduce oxidative compounds. The cluster and principal component analysis based on the measured variables indicated that the treatments could be classified into three clusters. It seems that different treatments in different tissues have different effects. However, in an overview, it can be concluded that 400\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> chitosan and F. mosseae\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0R. intraradices showed better results in single and simultaneous applications. The results of this research can be considered in the optimization of this medicinal plant under normal conditions and experiments related to abiotic stresses in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.
