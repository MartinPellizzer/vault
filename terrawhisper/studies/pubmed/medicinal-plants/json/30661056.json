Methods Dental patients attending the female section of Taibah University Dental Hospital were invited to complete an online questionnaire which explored demographic data, and pattern of NRU for oral diseases. Results A total of 540 patients participated in the survey. A total of 232 patients (43%) used natural remedies to treat oral diseases. The most commonly cited reasons for NRU were financial reasons (n=79, 34.1%). The practice had a statistically significant association with older participants (p=0.003), and those working as employees (p=0.031). Most of the natural remedies used (n=17) were herbal, with cloves (71.1%) and miswak (26.7%) being the most frequently reported. Acute dental pain (n=157, 67.7%) and halitosis (n= 51, 22%) were the most frequently cited oral conditions associated with NRU. A percentage of 87.1% of patients using natural remedies (n=202) perceived improvement of symptoms upon use of natural remedies, however, 2.2% (n=5) reported complications. Conclusions Substantial proportion of patients use natural remedies to treat their oral disease. Patients were mostly satisfied with natural remedies in terms of effectiveness and lack of complications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Dentistry, Taibah University, Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Dar-Odeh", "ForeName": "Najla S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Dentistry, Taibah University, Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Gasim", "ForeName": "Rafal A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Dentistry, Taibah University, Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Binsaad", "ForeName": "Sara M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Abu-Hammad", "ForeName": "Shaden", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Dentistry, Taibah University, Al Madinah Al Munawarah, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dentistry, University of Jordan, Amman, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Abu-Hammad", "ForeName": "Osama A", "Initials": "OA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30661056", "10.1515/jcim-2018-0032", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2018-0032/jcim-2018-0032.xml"]}}]}
