The ABe was partitioned with water and butanol to yield a butanol-soluble fraction (BuF) and a water-soluble fraction (AF). The AF was further partitioned with ethyl acetate and hexane to obtain ethyl acetate (EF) and hexane (HF) soluble fractions. The hypoglycemic property of each fraction was assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at a dose of 125-mg/kg-body weight in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats (STZ 60 mg/kg i.p.). Fractions AF, BuF and the reference drug metformin (500 mg/kg body weight), produced significant blood glucose-lowering effect in the diabetic rats when compared to the vehicle (distilled water). In the long-term study, the diabetic rats were randomly divided into 4 groups and treated orally by gavage with vehicle, AF (125 mg/kg body weight), BuF (125 mg/kg body weight), and metformin (500 mg/kg body weight) respectively twice a day for 14 days. On day 7 and day 14, AF and BuF, like the reference drug, metformin, lowered the fasting blood glucose concentration significantly (P < 0.05) when compared with the vehicle. The serum insulin level was significantly increased in the AF-treated rats only on day 14 when compared to that in the vehicle-treated rats on day zero (P < 0.05). The serum insulin level in BuF-treated rats was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) on both day 7 and day 14 compared to that on day zero. Hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase activity was significantly lower (P<0.05) in AF- and metformin-treated groups, but not in BuF-treated groups, compared to that in vehicle-treated group. However, there was no change in hepatic glycogen content in AF-, BuF- and metformin-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group. These results indicate that AF is more potent than BuF in the amelioration of hyperglycemia in STZ-diabetic rats and is a potential source for the isolation of new orally active agent(s) for anti-diabetic therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pushparaj", "ForeName": "P N", "Initials": "PN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "B K", "Initials": "BK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375521", "ISSNLinking": "0024-3205"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-79-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11811898", "10.1016/s0024-3205(01)01423-0", "S0024-3205(01)01423-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
