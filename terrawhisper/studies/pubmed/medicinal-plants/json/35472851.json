They have been isolated mainly from Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg. This type of natural compound is correlative with anti-diabetes, anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities. Due to the versatile activities of PECs, more and more researchers use different improved methods to synthesize them and their derivatives. This review mainly focuses on the natural occurrence, chemical synthesis, and biological activities of PECs, which were published up until 2020."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
