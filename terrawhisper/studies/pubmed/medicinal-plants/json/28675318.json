Preventive or curative effects of halophytic plants against these disorders may be a promising and safe therapeutic strategy. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate in vivo immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects of Sarcocornia perennis extract (Sp) against lead toxicity in rats. Groups of six animals each were treated with plant extract (via food), 6\u2009g/L lead acetate (via drinking water) or a combination of both. At the end of the three-week period, rat exposure to lead caused reduction of liver weight but an increase of that of kidney. Moreover, lead intoxication-induced oxidative stress manifested by significant increases of inflammatory cytokines (except IL-10) and lipid peroxidation (TBARS), compared with the control group. Meanwhile, interleukin-10 (IL-10) and glutathione levels (GSH), as well as antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), were decreased. Considering liver and renal markers, lead treatment induced a significant increase in the activities of aminotransferases (AST, ALT), and in the levels of urea, creatinine and phosphorous, whereas total plasma protein, albumin and calcium levels were significantly decreased. S. perennis extract alone did not induce any significant changes in hepatic or renal markers, whereas the antioxidant markers were significantly increased. S. perennis supplementation significantly reduced the lead-induced elevation of serum IL-1\u00df, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and TBARS but increased the IL-10 and antioxidant enzyme activities. Overall, plant components ameliorated hepatorenal damages caused by lead."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Sfax , Sfax , Tunisia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b EA 2219\u2009G\u00e9oarchitecture, Faculty of Sciences , University of Western Brittany , Brest , France."}], "LastName": "Gargouri", "ForeName": "Manel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0650-3915"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Sfax , Sfax , Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Hamed", "ForeName": "Houda", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Sfax , Sfax , Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Akrouti", "ForeName": "Amel", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b EA 2219\u2009G\u00e9oarchitecture, Faculty of Sciences , University of Western Brittany , Brest , France."}], "LastName": "Christian", "ForeName": "Magn\u00e9", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c LR15CBBC06, Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants , Borj-C\u00e9dria Biotechnology Center , Hammam-lif , Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Ksouri", "ForeName": "Riadh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Animal Ecophysiology, Faculty of Sciences , University of Sfax , Sfax , Tunisia."}], "LastName": "El Feki", "ForeName": "Abdelfattah", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Mech Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101134521", "ISSNLinking": "1537-6516"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chenopodiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Growth"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28675318", "10.1080/15376516.2017.1351018"]}}]}
