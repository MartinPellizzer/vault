Blood samples were collected at various time-points after drug administration. Analytical method based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was established to determine the plasma concentration of GFA. Pharmacokinetic evaluation was carried out using the 3P87 program.", "The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range from 0.42 microgram.mL-1 to 21.2 micrograms.mL-1 (gamma = 0.9994). The intra-day and inter-day precisions were generally good (< 15%) at low, medium and high concentrations. The overall recovery of the analytes was more than 80%. Six dogs were given an i.v. dose of 7.56 mg.kg-1 of GFA hydrochloride, an open three compartment model best described the concentration-time profiles for GFA. The half-lives for the rapid and slow distribution phase and terminal elimination phase (T1/2 pi, T1/2 alpha and T1/2 beta) were 0.07 h, 1.5 h, and 13.5 h, respectively. The total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), the volume of the central compartment (Vc), and plasma clearance (CLs) were 61.43 micrograms.h.mL-1, 0.37 L.kg-1 and 0.14 L.kg-1.h-1, respectively.", "The analytical method was shown to be sensitive, specific, rapid and reproducible, and was suitable for pharmacokinetic studies of GFA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Min-shu", "Initials": "MS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Guang-ji", "Initials": "GJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Xiao-hui", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jian-guo", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-han", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1394-48-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Guan-fu base A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Clearance Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12914327"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
