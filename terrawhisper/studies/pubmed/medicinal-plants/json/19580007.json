The experiment was carried out based of factorial experiment with Randomized Completely Blocks Design (RCBD) by three replications in Ardabil Agricultural and Natural Resources Researches Station at 2007. Seedlings were grown in heated greenhouse. When the climatic condition became suitable and seedlings were at the four leaves stage, both seeds and seedlings were planted at the same time in the farm. Maintenance operations were done during the growth season. Head pruning treatments were done the forecast time. The results showed that the planting methods had significant effect on the number of ripen fruits per plant, fruits diameter, weight of seeds per fruit, weight of 1000 seeds and seed yield and had no significant effect on the other traits. Also the results indicated that head pruning treatments had significant effects on the number of branches per plant, growth and seed yield and no significant on the other traits. In this experiment the most seed yield (997.8 kg ha(-1)) obtained from transplanting method with head pruning after 12th node and the least seed yield obtained from control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Natural Resources Research Center of Ardabil, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bahrami", "ForeName": "R Nikkhah", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Khodadadi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pirivatlo", "ForeName": "S Piry", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hassanpanah", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbita"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19580007", "10.3923/pjbs.2009.538.541"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
