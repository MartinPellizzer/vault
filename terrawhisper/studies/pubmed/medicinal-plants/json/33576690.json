In this study, many WRKY genes (<i>LrWRKY1</i>-<i>35</i>) were identified in <i>Lilium regale</i>, which is a wild lily species highly resistant to Fusarium wilt. These WRKY genes were divided into three classes (I to III) based on a phylogenetic analysis. The Class-II WRKY transcription factors were further divided into five subclasses (IIa, IIb, IIc, IId, and IIe). Moreover, the gene expression patterns based on a quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the WRKY genes were differentially expressed in the <i>L</i>. <i>regale</i> roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. Additionally, the expression of the WRKY genes was affected by an infection by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> as well as by salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and hydrogen peroxide treatments. Moreover, the LrWRKY1 protein was localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells. The recombinant LrWRKY1 protein purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i> bound specifically to DNA fragments containing the W-box sequence, and a yeast one-hybrid assay indicated that LrWRKY1 can activate transcription. A co-expression assay in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) confirmed LrWRKY1 regulates the expression of <i>LrPR10</i>-<i>5</i>. Furthermore, the overexpression of <i>LrWRKY1</i> in tobacco and the Oriental hybrid 'Siberia' (susceptible to <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>) increased the resistance of the transgenic plants to <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>. Overall, LrWRKY1 regulates the expression of the resistance gene <i>LrPR10</i>-<i>5</i> and is involved in the defense response of <i>L</i>. <i>regale</i> to <i>F</i>. <i>oxysporum</i>. This study provides valuable information regarding the expression and functional characteristics of <i>L</i>. <i>regale</i> WRKY genes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Guanze", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Pu", "ForeName": "Limei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xuyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zie", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Hongjun", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2720-6303"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Technology, Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming 650500, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Diqiu", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Phytopathology", "NlmUniqueID": "9427222", "ISSNLinking": "0031-949X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Fusarium oxysporum"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Disease Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lilium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33576690", "10.1094/PHYTO-10-20-0480-R"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
