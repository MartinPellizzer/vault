Non-dietary health risk assessment was conducted using calculate chronic daily intake (CDI) from ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact pathways and following non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the adults and adolescent. The rank order of pesticide in soil based on their concentration was malathion (0.082\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)> cyproconazole (0.019\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)> propargite (0.018\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)> butachlor (0.016\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) > chlorpyrifos (0.0067\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)> diazinon (0.0014\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)> imidacloprid (0.0007\u2009mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Hazard index (HI) values obtained of exposure to pesticides in soil in adults and adolescent were 0.0012 and 0.0035, respectively. Hence, exposed population are at the acceptable range of non-carcinogenic risk (HI\u2009<\u20091). Cancer risk (CR) values due to propargite in soil via ingestion pathway in adults and adolescent were 2.03E-09 and 2.08E-09, respectively; therefore, carcinogenic risk due to the exposure to pesticide contaminated soil was safe range (CR\u2009<\u20091E-06)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Vahideh", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Solhi Heris", "ForeName": "Mir-Ebrahim", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Health Research Center, Center of Excellence for Occupational Health, Research Center for Health Sciences, School of Public Health, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehri", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Health Engineering, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Atamaleki", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moridi Farimani", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Airlangga, Surabaya, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Mahmudiono", "ForeName": "Trias", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3579-7641"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Health Research Center, Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fakhri", "ForeName": "Yadolah", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2312-35-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Omite"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexanes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticide Residues"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexanes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36966491", "10.1080/09603123.2023.2194611"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
