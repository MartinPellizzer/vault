However, its effects on indigestion and particularly antiulcer activity of ethanol extract have not been studied. In the study, the Aucklandia lappa Decne extract (ALDE) was investigated to see if it againstgastric injury effects through traditional pathways. Ethyl alcohol and epinephrine hydrochloride were used to induce acute gastric mucous membrane damage in adult SD rats and Kunming mice, respectively. This present study evaluated its effects on peptic ulcer of ALDE treatment in SD rats and Kunming mice. In acute gastric mucous membrane damage induced by ethyl alcohol in rats, the results indicated that three ALDE treatment groups highly significantly decreased the mucosal damage index as compared to the model group. Furthermore, this mucosal damage index of the mid-dose group significantly decreased while the high-range dose group highly significantly decreased, respectively, as compared to the SO group. The ulcer inhibition rate of low -dose, mid-dose and high-dose ALDE treatment groups reached 68.64%, 72.67% and 74.91%, respectively. In acute gastric mucous membrane damage induced by pyloric ligation in rats, the results indicated that three ALDE treatment groups highly significantly decreased the mucosal damage index as compared to the model group. The mucosal damage index of middose group significantly decreased while the high-range dose group highly significantly decreased, respectively as compared to the SO group. The ulcer inhibition rate of low-dise, mid-dose and high-dose ALDE treatment groups reached 68.64%, 72.67% and 74.91%, respectively.

Our results indicated that ALDE exhibits a marked effect on peptic ulcer activity in animals, which supports previous results of its use in traditional Chinese medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing, P.R.
