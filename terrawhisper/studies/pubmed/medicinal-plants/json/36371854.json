Natural compounds extracted from medicinal plants characterized by diverse biological activities and low toxicity or side effects, are increasingly taking center stage in the search for new drugs. Currently, preclinical evaluation of natural products relies mainly on the use of immortalized cell lines of human origin or animal models. Increasing evidence indicates that cardiomyopathy models based on immortalized cell lines do not recapitulate pathogenic phenotypes accurately and a substantial physiological discrepancy between animals and humans casts doubt on the clinical relevance of animal models for these studies. The newly developed human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology in combination with highly-efficient cardiomyocyte differentiation methods provides an ideal tool for modeling human cardiomyopathies in vitro. Screening of drugs, especially screening of natural products, based on these models has been widely used and has shown that evaluation in such models can recapitulate important aspects of the physiological properties of drugs. The purpose of this review is to provide information on the latest developments in this area of research and to help researchers perform screening of natural products using the hiPSC-CM platform."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
