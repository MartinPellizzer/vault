Crude aqueous and methanolic extracts of the whole plant were investigated in vitro for preliminary phytochemical screening, antioxidant and antiglycation activities. Antioxidant activities were determined by total phenolic contents, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. For antiglycation activities browning production was noted and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) technique was used to determine glycation level. Boerhavia repens expressed considerable amounts of phytochemicals. Extract yield was found to be 4.59%-7.85% g/100g of dry matter with total phenolics ranging from 47.9- 190.77mg/GAE per g for aqueous and methanol extract respectively. Strong inhibitory effect was exhibited by methanolic extract in linoleic acid per oxidation system (86.11%, EC50=0.99mg/mL) and DPPH assay (88.65%, EC50=212.33\u03bcg/ml). In term of browning maximum inhibition (81.50%) was exhibited by methanolic extract at 37\u00b0C at third week of incubation. Both extracts expressed significant (P>0.05) and comparable inhibition of glycation level. In conclusion, Boerhavia repens showed promising antioxidant and antiglycation activities validating its therapeutic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Nazneen", "ForeName": "Fariha", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sheikh", "ForeName": "Munir A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jameel", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmacy, Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Ziaur", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "advanced glycation end products-human serum albumin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ZIF514RVZR", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nyctaginaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27383484"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
