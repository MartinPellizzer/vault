Quantitative analysis of total phenolic content (TPC) analysis is based on calorimetric measurements determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with gallic acid (GA) used as the reference. In vitro cytotoxicity assay by using fibroblast (L929) cell lines was performed on each plant to determine the toxicity effect which sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as the positive control. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl) assay was conducted by using vitamin C and GA as the positive controls to determine the antioxidant property of each plant.", "The MLT analysis indicated that the suitable dosage gamma irradiation for leaf extracts was 6-12\u00a0kGy and dried leaves were 9-13\u00a0kGy. The amount of GA concentration in each plant increased significantly from 30-51\u00a0mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> before treatment to 57-103\u00a0mg GAE g<sup>-1</sup> after treatment with gamma radiation. This showed no significant effect of in vitro cytotoxicity activity before and after treatment with gamma irradiation in this study. Effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) values of Khaya senegalensis plant reduced significantly (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.005) from 44.510\u00a0\u03bcg/ml before treatment to 24.691\u00a0\u03bcg/ml after treatment with gamma radiation, which indicate an increase of free radical scavenging activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
