However, how to discover and enrich them efficiently is a question for herbal pharmaceuticals researchers. In our work, a novel two-dimensional reversed-phase/hydrophilic interaction high-performance liquid chromatography method was established to perform real-time components trapping and combining for preparation and isolation of coeluting components. Arenaria kansuensis was taken as an example, and solid-phase extraction coupled with liquid-liquid extraction as a simple and efficient method for enriching trace components, reversed phase column coupled with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography XAmide column as two-dimensional chromatography technology for isolation and preparation of coeluting constituents, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay as bio-guided assay, and anti-inflammatory bioactivity evaluation for bioactive constituents. A combination of 12 \u03b2-carboline alkaloids was identified as anti-inflammatory bioactive equivalent combinatorial components from A. kansuensis, which accounts for 1.9% w/w of original A. kansuensis. This work answers the key question of which are real anti-inflammatory components from A. kansuensis and provides a fast and efficient approach for discovering and enriching trace \u03b2-carboline alkaloids from herbal medicines for the first time. More importantly, the discovery of bioactive equivalent combinatorial components could improve the quality control of herbal products and inspire a herbal medicine based on combinatorial therapeutics."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
