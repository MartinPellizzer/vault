Blood was taken every two weeks prior to and during treatment and serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, E2, progesterone (P) and testosterone were assayed. Premarin test and LH-RH test were examined prior to and during treatment. Of 7 women who were suffering with amenorrhea TJ-23 treatment brought about menstruation in 4 women; 3 were ovulated and TJ-106 brought about menstruation in 3 women; 2 were ovulated. Of 4 women with anovulatory cycle TJ-23 or TJ-106 treatment brought about ovulation in 2 women. Of 10 women with luteal phase dysfunction TJ-23 treatment brought about normal midluteal P levels in 7 women; 4 among them were pregnant, and TJ-106 brought about normal P levels in 6 women; one of them was pregnant. Improvement of hypothalamic-pituitary function was suggested during treatment by Premarin test and LH-RH test. These evidences infer that TJ-23 and TJ-106 may exert their effect on hypothalamic-pituitary area and may activate ovarian function; however, direct effect on ovary and factors except endocrine mechanism may not be excluded."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Koyama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ichimura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "unkei-to"}, {"RegistryNumber": "21AIQ4EV64", "NameOfSubstance": "peoniflorin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bridged-Ring Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3218631", "10.1142/S0192415X8800008X", "S0192415X8800008X"]}}]}
