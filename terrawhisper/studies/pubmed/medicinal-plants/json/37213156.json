There is a physiological equilibrium between aggressive factors and mucosal defense. The purpose of this research was to compare the prevention level and efficiency of herbal medicinal plants (Punica granatum) to the omeprazole drug. Many groups were prepared from Albino male rats, the first control group (inoculate with\u00a0H. pylori\u00a0and fed with standard pellet), the Second group, rats inoculated by\u00a0H. pylori\u00a0and prevented with Punica granatum aqueous extracts (PGAE) in two dosages (250mg/kg, 500mg/kg), and last group inoculated by\u00a0H. pylori\u00a0and prevented with standard drug omeprazole at the dose (20mg/kg). The results showed that the Ulcer Inhibition % of Punica granatum with a high dose of 500mg/kg and a low dose of 250mg/kg was 84.60\u00b15.48 and 42.87\u00b17.14, respectively. While in the omeprazole treatment group, Ulcer Inhibition % was 24.50\u00b16.35 and this Ulcer Inhibition % \u00a0in the Punica granatum treatment groups was significant compared to the omeprazole treatment group and the control group (P=0.0001). PGAE displayed a significant lessening in stomach index and infectious cell proliferation with much cell damage. Although the result of the current study improves, a high dosage of aqueous extracts of plants has more effectiveness than a low dosage of aqueous extracts plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Production, College of Agricultural Engineering Science, University of Garmian, Kalar, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Muhialdin", "ForeName": "Ali J", "Initials": "AJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Alamri", "ForeName": "Zaenah Zuhair", "Initials": "ZZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Science, Cihan University-Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "M Hussein", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Garmian, Kalar, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Faraj", "ForeName": "Rahman K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry, College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences, Salahaddin University-Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Taha", "ForeName": "Zhala B", "Initials": "ZB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Science, Cihan University-Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Hussein", "ForeName": "Mohammed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, College of Education, Salahaddin University-Erbil, Kurdistan Region, Iraq. ali.m.hussein@cihanuniversity.edu.iq."}], "LastName": "Mojarradgandoukmolla", "ForeName": "Shahrokh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KG60484QX9", "NameOfSubstance": "Omeprazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "804826J2HU", "NameOfSubstance": "Amoxicillin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter pylori"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pomegranate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Omeprazole"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Helicobacter Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Amoxicillin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "46"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37213156", "10.14715/cmb/2022.69.1.9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
