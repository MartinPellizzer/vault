The shock wave treated kidneys were observed for the expression of p-selectin and the change of cells ultrastructure pre and post ESWL. The concentration of Maleic Dialdehyde (MDA) as well as activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the kidney tissues was also analyzed.", "After application of shock wave treatment, p-selectin was expressed extensively in renal glomerulus, renal tubules and renal interstitium of the treated kidneys. It showed a significant increase of MDA levels and decrease of SOD activity in control group (P < 0.05) after ESWL. The comparison between controls and TSA group demonstrated that TSA could significantly reduce the positive rate of p-selectin P < 0.05) and alleviate the injuries of cells ultrastructure. The results also showed a significant decrease of MDA levels and increase of SOD activity in TSA group compared to controls (P < 0.05). The protective effects of TFA and TPA in alleviating kidney injury induced by shock wave were lower than those of TSA; they had no effects of the expression of P-selectin.", "TSA is the main components of A. mongholicus in alleviating shock wave induced kidney injury not only by scavenging oxygen free radicals but also inhibiting the expression of p-selectin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Urology, Key Laboratory of Environment and Genes Related to Diseases, Ministry of Education, Xi ' an Jiaotong University, Xi ' an 710061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Da-lin", "Initials": "DL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Xing-fa", "Initials": "XF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin-lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Lin-hua", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-jun", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "P-Selectin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["injuries", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Glomerulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Tubules"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lithotripsy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "P-Selectin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16422544"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
