In this way, to improve the pharmaceutical properties, morin was complexed in hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD) and its oral bioavailability and anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated. Initially, a phase solubility study was performed, which showed that HP-\u03b2-CD would be the better cyclodextrin for the formation of complexes with morin. The morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex (1:1) was prepared by freeze-drying method. The sample obtained was characterized by DSC, FTIR, PXRD, SEM and <sup>1</sup>H NMR techniques, evidencing the formation of morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex. In addition, complexation efficiency (98.3%) and loading content (17.63%), determined by HPLC demonstrated that morin was efficiently complexed in HP-\u03b2-CD. In vitro dissolution study confirmed that morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex increased the solubility and dissolution rate of morin. The oral bioavailability of the morin/HP-\u03b2-CD complex and free morin were evaluated through a pharmacokinetic study in rat plasma. The oral bioavailability of morin complexed with HP-\u03b2-CD was increased by 4.20 times compared with the free morin. Hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan and carrageenan-induced pleurisy were carried out in mice to evaluate the antihyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of free morin and inclusion complex. Morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex showed antihyperalgesic effect in inflammatory pain model and anti-inflammatory effect decreasing leukocyte migration and TNF-\u03b1 levels at a lower dose than free morin. Therefore, the morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex improved the solubility, dissolution rate, oral bioavailability, antihyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of morin. In this way, the morin/HP-\u03b2-CD inclusion complex exhibits potential for development of new pharmaceutical product for future clinical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
