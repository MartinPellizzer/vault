We now describe two additional protein fractions that interact with this DNA element. The three protein fractions have similar binding properties with the exception of their binding stabilities. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that these protein fractions bind to a region that is located about 60 bp upstream from the site of initiation of transcription. From methylation interference experiments and gel-retardation assays with mutated oligonucleotides, it was evident that the protein fractions required the same residues for the formation of stable DNA-protein(s) complexes. However, the three protein fractions were chromatographically distinguishable and the stability of their binding to DNA was different. Although the functions of these fractions are still unknown, the fact that several protein fractions can bind to a narrow region near the site of initiation of transcription is of considerable interest in terms of the mechanism of transcription of the rRNA gene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanifuji", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komeda", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kato", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA-Binding Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA-Binding Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8528605", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a078847"]}}]}
