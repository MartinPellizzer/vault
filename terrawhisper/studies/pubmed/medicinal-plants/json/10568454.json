Berseem clover hay had lower (P < .05) concentrations of NDF, ADF, and CP than alfalfa hay. The digestibility of DM, DMI, and N balance did not differ (P > .05) between diets containing alfalfa hay or berseem clover hay. To evaluate stockpiled berseem clover as a supplement for grazed corn crop residues, berseem clover and oats were incorporated into a corn-corn-oat/berseem clover crop rotation for 3 yr in replicated 6.1-ha fields. Two cuttings of oat-berseem clover hay were harvested each summer before forage was stockpiled for winter grazing. After corn grain harvest, multiparous and primiparous crossbred cows in midgestation were allotted to each field at 1.01 ha/cow to strip-graze corn crop residues with or without stockpiled berseem clover or allocated to replicated drylots for 98 to 140 d. Each group was offered alfalfa-grass hay as large bales to maintain a mean body condition score of 5 on a 9-point scale. Mean rates of total and digestible OM disappearance from grazed and ungrazed field areas of berseem clover and corn crop residues did not differ over the 3 yr. In vitro organic matter disappearance (IVOMD) tended to decrease more rapidly (P = .13) and NDF and ADF concentrations increased more rapidly (P < .05) in berseem clover than in corn crop residues. Seasonal BW change did not differ (P > .05) between winter management systems in any year, and seasonal body condition score changes did not differ (P > .05) between cows grazing corn crop residues and berseem clover and those maintained in a drylot in yr 2 and 3. Cows grazing corn crop residues with or without berseem clover required less (P < .05) hay than those maintained in drylot. Although the effects of berseem clover hay supplementation on the intake and digestibility of corn crop residues do not differ from alfalfa hay, the nutritional value of stockpiled berseem clover decreases rapidly during winter, limiting its value as a standing supplement for corn crop residues in late winter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Iowa State University, Ames 50011, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Karsli", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Russell", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hersom", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicago sativa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10568454", "10.2527/1999.77112873x"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
