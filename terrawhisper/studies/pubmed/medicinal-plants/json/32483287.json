Rutin is a glycoside of the flavonoid quercetin that has been reported to have a beneficial role in controlling various diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity. In this study, the partial cDNA of four genes involved in the rutin biosynthetic pathway including 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and flavonol-3-O-glucoside L-rhamnosyltransferase (RT) were identified in C.spinosa plants for the first time. The protein sequences of these genes shared high similarity with the same proteins in other plant species. Subsequently, the expression patterns of these genes as well as rutin accumulation in C.spinosa leaves treated with different concentrations of salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and also in different tissues of Caper plants treated with 100 mgL<sup>-1</sup> SA and 150\u2009\u03bcM MeJA were evaluated. The expression of all four genes was clearly up-regulated and rutin contents increased in response to MeJA and SA treatments after 24\u2009h. The highest rutin contents (5.30 mgg<sup>-1</sup> DW and 13.27 mgg<sup>-1</sup> DW), as well as the highest expression levels of all four genes, were obtained using 100 mgL<sup>-1</sup> SA and 150\u2009\u03bcM MeJA, respectively. Among the different tissues, the highest rutin content was observed in young leaves treated with 150\u2009\u03bcM MeJA, which corresponded to the expression of related genes, especially RT, as a key gene in the rutin biosynthetic pathway. These results suggest that rutin content in various tissues of C. spinosa can be enhanced to a significant extent by MeJA and SA treatments and the gene expression patterns of rutin-biosynthesis-related genes are regulated by these elicitors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kianersi", "ForeName": "Farzad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran. m.abdollahi@basu.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Bu-Ali Sina University, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaie-Asl", "ForeName": "Asghar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Dara", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Breeding, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, V\u00e4xtskyddsv\u00e4gen 1, SE-230 53, Alnarp, Sweden."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology, School of Chemical Science and Engineering, Fibre and Polymer Technology, SE-100 44, Stockholm, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Rasheed", "ForeName": "Faiza", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Sci Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101563288", "ISSNLinking": "2045-2322"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxylipins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "900N171A0F", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl jasmonate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O414PZ4LPZ", "NameOfSubstance": "Salicylic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capparis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclopentanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxylipins"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Salicylic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Up-Regulation"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no competing interests."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Winkel-Shirley B.
