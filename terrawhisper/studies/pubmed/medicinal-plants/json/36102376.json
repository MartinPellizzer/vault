Cluster analysis and variance analysis showed that hybrids had variations in yield indices. GB, DE and GS hybrids had similar performance on indices. SE hybrid that has significant performance on zeaxanthin. Biplot showed that fructose, glucose, sucrose and potassium had stability value on hybrids. All the hybrids had the best performance on fructose, glucose, sucrose and potassium factors. Factor biplot positively correlated with yield indices, including calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, \u03b1-Carotene, 9Z-\u03b2-Carotene, phosphorus, and \u03b2-carotene. On the other hand, there is a positive correlation with fructose, glucose, potassium, lutein, sucrose, \u03b2-Cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin. So, to evaluate or increase lutein and zeaxanthin, the other parameters like sugar content (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) are important factors and have an effect together. Factor analysis and biplot showed that ME hybrid had a maximum performance on the first factor of yield indices. Also, the second factor of yield indices had a maxi-mum effect on NO hybrids. SE hybrids had maximum performance in zeaxanthin and GS hybrid had maximum performance in zinc, phosphorus, and iron. The dry matter had stability on DB hybrid."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8057-0086"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Debrecen, Faculty of
