Mapping genetic factors controlling host-bacteria interactions.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "341", "EndPage": "350", "MedlinePgn": "341-50"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genetic linkage maps allow us to dissect the genetic control of quantitative traits (QT) by locating individual quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on the linkage map and determining their type of gene action and the magnitude of their contribution to the phenotype of the QT. We have performed such an analysis for two traits in common bean, involving interactions between the plant host and bacteria, namely Rhizobium nodule number (NN) and resistance to common bacterial blight (CBB) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli. Analyses were conducted in the progeny of a cross between BAT93 (fewer nodules; moderately resistant to CBB) and Jalo EEP558 (more nodules; susceptible to CBB). An RFLP-based linkage map for common bean based on 152 markers had previously been derived in the F2 of this cross. Seventy F2-derived F3 families were inoculated in separate greenhouse experiments with Rhizobium tropici strain UMR1899 or X. c. pv. phaseoli isolate isolate W18. Regression and interval mapping analyses were used to identify genomic regions involved in the genetic control of these traits. These two methods identified the same genomic regions for each trait, with a few exceptions. For each trait, at least four putative QTLs were identified, which accounted for approximately 50% and 75% of the phenotypic variation in NN and CBB resistance, respectively. A chromosome region on linkage group D7 carried factor(s) influencing both traits. In all other cases, the putative QTLs affecting NN and CBB were located in different linkage groups or in the same linkage group, but far apart (more than 50 cM). Both BAT93 and Jalo EEP558 contributed alleles associated with higher NN, whereas CBB resistance was always associated with BAT93 alleles. Further investigations are needed to determine whether the QTLs for NN and CBB on linkage group D7 represent linked genes or the same gene with pleiotropic effects. Identification of the QTLs raises the possibility of initiating map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection for these traits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Range Science, University of California, Davis 95616-8515."}], "LastName": "Nodari", "ForeName": "R O", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guzm\u00e1n", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gilbertson", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gepts", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Genetics", "NlmUniqueID": "0374636", "ISSNLinking": "0016-6731"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Linkage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Genetics. 1991 Jan;127(1):181-97", "ArticleIdList": ["1673106"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1989 Jan;121(1):185-99", "ArticleIdList": ["2563713"]}, {"Citation": "Science. 1989 Mar 31;243(4899):1725-8", "ArticleIdList": ["17751282"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact. 1990 Jan-Feb;3(1):4-8", "ArticleIdList": ["2132024"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Oct;97(2):759-64", "ArticleIdList": ["16668463"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1991 Oct;97(2):751-8", "ArticleIdList": ["16668462"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1988 Oct 20;335(6192):721-6", "ArticleIdList": ["2902517"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1987 May;116(1):113-25", "ArticleIdList": ["3596228"]}, {"Citation": "J Bacteriol. 1991 Jun;173(11):3432-9", "ArticleIdList": ["2045365"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1990 Nov;126(3):735-42", "ArticleIdList": ["1979039"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1931 Jul;16(4):357-74", "ArticleIdList": ["17246626"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1992 Jun 25;357(6380):655-60", "ArticleIdList": ["1614514"]}, {"Citation": "Annu Rev Genet. 1990;24:447-63", "ArticleIdList": ["2088175"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8514141", "PMC1205436", "10.1093/genetics/134.1.341"]}}]}
