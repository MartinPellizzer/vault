Their structures were elucidated through comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis (IR, UV, NMR, HRESIMS), ECD calculations, and X-ray crystallography. The antitomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and antifungal (against <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, <i>Gibberella zeae</i>, <i>Phytophythora capsica</i>, and <i>Alternaria alternata</i>) and insecticidal (against <i>Aphis fabae</i> and <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>) activities of the isolated compounds were screened using the lesion counting method, mycelial inhibition assay, and spray method, respectively. The bioassay results showed that <b>34</b> exhibited excellent protective activity against TSWV, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 36.04 \u03bcg/mL, which was better than that of the positive control, ningnanmycin (86.03 \u03bcg/mL). The preliminary mechanistic exploration illustrated that <b>34</b> induced systemic acquired resistance in the host plant by acting on the salicylic acid signaling pathway. Moreover, <b>1</b> showed significant antifungal activity against <i>B. cinerea</i> (EC<sub>50</sub> value of 20.83 \u03bcg/mL), while <b>2</b> exhibited good insecticidal activity against <i>A. fabae</i> (LC<sub>50</sub> value of 24.97 \u03bcg/mL). This research is promising for the invention of novel pesticides from QAs with high efficiency and satisfactory ecological compatibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
