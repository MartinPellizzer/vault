Warfarin pharmacotherapy is extremely complex, since in addition to being a low therapeutic index drug, it does not follow the dose-response pattern and has characteristics that predispose the occurrence of interactions, such as high binding rate to plasma proteins, metabolization by cytochrome P450 enzymes, further to acting in the complex process of blood coagulation, platelet activation, and inflammation. For these reasons, warfarin has great potential for interaction with drugs, foods, and herbal medicines. Herb-warfarin interactions, however, are still not very well studied; thus, the objective of this update is to present new information on the subject aiming to provide a scientific basis to help health professionals in the clinical management of these interactions. A literature review was performed from May to June 2021 in multiple databases and articles published in 2016 to 2021 were included. A total of 59 articles describing 114 herbal medicines were reported to interact with warfarin. Of the plants mentioned, 84% had the potential to increase warfarin effect and the risk of bleeding. Targets possibly involved in these interactions include the processes of blood coagulation, platelet activation, and inflammation, in addition to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Despite these alarming numbers, however, the clinical management of interactions is known to be effective. Thus, it is important that the use of these herbal medicines be done with caution in anticoagulated patients and that studies of herb-drug interactions be encouraged in order to generate information to support the clinical management of patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
