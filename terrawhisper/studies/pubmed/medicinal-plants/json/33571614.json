KGR is widely used in traditional Indian medicines to treat fever (jwar), rheumatism (Amavata), respiratory (Shwasa), hypertension (Vyanabala vaishamya) and cardiovascular disorders (Vyanavayu Dushtijanya Hrudrog). Although ethnomedicinal properties have extensively been demonstrated in traditional medicines of south-east countries i.e. China, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia, the chemico-biological validation are still lacking.", "Chemico-biological standardization with respect to its vasorelaxation potential is the main objective of the present study. To investigate the vasorelaxation potential of key phytochemical of KGR, i.e., ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate (EPMC) and to study it's the mechanism of action.", "A HPLC method was developed and validated for the quality assessment of KGR using its two major phytochemicals i.e. ethyl-p-methoxycinnamate (EPMC) and ethyl cinnamate (EC) in KGR. The vasorelaxation effect of major phytochemicals of KGR was evaluated on the main mesenteric arteries isolated from male Wistar rats. Specific BKca channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), receptor antagonist, nitric oxide scavenging capacity, and antioxidant potential were also evaluated for its plausible mechanism.", "Present validated HPLC method facilitates simultaneous quantitation of EPMC and EC faster than classical GC techniques. EPMC has shown a dose-dependent relaxation in rat main mesenteric arteries (MMA) contracted by U46619 with an E<sub>max</sub> of 58.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.31%. Similarly, in endothelium-denuded MMA rings, relaxation was also observed (E<sub>max</sub> of 61.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.38%). Moreover, relaxation response to EPMC has strongly inhibited (E<sub>max</sub> 14.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.29%) when the tissue exposed to depolarizing high K<sup>+</sup> containing buffer for the contraction. The point correlation dimension (pD2) values were also significantly decreased in high K<sup>+</sup> treated arterial rings compared to control. Interestingly, when MMA rings incubated with a specific BK<sub>ca</sub> channel blocker (TEA, 1\u00a0mM), the relaxation response to EPMC was also significantly blocked.", "The first time this study demonstrated the chemical standardization of K. galanga rhizome and EPMC is responsible for its vasorelaxation potential as demonstrated by the endothelium-independent response mediated by Ca2+ dependent potassium channels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
