Further, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance TLC, and column chromatography were performed to isolate the potentially active fraction and anti-inflammatory activity of crude, and the isolated fraction was tested on J774 macrophage cell line.", "The maximum inhibition of superoxide anions was shown by Pant Aparna. Additionally, Pant Aparna extract was most efficient, exhibiting 92.0% inhibition in scavenging the DPPH radicals. The content of total carotenoids was found to be higher in Pant Aparna among all the varieties/accessions. Furthermore, the crude extract and the fraction <i>A. marmelos</i> methanolic fraction 21 (AMMF21) were found to be nontoxic and significant reactive oxygen species, and NO inhibition was observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the methanolic extract of variety Pant Aparna showed promising <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity, indicating its potency for therapeutic applications.", "In brief, this is the first ever report on Pant Aparna as the best variety in terms of phytocompounds and identification of potential antioxidant activity. In addition, the AMMF21 fraction of methanolic extract possessing best antioxidant activity on macrophage cells indicates its use as a novel phytotherapeutic agent.", "Our study identifies the best variety/accession of <i>Aegle marmelos</i> possessing the potential antioxidant and reactive oxygen species scavenging activity possessed by the methanolic crude extract of variety Pant Aparna along with the fraction <i>A. marmelos</i> methanolic fraction 21 isolated through column chromatography on J774 murine macrophage cell lineThe high-performance thin-layer chromatography fingerprinting profile obtained acts as a diagnostic tool to identify and determine the quality and purity of this extract and fraction in future studiesOn the basis of the results obtained, the above variety should be taken further to exploit its immense potential for other biological activities of medicinal importancePant Aparna is an outstanding variety of <i>A. marmelos</i> and should be extensively studied for isolation of a novel and potential therapeutic agent. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> AMMF21: <i>Aegle marmelos</i> methanolic fraction 21, DPPH: (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), FRAP: Ferric-reducing ability of plasma, HP-TLC: High-performance-thin-layer chromatography, TLC: Thin-layer chromatography, TCA: Trichloroacetic acid, TPTZ: 2,4,6-Tripyridyl-s-triazine, DNPH: 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine, NBT: Nitroblue tetrazolium, NADH: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, PMS: Phenazine metho-sulfate, DMEM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; MTT: (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, DCFDA: 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, LPS: Lipopolysaccharide, NED: N-(1-Naphthyl) ethylenediamine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Mujeeb", "ForeName": "Farina", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Ahamad Faiz", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Bajpai", "ForeName": "Preeti", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Pathak", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Tripathi L, Tripathi NJ.
