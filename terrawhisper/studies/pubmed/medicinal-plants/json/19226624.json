The formulations were examined for their properties and the desired quality was then achieved using a quality by design (QBD) approach. For this purpose, a Draper-Lin small composite design study was employed in order to investigate the effect of four independent variables, including the PO to water ratio, the concentration of pH sensitive polymer (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate), acid and plasticizer concentrations, on the encapsulation efficiency and PO loading. The analysis of variance showed that the polymer concentration was the most important variable on encapsulation efficiency (p < 0.05). The multiple regression analysis of the results led to equations that adequately described the influence of the independent variables on the selected responses. Furthermore, the desirability function was employed as an effective tool for transforming each response separately and encompassing all of these responses in an overall desirability function for global optimization of the encapsulation process. The optimized macroparticles were predicted to yield 93.4% encapsulation efficiency and 72.8% PO loading, which were remarkably close to the experimental values of 89.2% and 69.5%, consequently."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants & Drugs Research Institute, Shahid Beheshti University, G.
