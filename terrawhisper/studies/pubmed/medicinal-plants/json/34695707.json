P. Karst. Their structures and absolute configurations were characterized by extensive analysis of spectroscopic data and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Nor-pinicolic acids A-F possess unusual C-25-C-27 nor-lanostane skeletons, which were first reported from F. pinicola. Anti-inflammatory assays indicated that pinicopsic acid F and 16\u03b1-hydroxy-3-oxolanosta-7,9(11),24-trien-21-oic acid showed moderate inhibitory activities against LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7\u00a0cells, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 24.5 and 25.7\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
