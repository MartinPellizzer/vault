The extract significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced paw edema and reduced the yeast-induced hyperpyrexia. It also prolonged the reaction time of mice on the hot plate. However, the extract exacerbated indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal damage. The coagulation studies showed a significant increase in fibrinogen level and an insignificant decrease in prothrombin time, confirming its coagulating property. The toxicity tests showed that the administration of extract in single doses of 0.5 to 3.0g/kg did not produce any adverse effects or mortality in mice, whereas the animals treated with extract (100 mg/kg/day) for a period of 3 months in drinking water showed no symptoms of toxicity except a statistically insignificant higher mortality rate. These findings suggest that the seeds of Cress (L. sativum) possess significant anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and coagulant activities, and are free from serious side or toxic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 1994 Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart \u00b7 Jena \u00b7 New York.
