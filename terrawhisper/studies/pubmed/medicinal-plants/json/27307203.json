Its cultivation has received considerable attention in order to meet the high demand. High levels of cadmium (Cd) and aluminum (Al) in H.\u00a0hemerocallidea plants sold in traditional medicinal markets was previously reported. The present study used an in\u00a0vitro propagation model to investigate the uptake of Cd and Al by H.\u00a0hemerocallidea and their effect on plant growth, elemental uptake and some stress-induced responses such as pigment, malondialdehyde (MDA), proline content and ultrastructural changes. Shoot and root growth of plantlets exposed to Cd, Cd:Al and high concentrations of Al was significantly reduced. Highest concentrations of Cd accumulated in the corms of Cd-treated plantlets while highest Al concentrations occurred in the leaves and roots. There was higher accumulation of Cd and Al when applied singularly compared to the Cd:Al combination treatments. Cd and Al also reduced accumulation of trace elements in micropropagted H.\u00a0hemerocallidea with lowest concentrations in the Cd:Al combination treatments. Exposure to Cd, Al and Cd:Al significantly reduced the level of chlorophyll but increased the levels of carotenoids, MDA and proline. Ultrastructural changes were also observed in H.\u00a0hemerocallidea exposed to Cd and Al. All these factors contributed to the inhibition of plant growth and could potentially affect the ability of this important medicinal plant to synthesize bioactive compounds. It is thus necessary to understand heavy metal stress-induced responses in this highly valued medicinal plant to ensure a high quality product for the consumer."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2016 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Okem", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Moyo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Stirk", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Finnie", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Life Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Van Staden", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant Biol (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101148926", "ISSNLinking": "1435-8603"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DLQ4CIU6V", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27307203", "10.1111/plb.12480"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
