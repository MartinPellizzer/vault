Sanguisorba minor has been traditionally used to cure various ailments. Few studies have reported pharmacological activities of this medicinal plant. This research aimed to investigate the effects of Sanguisorba minor extract (SME) on brain and liver injury in aging rats and identify the underlying mechanisms. The aging model was developed by subcutaneously injecting D\u2011galactose and simultaneously treating them with SME. After biochemical and pathological assessments, mRNA expression levels of nuclear factor\u2011erythroid factor 2\u2011related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Nrf2\u2011 regulated gene, heme oxygenase\u20111 (HO\u20111), in the brain and liver tissues were determined. As a result, malondialdehyde and acetylcholinesterase levels were elevated while total thiol content and superoxide dismutase were reduced in the aging rats. Treatment with the extract remarkably attenuated oxidative injury and pathological changes in liver and brain tissues. Concomitantly, the extract up\u2011regulated Nrf2 and HO\u20111 genes. Our findings exhibited SME may improve the aging\u2011related brain and liver damage through the Nrf2\u2011HO\u20111 pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzavi", "ForeName": "Farshad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; rajabianar@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Rajabian", "ForeName": "Arezoo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroumand-Noughabi", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hassanzadeh", "ForeName": "Sonita", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars)", "NlmUniqueID": "1246675", "ISSNLinking": "0065-1400"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sanguisorba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36748966", "10.55782/ane-2022-041", "8274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
