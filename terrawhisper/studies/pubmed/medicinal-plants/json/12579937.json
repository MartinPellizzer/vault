Component analysis showed that it composed of Ara and Gal in a molar ratio of 3:4, and 18 kinds of amino acids. The immunologic function and bioactivity of Lbp2 has been studied preliminarily. Lbp2 was shown to increase rate of phagocyticaction and phagocytic index, promote lymphocyte translation and accelerate the production of serum hemolysin. LbGp2 has distinct effect of antioxidation and the superoxide anion produced by DMSO-NaOH system was scavenged effectively.", "LbGp2 was shown to be a kind of homogeneous glycoconjugate with good immunoactivity and antioxidative activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, State Key Laboratory of Bio-organic Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Shanghai 200032, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "X M", "Initials": "XM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Z F", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "G Y", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "glycoconjugate LbGp2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoconjugates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12579937"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
