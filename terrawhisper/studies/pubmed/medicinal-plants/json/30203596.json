However, the antileukemic effects of crocetin are still unclear, especially in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. In the current study, the potential antipromyelocytic leukemia activity of crocetin and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Crocetin (100\u2009\u00b5M), like standard anti-APL drugs, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 10\u2009\u00b5M) and As<sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub> (arsenic trioxide, 50\u2009\u00b5M), significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in primary APL cells, as well as NB4 and HL60 cells. The effect was associated with the decreased expressions of prosurvival genes Akt and BCL2, the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, ABCB1 and ABCC1 and the inhibition of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), while the expressions of proapoptotic genes CASP3, CASP9, and BAX/BCL2 ratio were significantly increased. In contrast, crocetin at relatively low concentration (10\u2009\u00b5M), like ATRA (1\u2009\u00b5M) and As <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub> (0.5\u2009\u00b5M), induced differentiation of leukemic cells toward granulocytic pattern, and increased the number of differentiated cells expressing CD11b and CD14, while the number of the immature cells expressing CD34 or CD33 was decreased. Furthermore, crocetin suppressed the expression of clinical marker promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-\u03b1 ( PML/RAR\u03b1) in NB4 and primary APL cells, and reduced the expression of histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1) in all leukemic cells. The results suggested that crocetin can be considered as a candidate for future preclinical and clinical trials of complementary APL treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6094-8712"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Golestan Rheumatology Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of New Sciences and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moradzadeh", "ForeName": "Maliheh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Jahrom University of Medical Sciences, Jahrom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Erfanian", "ForeName": "Saiedeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine Department, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohaddes", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Tahereh", "Initials": "ST"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Internal Medicine Department, Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahimi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Next Generation Genetic Clinic, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimiani", "ForeName": "Ehsan Ghayoor", "Initials": "EG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mashkani", "ForeName": "Baratali", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Krebs and Sheffield Institute of Nucleic Acids, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."}], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Shih-Chieh", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Krebs and Sheffield Institute of Nucleic Acids, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK."}], "LastName": "El-Khamisy", "ForeName": "Sherif F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tabarraei", "ForeName": "Alijan", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3228-6897"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of New Sciences and Technology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Neurocognitive Sciences, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid Reza", "Initials": "HR"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Adams J, Nassiri M.
