Despite advances in clinical management, the response to current treatments is dismal, with a 2-year survival rate varying between 6 and 12 percent. Metformin, a derivative of biguanide widely used in treating type 2 diabetes, has been shown to extend the lifespan of patients with various malignancies. There is limited evidence available on the long-term survival of GBM patients who have taken metformin. This research examined the literature to assess the connection between metformin's anticancer properties and GBM development. Clinical findings, together with the preclinical data from animal models and cell lines, are included in the present review. This comprehensive review covers not only the association of hyperactivation of the AMPK pathway with the anticancer activity of metformin but also other mechanisms underpinning its role in apoptosis, cell proliferation, metastasis, as well as its chemo-radio-sensitizing behavior against GBM. Current challenges and future directions for developments and applications of metformin-based therapeutics are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sanati", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neuroscience and Addiction Studies, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aminyavari", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Gonabad University of Medical Sciences, Gonabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Motamed-Sanaye", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bibak", "ForeName": "Bahram", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohtashami", "ForeName": "Elmira", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA30322, USA."}], "LastName": "Teng", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Afshari", "ForeName": "Amir R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9100L32L2N", "NameOfSubstance": "Metformin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Metformin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glioblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35796457", "10.2174/0929867329666220707103525", "CMC-EPUB-125031"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
