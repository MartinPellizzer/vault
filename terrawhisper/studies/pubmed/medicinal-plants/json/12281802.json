{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["There is a cultural gap between health workers and mothers in Indonesia concerning diagnosis and treatment of childhood diarrhea. Mothers have 6 terms for various kinds of diarrhea, and several ways of managing the disorder, ranging from traditional herbs, changing the foods offered to children, giving them more fluids, seeking injections or over the counter medications to religious rituals. Oral rehydration therapy, either the packaged Oralyte or homemade sugar-salt solutions are generally considered only a first-aid treatment to be given temporarily until better medications can be obtained. This view was found in a village where health staff and village leaders were specifically trained in diarrhea treatment, as well in a control village where no particular program was emphasized. Even the health center staff did not appreciate the significance of dehydration in lethal diarrhea. It is recommended that health personnel be trained to realize that ORT is the most important treatment for diarrhea; that drug marketing be improved; that a specific Indonesian term be used for diarrhea; and that ORT be distributed by social marketing."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["054675", "00182748"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: DIALOGUE ON DIARRHOEA"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Bacterial And Fungal Diseases", "Biology", "Communication", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diarrhea", "Diarrhea, Infantile", "Diseases", "Drugs", "Education", "Gastrointestinal Effects", "Health", "Health Education", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Iec", "Indonesia", "Infections", "Medicine", "Misinformation", "Oral Rehydration", "Organization And Administration", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Program Activities", "Programs", "Self Care", "Southeastern Asia", "Treatment", "Viral Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12281802", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "08", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0950-0235", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "34", "PubDate": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Dialogue on diarrhoea", "ISOAbbreviation": "Dialogue Diarrhoea"}, "ArticleTitle": "Viewpoint: Indonesia.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "4", "MedlinePgn": "4"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Satoto", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sriyuningsih", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mu Sawa"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Dialogue Diarrhoea", "NlmUniqueID": "9426468", "ISSNLinking": "0950-0235"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea, Infantile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fluid Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Planning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Information Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Therapeutics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12281802"]}}]}
