However, investigations on the advantages of plant species and environmental pollution in polluted mining areas are limited. Thus, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impacts of abandoned mines on the surrounding ecological environment along rivers in polluted areas and to determine the Arsenic (As) pollution status in soil and plants. The results showed that the soil and vegetation along the river in the survey area were seriously polluted by As. The total As content of the 15 samples was significantly greater than the national soil background value (GB 15618-2018), and degree of pollution was nonlinearly related to the distance from the mine source, R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.9844. B. bipinnata, P. vittata and B. nivea were predominant with degrees of dominance of 0.01-0.33, 0.05-0.11, and 0.06-0.14 respectively. The As enrichment capacities of Juncus and P. vittata were significantly greater than those of the other plants, while the bioaccumulation factors (BCFs) were 21.81 and 7.04, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
