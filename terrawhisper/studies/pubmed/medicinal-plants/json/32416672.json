With the development of the health industry, the market demands for Chinese medicine have been rapidly increasing in recent years. However, over-utilization of herbal plants would cause serious ecological problems. Therefore, an effective approach should be developed to produce the pharmaceutically important natural drugs. Hairy root culture induced by Agrobacterium rhizogenes has been considered to be an effective tool to produce secondary metabolites that are originally biosynthesized in the roots or even in the aerial organs of mature plants. This review aims to summarize current progress on medicinal plant hairy root culture for bioactive compounds production. It presents the stimulating effects of various biotic and abiotic elicitors on the accumulation of secondary metabolites. Synergetic effects by combination of different elicitors or with other strategies are also included. Besides, the transgenic system has promising prospects to increase bioactive compounds content by introducing their biosynthetic or regulatory genes into medicinal plant hairy root. It offers great potential to further increase secondary metabolites yield by the integration of manipulating pathway genes with elicitors and other strategies. Then advances on two valuable pharmaceuticals production in the hairy root cultures are illustrated in detail. Finally, successful production of bioactive compounds by hairy root culture in bioreactors are introduced."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College, No.151 Malianwa North Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Caili", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &amp; Peking Union Medical College, No.151 Malianwa North Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meizhen", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "SupplMeshList": ["Agrobacterium rhizogenes"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bioreactors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32416672", "10.2174/1389201021666200516155146", "CPB-EPUB-106673"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
