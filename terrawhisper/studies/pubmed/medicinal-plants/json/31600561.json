Ancient Asian systems such as traditional Chinese medicine, Japanese Kampo medicine, and Indian Ayurvedic medicine, as well as African traditional medicine and many others have identified numerous plants reported anecdotally to treat diabetes; there are probably more than 800 such plants for which there is scientific evidence for their activity, mostly from studies using various models of diabetes in experimental animals.", "Rather than a comprehensive coverage of the literature, this article aims to identify discrepancies between findings in animal and human studies, and to highlight some of the problems in developing plant extract-based medicines that lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes, as well as to suggest potential ways forward.", "In addition to searching the 2018 PubMed literature using the terms 'extract AND blood glucose, a search of the whole literature was conducted using the terms 'plant extracts' AND 'blood glucose' AND 'diabetes' AND 'double blind' with 'clinical trials' as a filter. A third search using PubMed and Medline was undertaken for systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating the effects of plant extracts on blood glucose/glycosylated haemoglobin in patients with relevant metabolic pathologies.", "Despite numerous animal studies demonstrating the effects of plant extracts on blood glucose, few randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted to confirm efficacy in treating humans with diabetes; there have been only a small number of systematic reviews with meta-analyses of clinical studies. Qualitative and quantitative discrepancies between animal and human clinical studies in some cases were marked; the factors contributing to this included variations in the products among different studies, the doses used, differences between animal models and the human disease, and the impact of concomitant therapy in patients, as well as differences in the duration of treatment, and the fact that treatment in animals may begin before or very soon after the induction of diabetes.", "The potential afforded by natural products has not yet been realised in the context of treating diabetes mellitus. A systematic, coordinated, international effort is required to achieve the goal of providing anti-diabetic treatments derived from medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
