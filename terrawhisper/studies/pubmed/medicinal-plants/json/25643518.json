Different concentrations (100-500 ppm) of the methanolic extracts of the plants were tested towards larval mortality and development of C. pipiens separately. Larval mortalities were counted at 2, 4 & 10 days after treatment. Egg hatchability was determined at 4 & 7 days after treatment. Successful pupation and adult emergence percentage were recorded daily till all control adults emerged. All plants extracts exhibited variable activities. The greatest effect was with R. chalepensis which showed acute (2 days) and chronic (10 days) LC50 of 132.6 & 96.56 ppm, respectively. Larval mortality up to 84.47% &85.53%, were observed with C. paradoxa and R. Chalepensis respectively. Egg hatch was significantly reduced about equal with R. chalepensis and W. somnifera extracts. Concentration levels of C. paradoxa (\u2265200 ppm) and H. longiflorum (>400 ppm) showed significant hindrance to the larval development and reduction to resulting pupae and adults. Drastic development retardation was shown with extract of C. paradoxa leaves (300 ppm), but only 15.3% & 5.6% of larvae reach pupal and adult stages respectively. The larvicidal activity of methanolic extracts of R. chalepensis, W somnifera, C. paradoxa, H. longiflorum proved to be effective against C. pipiens larvae without any human or animal risk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Sattar", "ForeName": "Essami", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zaitoon", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El Sayed", "ForeName": "Abeer M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bakhashwain", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Egypt", "MedlineTA": "J Egypt Soc Parasitol", "NlmUniqueID": "8102141", "ISSNLinking": "1110-0583"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Culex"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25643518", "10.12816/0007880"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
