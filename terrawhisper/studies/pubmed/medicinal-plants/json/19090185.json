Tropical forest trees belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, R. heudelotii is used by the local population in traditional medicine and as lipidic source. Fruits randomly harvested in these three localities have revealed six types namely: one new type constitute of four seeded fruit with four lobes and five previous type constitute of single seeded fruit with one lobe; single seeded fruit with one aborted lobe; two seeded fruit with two lobes; two seeded fruit with unequally developed lobes; three seeded fruit with three lobes. This variability is expressed by differences at the level of morphological parameters (mass of fruit and seed) and physical parameters (thickness of shell, ratio of longitudinal diameter and cross diameter section of seeds, capacity to liberate almonds). Analyses of variance, correlation and principal component have showed that, seeds extracted from fruits of Mbalmayo have shell thicker whereby those of Santchou liberate much shell. In the same way, accession of Mbalmayo has a total mass for 1500 fruits estimated 1.5 times superior to those of Balamba and 1.19 time superior to those of Santchou. In fact, study of morpho-physical parameter shows that to choose the fruits having a high capacity to liberate almond, ellipsoid-oblate form of the seeds and thickness of shell are good indicators and for this effect, accession of Santchou is recommended. Accessions of Balamba and Santchou having less rate of seed abortion are more productive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Botanic and Traditional Medicine, Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies (IMPM) P.O.
