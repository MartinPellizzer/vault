In China, medicinal plants from ancient to modern history have been used in patients with angina pectoris, congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic hypertension, arrhythmia, and venous insufficiency for centuries. The latest increase in the fame of natural products and alternative medicine has revived interest in conventional remedies that have been consumed in the management of CVD.\u00a0The cardio-protective properties of the various herbs are possibly due to their anti-oxidative, antihypercholesterolemic, anti-ischemic activities, and inhibition of platelet aggregation that reduce the risk of CVD.\u00a0Ethno-pharmacological and biological properties of these plants are explored, based upon published scientific literature. Although a majority of medicinal plants having a biological mechanism that linked with CVD management, to date, published literature pertaining to their promising scientific properties are still poorly understood. Compared with synthetic medicines, alternative medicines do not need scientific studies before their formal approval from the government sector and due to this purpose; their safety, as well as efficacy, still remain elusive. Taken together, we addressed all accessible evidence on alternative medicines commonly consumed in CVD management. Our comprehensive analysis of the scientific literature indicated that many TCMs are available and valuable herbal medication would be the best alternative for the management of CVD as a complementary therapy. Furthermore, practitioners should always discuss possible benefits-risks of alternative medicines with patients so that they are aware of the consumption of alternative medications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 211166, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Naveed", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 211166, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Majeed", "ForeName": "Fatima", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 211166, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Taleb", "ForeName": "Abdoh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 211166, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Zubair", "ForeName": "Hafiz Muhammad", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Riphah Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Riphah International University, Punjab Province, Lahore 54770, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shumzaid", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 211198, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Farooq", "ForeName": "Muhammad Asim", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Sciences, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210093, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Baig", "ForeName": "Mirza Muhammad Faran Ashraf", "Initials": "MMFA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing 210093, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Animal Production and Technology, The Cholistan University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Bahawalpur 6300, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Anatomy, Medical College of Qinghai University, Xining 810000, Qinghai Province, P.
