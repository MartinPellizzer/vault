New drug research and development are imminent. This article reviews the research on small-molecule drugs for vitiligo from 1990 to 2021 at home and abroad. They are classified according to their structures and mechanisms of action, including natural products and derivatives, anti-oxidative stress drugs, immunosuppressants, prostaglandins, etc. The research on their anti-vitiligo activity, structural modification, new dosage forms, clinical trials, and the development trend in new anti-vitiligo drugs are reviewed, which provides important references for the development of new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang indigenous medicinal plants resource utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of \u00dcr\u00fcmqi China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Heng", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang indigenous medicinal plants resource utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of \u00dcr\u00fcmqi China."}], "LastName": "Niu", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics & Chemistry State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang indigenous medicinal plants resource utilization, CAS Key Laboratory of Chemistry of Plant Resources in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of \u00dcr\u00fcmqi China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["36786141", "10.2174/0929867330666230214103054", "CMC-EPUB-129498"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
