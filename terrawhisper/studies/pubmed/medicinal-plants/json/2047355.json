In Experiment 1, S. macrocarpa Muhl. seed levels of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5% were added to a basal diet at the expense of filler and fed to five replicate groups of six 58-wk-old paired quail (one male and one female). Average daily feed consumption, hen-day egg production, average BW change, mortality, fertility, and hatchability were monitored. Four groups of eight individually caged females, 63 wk of age, were each given a diet containing 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10% ground S. macrocarpa Muhl. seed in Experiment 2. A seventh treatment was added that consisted of 10% ground S. macrocarpa Muhl. from an older seed shipment used previously in work with White Leghorn hens. Increasing S. macrocarpa Muhl. seed levels in Experiment 1 did not cause significant deviations from the control treatment for average daily feed consumption, BW change, hen-day egg production, fertility, total hatchability, or hatchability of fertile eggs. In Experiment 2 neither average daily feed consumption nor hen-day egg production were affected by seed level or source. Quail given the 10% seed level using the older seed shipment had a significantly greater weight loss than the control birds. With the exception of this greater weight loss and in contrast with work involving chickens, dietary levels of ground S. macrocarpa Muhl. seed of up to 10% were acceptable to bobwhite quail."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Poultry Science, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611."}], "LastName": "Flunker", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Damron", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilson", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Colinus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mortality"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2047355", "10.3382/ps.0700658", "S0032-5791(19)33128-1"]}}]}
