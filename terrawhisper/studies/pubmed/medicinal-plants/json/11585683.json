They are found in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world, where, for centuries, they have been used traditionally to cure ailments and diseases. Sometimes they are prescribed for the same medicinal purpose. This would suggest that they contain a common ingredient. Phytochemical analysis has recently yielded a vast array of compounds, including more than 150 different alkaloids. These are of the Amaryllidaceae type, whose most noted effects are: analgesic, anticholinergic, antitumour and antiviral. Even though much has been reported on the medicinal properties of Crinum, only an estimated 20% of the species worldwide are represented in these analyses, as reviewed in this paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre for Plant Growth and Development, School of Botany and Zoology, Faculty of Science and Agriculture, University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg, Private Bag X01, 3209, Scottsville, South Africa."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fennell", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "van Staden", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "115"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11585683", "10.1016/s0378-8741(01)00305-1", "S0378874101003051"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
