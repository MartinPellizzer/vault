Historically, ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPP) was considered the sole precursor in DAs biosynthesis. However, the recent discovery of ent-8,13-CPP synthase in A. gymnandrum Maxim., which participates in ent-atiserene biosynthesis, raises the question of whether this gene is conserved throughout the Aconitum genus. In this study, RNA sequencing and PacBio Iso-sequencing were employed to identify diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in four additional Aconitum species with distinct DA compositions. In vitro and in vivo analyses functionally characterized a diverse array of 10 class II and 9 class I diTPSs. In addition to the identification of seven class II diTPSs as ent-CPP synthases, three other synthases generating ent-8,13-CPP, 8,13-CPP, and 8\u03b1-hydroxy-CPP were also discovered. Four class I kaurene synthases-like (KSLs) were observed to react with ent-CPP to yield ent-kaurene. Three KSLs not only reacted with ent-CPP but also ent-8,13-CPP to produce ent-atiserene. AsiKSL2-1 was found to react with 8\u03b1-hydroxy-CPP to produce Z-abienol and AsiKSL2-2 exhibited no activity with any of the four intermediates. This research delineates the known diterpene biosynthesis pathways in six Aconitum species and explores the highly divergent diterpene synthases within the genus, which are consistent with their phylogeny and may be responsible for the differential distribution of diterpenoid alkaloids in root and aerial parts. These findings contribute valuable insights into the diversification of diterpene biosynthesis and establish a solid foundation for future investigation into DA biosynthetic pathways in Aconitum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
