Several \u03b1\u2011glucosidase inhibitors have been used as medicines for type 2 diabetes, but a similar effect is observed in natural resources, including traditional herbs and their phytochemicals. To identify the presence of the \u03b1\u2011glucosidase inhibitory activity in herbs, in which various functional effects have been known to occur, the present study investigated the effects of hot\u2011water extracts of 26\u00a0types of herbs on \u03b1\u2011glucosidase activity in an in\u00a0vitro assay. The results indicated significant increases in the inhibition of \u03b1\u2011glucosidase activity in 1,000\u00a0\u00b5g/ml olive (P<0.01), white willow (P<0.01) and red rooibos hot\u2011water extracts. Furthermore, \u226550% inhibition of \u03b1\u2011glucosidase activity was determined to be significant in 1,000\u00a0\u00b5g/ml coltsfoot, green tea and bearberry hot\u2011water extracts. In addition, the effects of bearberry, green tea and coltsfoot hot\u2011water extracts on \u03b1\u2011glucosidase activity in\u00a0vivo were evaluated according to the blood glucose levels (BGLs) in maltose and glucose load model rats. It was indicated that the administration of these three herb extracts significantly reduced the increasing BGLs after maltose loading until 0.5\u00a0h compared with the control group. However, only coltsfoot extract significantly reduced the increasing BGLs after glucose loading until 0.5\u00a0h compared with the control group. Thus, the present results may facilitate the understanding of a novel functionality in traditional herbs, which could be useful for the prevention of disease onset and progression, such as in hyperglycemia and type\u00a02 diabetes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "Hidetomo", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Toyoda", "ForeName": "Nana", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ezawa", "ForeName": "Satoko", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "Shiori", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hibino", "ForeName": "Yasuhide", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "SunagaLaboratory of Pharmacotherapy, Clinical Dietetics and Human Nutrition, Master's Program, Josai University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sakado, Saitama 350\u20110295, Japan."}], "LastName": "Sunaga", "ForeName": "Katsuyoshi", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "69-79-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Maltose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.20", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Glucosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arctostaphylos"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aspalathus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maltose"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Olea"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salix"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tussilago"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Glucosidases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32945423", "10.3892/mmr.2020.11397"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
