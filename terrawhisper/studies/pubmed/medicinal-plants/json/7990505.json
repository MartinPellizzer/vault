P. emblica elicited a 2-fold increase in splenic NK cell activity on day 3 post tumor inoculation. Enhanced activity was highly significant on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 after tumor inoculation with respect to the untreated tumor bearing control. A significant enhancement in ADCC was documented on days 3, 7, 9, 11 and 13 in drug treated mice as compared to the control. An increase in life span (ILS) of 35% was recorded in tumor bearing mice treated with P. emblica. This increased survival was completely abrogated when NK cell and killer (K) cell activities were depleted either by cyclophosphamide or anti-asialo-GM1 antibody treatment. These results indicate: (a) an absolute requirement for a functional NK cell or K cell population in order that P. emblica can exert its effect on tumor bearing animals, and (b) the antitumor activity of P. emblica is mediated primarily through the ability of the drug to augment natural cell mediated cytotoxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore."}], "LastName": "Suresh", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vasudevan", "ForeName": "D M", "Initials": "DM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphoma, T-Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7990505", "10.1016/0378-8741(94)90099-x", "0378-8741(94)90099-X"]}}]}
