Secondly, a quantitative 1HNMR method was established for the simultaneous determination of major constituents in QSYQ samples. In addition, an HPLC method was performed to verify the results obtained by the quantitative proton NMR (qHNMR)\u00a0 method.", "In the present study, 26 metabolites were identified in the 1HNMR spectra of QSYQ. In addition, a rapid and accruate qHNMR method was established for the simultaneous determination of protocatechualdehyde, rosmarinic acid, danshensu, calycosin-7-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside, and ononin in ten batches of QSYQ samples for the first time. Moreover, the proposed qHNMR method and HPLC method were compared using Bland-Altman and plots Passing-Bablok regression, indicating no significant differences and a strong correlation between the two analytical methods.", "This method is an important tool for the identification and quantification of major constituents in QSYQ.", "Compared with traditional HPLC, the established qHNMR method has the advantages of simple sample preparation, short analysis time, and non-destructive analysis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.
