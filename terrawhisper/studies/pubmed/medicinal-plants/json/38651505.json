Previous studies have shown that species of the genus <i>Capparis,</i> contain several classes of secondary metabolites, including sterols. In this study, the leaves of <i>C. fascicularis</i> were extracted with 80% aqueous methanol, and the extract's fractions were screened for antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 25923 using a broth micro-dilution assay. The hexane fraction was the most active, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 512\u2009\u00b5g/mL. TLC-DB and flash column chromatography of the hexane fraction resulted in the isolation of \u03b2-Sitosterol for the first time from <i>C. fascicularis</i>. The compound was characterised using NMR and HRMS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Eswatini."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Malawi University of Science and Technology, Limbe, Malawi."}], "LastName": "Muwanya", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eswatini Institute for Research in Traditional Medicine, Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants, University of Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Eswatini."}], "LastName": "Sibandze", "ForeName": "Gugu F", "Initials": "GF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Eswatini Institute for Research in Traditional Medicine, Medicinal and Indigenous Food Plants, University of Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Eswatini."}], "LastName": "Dludlu", "ForeName": "Meshack N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9564-6979"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Engineering, University of Eswatini, Kwaluseni, Eswatini."}], "LastName": "Simelane", "ForeName": "Sandile B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38651505", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2345753"]}}]}
