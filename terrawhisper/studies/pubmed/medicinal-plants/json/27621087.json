Species from the genus Globularia (Plantaginaceae) are known as sources of different phenolic and iridoid compounds. Globularia alypum L. is a medicinal plant used as a healing agent in many Mediterranean countries. Similarities in phytochemical composition are often observed for related species. For Globularia spp., such findings were mostly based on identification of several isolated compounds from distinct species. To our knowledge, this is the first study that enables simultaneous comparison of phytochemical profiles from several members of the genus Globularia. Liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used for the analysis of methanolic extracts of aerial parts obtained from four Globularia species (G.\u2009alypum, G.\u2009punctata, G.\u2009cordifolia and G.\u2009meridionalis). In total, 85 compounds were identified or tentatively identified based on comparison of their retention time, UV and MS<sup>n</sup> (up to MS<sup>4</sup> ) spectra to those of standard compounds and/or to literature data. Among these, high relative amounts of bioactive molecules such as globularin, globularifolin, asperuloside and verbascoside (acteoside) were found. Apart from providing new insights into the phytochemistry and chemotaxonomy of selected Globularia species, results of this study complement existing MS/MS spectral data and could enable easier mass spectrometric profiling of certain bioactive compounds such as iridoids and phenylethanoids in related plant species, genera and families.
