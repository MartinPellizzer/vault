Another group was normal control groups (stomach perfused with drinking water). In the end of 12 weeks, the liver specimen of each rat was observed by anglicizing its tissue damage, and all data collected was performed by statistical analysis in quantum and semi-quantum. Meanwhile cytokines gene express of each group is determined.", "In the end of 12 weeks, alcoholic hepatitis appeared in rat liver. Hepatic injury in alcohol group and TP group were found, but could not be found in normal group. Compared with pure alcohol group, alcoholic liver damage mainly showing with steatosis in TP group were slight, in addition showing liver cellular swelling with small area, with less spot and focal necrosis, none bridging necrosis. Steatosis were slight relatively, mega-bubble steatosis were less found. Collagen deposition of TP group were less than those of pure alcohol group.
