Recently, the application of the liposomal delivery system in the management of skin melanoma has been widely investigated. Liposomal nanocarriers are biocompatible and less toxic to host cells, enabling the efficient and safe delivery of different therapeutic agents into the tumor site and further promoting their antitumor activities. Therefore, the liposomal delivery system effectively increases the success of current melanoma therapies and overcomes resistance. In this review, we present an overview of liposome-based targeted drug delivery methods and highlight recent advances towards the development of liposome-based carriers for therapeutic genes. We also discuss the new insights regarding the efficacy and clinical significance of combinatorial treatment of liposomal formulations with immunotherapy and conventional therapies in melanoma patients for a better understanding and successfully managing cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
