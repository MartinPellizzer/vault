The accumulation of Pb by A.\u00a0indica plants was found to be 121.6 and 17.5\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> dry weight (DW) in roots and shoots, respectively, when exposed to a Pb concentration of 500\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. The presence of Pb ions in stem, root and leaf tissues was confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses. Concerning the activity of antioxidant enzymes, viz., peroxidase (POX) catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), they were induced at various regimes during 5, 8 and 12\u00a0d of Pb exposure in both the leaves and roots than untreated controls. Lead treatment increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in both the leaf and root tissues over control, irrespective of the duration of exposure. Anew, it was observed that Pb treatments induced variations in the number and intensity of protein bands. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) results show that the Pb treatment caused genotoxicity on DNA molecules as evidenced by the amplification of new bands and the absence of normal DNA amplicons in treated plants. Results confirm that A.\u00a0indica is a Pb accumulator species, and the antioxidants might play a crucial role in the detoxification of Pb-induced toxic effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
