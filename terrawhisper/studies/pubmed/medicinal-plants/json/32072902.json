Anticancer probability is calculated by iACP server, docking of active peptides is done by CABS-dock the server.", "The anti-cancer peptides are identified with the MASCOT peptide mass fingerprinting server, the identified peptides are screened and only the anti-cancer are selected. De-novo peptide structure prediction is used for 3D structure prediction by PEP-FOLD 3 server. The docking results confirm strong bonding with the interacting amino acids of the receptor protein of breast cancer BRCA1 which shows the best peptide binding to the active chain, the human leukemia protein docking with peptides shows the accurate binding.", "These peptides are stable and functional and are the best way for the treatment of cancer and many other deadly diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioinformatics, Govt.
