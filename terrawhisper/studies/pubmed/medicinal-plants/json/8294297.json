Masticate NDF, ADF, and in vitro OM disappearance did not differ (P > .11) between forage types (average = 66.6, 36.1, and 58.8% of OM). Only N differed (P = .02) between PRAIRIE (2.1) and PASTURE (2.4% of OM). Extents of in situ OM and N disappearance were greater (P < .05) and rate of N disappearance between 12 and 36 h was slower (P < .10) from PRAIRIE than from PASTURE masticate. Based on in situ data, the ruminally degraded N: ruminally degraded OM (grams/kilogram) ratio differed (P < .05) between PRAIRIE (22) and PASTURE (25). Ruminal ammonia N concentration (milligrams/deciliter) was less (P = .02) for PRAIRIE (2.8) than for PASTURE (3.8). Forage OM intake and fecal OM output did not differ (P > .72; average = 8,207 and 3,380 g/d), but duodenal OM flow tended (P = .13) to be greater (PRAIRIE = 4,892, PASTURE = 5,170 g/d) in cattle grazing PASTURE. Apparent and true ruminal OM digestion did not differ between forage types (P > .18; average = 38.3 and 48.5%). Nitrogen intake, nonammonia N, and forage N flow at the duodenum were greater (P < .04) for PASTURE (198 vs 171, 242 vs 210, and 162 vs 135 g/d) than for PRAIRIE. Microbial N flow (average = 78 g/d) and microbial efficiency (average = 20 g of microbial N/kg of OM truly fermented) did not differ (P > .25) between forage types. Apparent and true ruminal N digestion did not differ (P > .65; average = -26.6 and 19.3%) between forage types. Flow of nonammonia N was in excess relative to digestible OM intake; hence, digestible OM intake seemed to be first-limiting for performance by cattle grazing either forage type."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station, Stillwater 74078-0102."}], "LastName": "Gunter", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McCollum", "ForeName": "F T", "Initials": "FT", "Suffix": "3rd"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gillen", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krysl", "ForeName": "L J", "Initials": "LJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8294297", "10.2527/1993.71123432x"]}}]}
