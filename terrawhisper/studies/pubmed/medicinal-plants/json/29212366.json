The new compound 1 was a rare 12-membered lactone containing a quinone ring skeleton. The structure of the 1 was elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data. The relative and absolute configurations of 1 were elucidated by the ROESY analysis and biogenesis pathway. All compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against six pathogenic bacteria in vitro. Compounds 6 and 7 exhibited potent antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus with the MIC values of 2.5 and 5\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Labortory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Ministry of Education, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Hainan Normal University , Haikou , P.
