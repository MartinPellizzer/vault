Pure cultures of organisms were grown overnight in a nutrient broth and the resultant supernatant fluid which contained microorganisms in similar numbers to those found in the patients was used as the basic solution for jejunal perfusions which were done in anesthetized adult Wistar rats. The substrate used was arbutin (p-hydroxphenyl-beta-glucoside), a recognized marker of intestinal active sugar transport. Of the gram-positive cocci studied, only the saprophyte, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, did not adversely affect the intestinal absorption of arbutin. The only gram-positive rod studied, a lactobacillus, also significantly inhibited arbutin absorption. Of the Enterobacteriaciae studied, Salmonella paratyphi B, a Shigella and Proteus sp. did not affect arbutin absorption. All the species of Escherichia coli studied, including a nonpathogenic variety, inhibited absorption. Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were also effective. Of the Candida sp., C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were inhibitory while C. tropicalis was not. These results suggest that microorganisms not generally considered enteropathogenic may adversely affect intestinal function when present in the lumen of the gut in excessive numbers and contribute to the production of diarrhea in children with malnutrition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gracey", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burke", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stone", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "C5INA23HXF", "NameOfSubstance": "Arbutin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arbutin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nutrition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1096588", "10.1093/ajcn/28.8.841"]}}]}
