Because of the deficiency in current clinical management of AIT, the need for alternative therapies is highlighted. With its multi-component and multi-target characteristics, Chinese medicine has good potential as an alternative therapy for AIT.", "The aim of this study was to systematically summarize the clinical efficacy and safety evaluation of TCM and its active ingredients in the treatment and regulation of AIT. Additionally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the relevant mechanisms and molecular targets to understand the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine on AIT and explore new ideas for clinical treatment.", "The literature related to \"Hashimoto\", \"autoimmune thyroiditis\", \"traditional Chinese medicine,\" and \"Chinese herbal medicine\" was systematically summarized and reviewed from Web of Science Core Collection, PubMed, CNKI, and other databases. Domestic and international literature were analyzed, compared, and reviewed.", "An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that herbal medicines can intervene in immunomodulation, with pharmacological effects such as antibody lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic thyroid follicular cells, regulation of intestinal flora, and regulation of estrogen and progesterone levels. The signaling pathways and molecular targets of the immunomodulatory effects of Chinese herbal medicine for AIT may include Fas/FasL, Caspase, BCL-2, and TLRs/MyD88/NF-\u03baB et al. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Chinese herbs in the treatment and management of AIT is clinically experienced, satisfactory, and safe. Future studies may evaluate the influence of herbal medicines on the occurrence and development of AIT by modulating the interaction between immune factors and conventional signaling pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
