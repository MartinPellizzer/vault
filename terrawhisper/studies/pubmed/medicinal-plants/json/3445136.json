Large numbers of calli were induced on media exhibiting better effects of induction. Supplements of 5 mg 2,4-D/1 and 1 mg KT/1 to the media proved to be much effective. Regeneration of the whole plantlets from anther culture of Panax ginseng is usually quite difficult. During the past three years, however, sixteen of the 100 medium formulae tested were proved to be suitable. The formulae of MS + 0.5 mg BA/1 + 2 mg GA/1 + 1000 mg LH/1 + 3% sucrose were considered good and effective. A visibly differentiated body, which was light-milky white and later turned into a light green spot, was formed 40 days after the callus was transferred to the differentiation media. This body differentiated subsequently into buds, roots and, eventually, seedlings. The embryoid clones have been established in order to maintain its ability of continual differentiation into plantlets through successive culturings of many generations. The test-tube ginseng thus formed were transferred to regular flowerpots and grew well. Based upon chromosome examination of the callus cells and the root tips, we tentatively affirmed that the majority of these regenerated from anther of Panax ginseng were originated from pollen cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Local Products, CAAS, Jilin."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hou", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Z M", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Q Q", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Z G", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Z T", "Initials": "ZT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sci Sin B", "NlmUniqueID": "8209875", "ISSNLinking": "0253-5823"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3445136"]}}]}
