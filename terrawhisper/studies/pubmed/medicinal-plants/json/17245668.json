However, its scientific basis as a functional food is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary dehulled adlay on plasma lipid and glucose concentrations in diabetic rats. The diabetic male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, induced by injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg subcutaneously), were fed a cholesterol-rich diet (0.5% cholesterol) containing corn starch or dehulled adlay for four weeks. After completion of the experimental period, the abdominal adipose tissue and liver of rats were excised and weighed, and the plasma glucose, triglyceride, and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were assayed. The results showed that diabetic rats fed a dehulled adlay diet exhibited a greater adipose tissue weight (9.36 +/- 3.43 vs. 5.39 +/- 3.04 g, p < 0.05) and a reduced food intake (39.3 +/- 5.9 vs. 61.0 +/- 11.7 g/day, p < 0.05) when compared with animals fed a cornstarch diet. Significantly decreased plasma glucose (261.6 +/- 96.6 vs. 422.1 +/- 125.4 mg/dL, p < 0.05), total cholesterol (289.4 +/- 140.6 vs. 627.3 +/- 230.5 mg/dL, p < 0.05), and triglyceride (52.3 +/- 14.4 vs. 96.5 +/- 36.6 mg/dL, p < 0.05) levels were observed in rats fed the dehulled adlay diet. In addition, the ingestion of dehulled adlay appears to significantly decrease plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plus very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol concentrations. Rats fed a dehulled adlay diet showed an increase in fecal weight and cholesterol contents of stools. Although a significantly decreased plasma thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) value was observed in diabetic rats fed the dehulled adlay diet (6.2 +/- 3.4 vs. 11.0 +/- 3.8 nmol malondialdehyde (MDA)/mL, p < 0.05), no significant difference in the hepatic TBARS value was observed between the two dietary groups. Results from the present study suggest that dehulled adlay exhibited not only a hypolipidemic effect but also displayed a hypoglycemic ability in diabetic rats, indicating that dehulled adlay may play an important role in the regulation of plasma lipid and glucose metabolisms in diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Ching Kuo Institute of Management and Health, Keelung, Taiwan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yeh", "ForeName": "Pao-Hua", "Initials": "PH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Wenchang", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "Meng-Tsan", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int J Vitam Nutr Res", "NlmUniqueID": "1273304", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol, VLDL"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5W494URQ81", "NameOfSubstance": "Streptozocin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, LDL"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol, VLDL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coix"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "diet therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid A"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Streptozocin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "25", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17245668", "10.1024/0300-9831.76.5.299"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
