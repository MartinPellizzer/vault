Present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 43 kD protein isolated from the leaves of this herb against chloroform induced hepatotoxicity. Male albino mice were intraperitoneally treated with 2 mg/kg body weight of the protein for 5 days followed by oral application of chloroform (0.75 ml/kg body weight) for 2 days. Different biochemical parameters related to physiology and pathophysiology of liver, such as, serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were determined in the murine sera under various experimental conditions. Direct antioxidant role of the protein was also determined from its reaction with Diphenyl picryl hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide. To find out the mode of action of this protein against chloroform induced liver damage, levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase were measured from liver homogenates. Peroxidation of membrane lipids both in vivo and in vitro were also measured as malonaldialdehyde. Finally, histopathological analyses were done from liver sections of control, toxin treated and protein pre- and post-treated (along with the toxin) mice. Levels of serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, which showed an elevation in chloroform induced hepatic damage, were brought down near to the normal levels with the protein pretreatment. On the contrary, the levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione-S-transferase that had gone down in mice orally fed with chloroform were significantly elevated in protein pretreated ones. Besides, chloroform induced lipid peroxidation was effectively reduced by protein treatment both in vivo and in vitro. In cell free system the protein effectively quenched diphenyl picryl hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical, though it could not catalyse the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide. Post treatment with the protein for 3 days after 2 days of chloroform administration showed similar results. Histopathological studies indicated that chloroform induced extensive tissue damage was less severe in the mice livers treated with the 43 kD protein prior and post to the toxin administration. Results from all these data suggest that the protein possesses both preventive and curative role against chloroform induced hepatotoxicity and probably acts by an anti-oxidative defense mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Bose Institute, 93/1, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Kolkata-700009, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Ayantika", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarkar", "ForeName": "Kasturi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sil", "ForeName": "Parames C", "Initials": "PC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9702084", "ISSNLinking": "1225-8687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7V31YC746X", "NameOfSubstance": "Chloroform"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alanine Transaminase"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cajanus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chloroform"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16584636", "10.5483/bmbrep.2006.39.2.197"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
