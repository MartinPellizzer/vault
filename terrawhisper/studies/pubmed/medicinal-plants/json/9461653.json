Treatment of the same extract with chlorine solution yielded four diasteromeric 2\",3\"-dichlorocephalomannines, with no 7-epimers. The diastereomeric mixtures were separated into the individual components by preparative HPLC on C18 reversed-phase silica gel. A more efficient analytical separation was obtained on a pentafluorophenyl-bonded phase. These reaction products were isolated and fully identified spectroscopically. Slight differences were observed in the NMR spectra of the 7-epimers when compared to their 7 beta-OH analogues. On the basis of a comparison of physicochemical data, the bromo compounds were identified as (2\"R,3\"S)-dibromo-7-epi-cephalomannine (3), (2\"S,3\"R)-dibromo-7-epi-cephalomannine (4), (2\"R,3\"S)-dibromocephalomannine (5), and (2\"S,3\"R)-dibromocephalomannine (6), and the chloro compounds as (2\"R,3\"R)-dichlorocephalomannine (7), (2\"S,3\"S)-dichlorocephalomannine (8), (2\"R,3\"S)-dichlorocephalomannine (9), and (2\"S,3\"R)-dichlorocephalomannine (10). Cytotoxic activity was tested against the NCI 60 human tumor cell line panel in comparison with paclitaxel (1), and encouraging results were obtained in some cases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xechem, Inc., Research Laboratories, New Brunswick, New Jersey 08901-3279, USA."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "R C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yankov", "ForeName": "L K", "Initials": "LK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Poulev", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Caccamese", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SBV4XY874G", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Bromine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemical synthesis", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9461653", "10.1021/np970266s", "np970266s"]}}]}
