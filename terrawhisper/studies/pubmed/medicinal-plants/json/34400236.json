Other contributions address the holistic benefit of herbal medicines and their multi-targeted actions, which improve brain function in diverse cellular and animal models of brain injury. Not only are new targets for nutraceuticals reported, but their benefits on neurobehavioural problems are elucidated in conditions as diverse as obesity and menopause. Inflammation in neuropathologies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), remains a huge focus and diverse nutraceuticals demonstrate therapeutic applicability via glial-mediated actions. While contrary actions should be borne in mind in the search for novel neurotherapeutics, the great promise offered by herbal medicines and their newly identified active principles offers unique options for the management of diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
