HTg is usually a part of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and dyslipidemia. Different medications have been used to treat HTg but experimentally, many herbs have been recommended for treating HTg as an adjuvant therapy. In most cases, the recommendations are based on animal studies and limited evidences exist about their mechanisms and clinical usefulness.", "This review focused on the herbs which have been shown TG lowering effect.", "The search was done in PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases a 20-year period between 1997 to 2017 with keywords search of medicinal plant, plant extract, hypertriglyceridemia, dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia, lipoprotein lipase and apolipoprotein.", "According to the results, many plants showed positive effects but Allium sativum, Nigella sativa, Curcuma longa, Anethum graveolens and Commiphora mukul had the best TG lowering effect with exact mechanisms of action.", "It seems that use of these plants as complementary therapeutics or extraction of their active ingredients along with currently available drugs will improve the management of HTg in patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
