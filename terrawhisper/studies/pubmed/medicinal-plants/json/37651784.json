Results showed that the modified RAE-based film kept better shrimp quality compared with natural RAE-based film in terms of determined biochemical parameters and estimated shelf-life. Totally, 49 differentially abundance proteins (DAPs) were identified compared with shrimp without packaging. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the modified RAE-based film could maintain functional DAPs which were mainly distributed in the binding, catalytic activity, etc., and metabolic signaling pathways like melanogenesis signaling pathway were remarkably enriched. Meanwhile, there were 25 DAPs showing close relationship with quality traits, and some of them, such as myosin chains, troponin I and heat shock protein were considered as the potential biomarkers to evaluate shrimp quality deterioration. In conclusion, this study revealed the preservation mechanism of modified RAE-based active film on shrimp quality at the protein molecular level."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
