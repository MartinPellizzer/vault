This systematic review aims to shed light on gigantol's promising role in inflammation treatment and its underlying mechanisms. Gigantol exhibits potential anti-inflammatory properties in pre-clinical pharmacological test systems. It effectively reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory markers and arachidonic acid metabolites through various pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, AKT, PI3K, and JNK/cPLA2/12-LOX. The in-silico investigations demonstrated that the MMP-13 enzyme served as the most promising target for gigantol with highest binding affinity (docking score = -8.8\u2009kcal/mol). Encouragingly, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analysis of gigantol confirmed its compatibility with the necessary physiochemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxicity properties, bolstering its potential as a drug candidate. Gigantol, with its well-documented anti-inflammatory properties, could be a promising agent for treating inflammation in the near future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioluster Research Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Chowdhury", "ForeName": "Raihan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioluster Research Center, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Bhuia", "ForeName": "Shimul", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Rakib", "ForeName": "Asraful Islam", "Initials": "AI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Al Hasan", "ForeName": "Sakib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Shill", "ForeName": "Manik Chandra", "Initials": "MC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Nashar", "ForeName": "Heba A S", "Initials": "HAS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El-Shazly", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Science and Technology University, Gopalganj, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Muhammad Torequl", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38623737", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2340042"]}}]}
