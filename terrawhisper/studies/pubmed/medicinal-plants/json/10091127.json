S. Eleven species of Astragalus and Oxytropis (and many varieties within these species) cause locoism. Many locoweed species are endemic and are restricted to a narrow niche or habitat. Other locoweed species experience extreme population cycles; the population explodes in wet years and dies off in drought. A few species, such as O. sericea, are relatively stable and cause persistent poisoning problems. Knowledge of where locoweeds grow and the environmental conditions when they become a threat is important to manage livestock and avoid poisoning. Locoweeds are relatively palatable. Many locoweeds are the first plants to begin growth in the spring and regrow in the fall. Livestock generally prefer the green-growing locoweeds to other forage that is dormant in the late fall, winter, and spring. The most effective management strategy is to deny livestock access to locoweeds during critical periods when they are more palatable than the associated forage. Herbicides can control existing locoweed populations and provide \"safe\" pastures for critical periods. However, locoweed seed in soil will germinate and re-establish when environmental condition are favorable. Good range management and wise grazing strategies can provide adequate forage for livestock and prevent them from grazing locoweed during non-critical periods of the year when it is relatively less palatable than associated forages."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "USDA/Agriculture Research Service, Poisonous Plant Research Lab., Logan, UT 84341, USA. mralphs@cc.usu.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ralphs", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "James", "ForeName": "L F", "Initials": "LF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Toxins", "NlmUniqueID": "9208016", "ISSNLinking": "1058-8108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Domestic"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United States"}], "NumberOfReferences": "42"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10091127"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
