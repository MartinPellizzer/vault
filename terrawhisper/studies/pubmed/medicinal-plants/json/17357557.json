The acute blood-stasis model rats were made by Injection of adrenaline hydrochloride along with stimulation by ice water. The effects of cough relieving and sputum elimination were observed by the ammonia water-induced tussive mice and excretion of phenol red in the airway of mice. The maximum tolerance dose of rhizoma A. chinensis was also determined during the acute toxicity test.", "The data were analyzed for statistical significance by t-test, which shows that the decoction of rhizoma A. chinensis is significantly effective in reducing the frequency of licking behavior of mice on hot-plate and writhing response induced by acetic acid, improving the hemarheology of acute blood-stasis model rats, prolonging the latent period, reducing the frequency of cough induced byammonia, and in increasing the quantity of phenol red output from the trachea in mice.
