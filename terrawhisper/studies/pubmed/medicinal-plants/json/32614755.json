The genus Commiphora emerged as a potential medicinal source with huge benefits as evidenced through its use in various traditional and modern systems of medicine. Therefore, we aimed to prepare a concise review on the pharmacological activities and the indigenous uses of various plant species belonging to the genus Commiphora along with the structural information of various active botanical ingredients present in these plants based on the published literatures and scientific reports. To collect the published literatures on Commiphora in various journals; to study and classify the available information on the pharmacological uses and chemical constituents; and to present the gathered information as a precise review to serve as a potential reference for future research. Pharmacological and phytochemical data on Commiphora plant species were collected from various journals, books, reference materials, websites including scientific databases, etc. for compilation. This review article describes the various pharmacological properties of plants of Commiphora species viz., anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, antibacterial, anti-coagulant, antidicrocoeliasis, anti-epileptic, anti-fascioliasis, anti-fungal, anti-heterophyidiasis, anti-hypercholesterolemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-hypothyroidism, anti-obesity, anti-osteoarthritic, antiosteoclastogenesis, anti-oxidant, anti-parasitic, anti-pyretic, anti-schistosomiasis, anti-septic, antithrombotic, anti-ulcer, cardioprotective, COX enzyme inhibitory, cytotoxic /anti-carcinogenic/anticancer, DNA cleavage, hypotensive, inhibits lipid peroxidation, inhibits NO and NO synthase production, insecticidal, local anesthetic, molluscicidal, smooth muscle relaxant, and tick repellent activities along with toxicity studies. Furthermore, the review also included various secondary metabolites isolated from various species of Commiphora genus along with their chemical structures serving as a ready resource for researchers. We conclude that the plant species belonging to the genus Commiphora possesses abundant pharmacological properties with a huge treasure of diverse secondary metabolites within themselves. This review indicates the necessity of further in-depth research, pre-clinical, and clinical studies with Commiphora genus, which may help to detect the unidentified potential of the Commiphora plant species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology & Centre for Excellence in Nanobio Translational Research, Anna University, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology Campus, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Latha", "ForeName": "Subbiah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology & Centre for Excellence in Nanobio Translational Research, Anna University, Bharathidasan Institute of Technology Campus, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Selvamani", "ForeName": "Palanisamy", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Nandha College of Pharmacy, Koorapalayam Pirivu, Pitchandam Palayam Post, Erode, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Prabha", "ForeName": "Thangavelu", "Initials": "T"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ST(TN)/R&amp;D/2K6/479", "Agency": "Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST), Government of Tamil Nadu", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101266881", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5257"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Commiphora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32614755", "10.2174/1871525718666200702125558", "CHAMC-EPUB-107849"]}}]}
