MS is an immune-mediated, inflammatory neurological disease affecting the CNS. As part of its attack on the axons of the CNS, MS witnesses varying degrees of myelin and axonal loss. A total of about 20 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are available today that, both in clinical trials and in real-world studies, reduce disease activity, such as relapses, magnetic resonance imaging lesions, and disability accumulation. Currently, the world is facing an outbreak of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly around the globe. Viral infections play an important role in triggering and maintaining neuroinflammation through direct and indirect mechanisms. There is an old association between MS and viral infections. In the context of MS-related chronic inflammatory damage within the CNS, there has been concern regarding COVID-19 worsening neurological damage. A high rate of disability and increased susceptibility to infection have made MS patients particularly vulnerable. In addition, DMTs have been a concern during the pandemic since many DMTs have immunosuppressive properties. In this article, we discuss the impact of DMTs on COVID-19 risks and the effect of DMTs on COVID-19 vaccination efficacy and outcome in MS patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Peyvand Pathobiology and Genetic Laboratory, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamali", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Science Foundation Ireland (SFI), Center for Research in Medical Devices (C\u00daRAM), University of Galway, Galway, Ireland."}], "LastName": "Shapoori", "ForeName": "Shima", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiraz Neuroscience Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurosurgery, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farrokhi", "ForeName": "Majid Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infertility Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vakili", "ForeName": "Sina", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5528-1984"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut, USA."}], "LastName": "Rostamzadeh", "ForeName": "Davoud", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiraz Neuroscience Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iravanpour", "ForeName": "Farideh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiraz Neuroscience Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tavakoli Oliaee", "ForeName": "Razieh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3272-448X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shiraz Neuroscience Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafarinia", "ForeName": "Morteza", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Viral Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "8801552", "ISSNLinking": "0882-8245"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "COVID-19 Vaccines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Vaccines"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "5", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "27"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37276047", "10.1089/vim.2023.0035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
