Current treatment options are not ideal, due to unwanted side effects and increasing resistance and availability is often limited in developing countries. Medicinal plants continue to attract attention because of their beneficial effects in the prevention or/and accelerating the healing process of various diseases. In this study, in vitro and in vivo susceptibility of L. major to Veronica persica Poir. extract, a medicinal plant with many applications, has been evaluated. Antileishmanial activity of plant extract was investigated both on cultured L. major promastigotes and in mice challenged with L. major. Animals were divided into three groups including control (without any treatment), test (treated with plant extract) and glucantime (the reference drug) treated groups. After treatments, skin lesion sizes and body weights of animals were checked during 4 weeks. The potential of the plant extract in decreasing the number of parasites in spleen cells of animals as well as inducing the nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophage cells was also investigated. In vitro tests showed that the plant extract was able to reduce the survival time of promastigotes in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo experiments also revealed a significant influence of V. persica extracts on accelerating the healing process as well as reducing the overall disease burden in animal model by inducing NO production in macrophage cells. Our findings indicated the promising potential of V. persica extract as an ideal candidate in the treatment of CL caused by L. major."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roointan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA."}], "LastName": "Setzer", "ForeName": "William N", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Milan State University, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Iriti", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Ethics and Law Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Bahare", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Leishmania major"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Veronica"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29981682"]}}]}
