The extract relaxed vanadate-induced contractions on rat uterus incubated in a calcium free solution (EC50 = 11.41 +/- 1.38 micrograms/ml). The modification of the effect by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), a protein kinase A inhibitor (TPCK), calcium modifying drugs, and drugs interfering with transcription and protein synthesis has been assayed. The effect was unmodified by a 3 microM concentration of indomethacin, (EC50 = 8.77 +/- 1.28 vs 11.41 +/- 1.38 micrograms/ml) and a 5 micrograms/ml concentration of the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, (EC50 = 8.23 +/- 2.19 vs 11.41 +/- 1.38 micrograms/ml). The inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization TMB-8 (0.1 mM), the Na+/Ca+2 exchanger inhibitor amiloride (0.1 mM), the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM (50 microM), the PKA inhibitor TPCK (10 microM), and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) significantly shifted to the right the dose-response curve of the extract (EC50 = 17.83 +/- 1.87 micrograms/ml, 18.61 +/- 2.50 micrograms/ml, 35.28 +/- 9.13 micrograms/ml, 33.99 +/- 3.07 micrograms/ml, and 27.31 +/- 4.93 micrograms/ml, respectively, vs 11.41 +/- 1.38 micrograms/ml). These results suggest that the effect of the lipidic extract from S. serrulata fruits could be partially due to Na+/Ca+2 exchanger activation and interference with intracellular calcium mobilization, and point to cAMP as a possible mediator. Moreover, protein synthesis seems to be involved in the spasmolytic activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratorio de Farmacolog\u00eda, Departamento de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Oviedo, Spain."}], "LastName": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hidalgo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cantabrana", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9000882", "10.1055/s-2006-957958"]}}]}
