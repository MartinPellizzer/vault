Despite extensive scientific research advances, available disease-modifying treatment strategies remained limited; thus, increasing demand for new drugs. In recent years, medicinal plants attracted attention due to their potential role in dementia. In the present study, \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers of curcumin glucosides (CGs) were synthesized and evaluated for Alzheimer's treatment. CGs were synthesized by fusion reaction as a novel and easy method with more advantages (high yield, short reaction time, and low chemicals), and the products were characterized using HNMR. Wistar male rats were used to administer different treatments. They divided into control, sham, Alzheimer, and test groups (Alzheimer\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b1 anomer and Alzheimer\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2 anomer). Animals received normal saline, Scopolamine (1\u00a0mg/kg), high dose anomers, scopolamine, and two doses (12.5 and 25\u00a0mg/kg) of anomers, respectively, for 10\u00a0days. Then the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was performed on all animals. Finally, the animals' brains were extracted and homogenized for glutathione, acetylcholine esterase activity, protein carbonyl, and lipid peroxide level detection. The escape latency and the distance towards the hidden platform in Morris water maze in the Alzheimer group were significantly higher than both the control and test groups. Besides, there were no significant differences between sham and control groups in all tests. Both anomers led to a significant increase in glutathione, and acetylcholine levels while they caused a decrease in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels in brain tissue. It seems that intranasal administration of both anomers positively influenced maze learning in scopolamine receiving subjects. Although both anomers resulted in similar biochemistry tests, a higher dose of \u03b2 anomer indicated better results than \u03b1 anomer not only in behavioral tests but also in biochemical tests."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
