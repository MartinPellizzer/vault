In the traditional system of medicine and modern allopathic medicine, numerous phytoconstituents have been used for the preparation of various types of formulation. Flavonoidal class phytochemicals are the main active phytoconstituents of plants, fruit, vegetables and beverages. Flavonoidal class phytochemicals are more referred as \"nutraceuticals\" due to their important pharmacological activities in the mammalian body.", "In order to understand the beneficial health effects of flavonoidal class chemical, the present work summarized the health beneficial aspects of pectolinarin. Present work summarized the medicinal importance, pharmacological activities and analytical aspects of pectolinarin with various experimental models and advance analytical methods. However, all the collected scientific information's have been analyzed in the present work for their health beneficial potential.", "From the analysis of all the collected scientific information in the present work, it was found that pectolinarin is an important phytochemical present in numerous medicinal plants but especially found in Cirsium japonicum, which is an important medicinal herb of Korea, China and Japan. Pharmacological activities data analysis signified the health beneficial potential of pectolinarin for their anti-rheumatoid arthritis, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, anti-dengue, antiviral, neuroprotective and antidepressant activity. However, the effectiveness of pectolinarin in central nervous system, bone, liver and cancerous disorders have been also reported in the literature. Analysis of present scientific information revealed the health beneficial potential of pectolinarin in modern medicine due to their numerous pharmacological activities in different parts of biological systems. Due to their biological importance in food and human health, a better understanding of their biological activities indicates their potentials as therapeutic agents.", "Scientific data of the present work signified the biological potential and therapeutic benefit of pectolinarin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Naini, Prayagraj 211007, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "101313587", "ISSNLinking": "1872-3128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "28978-02-1", "NameOfSubstance": "pectolinarin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cirsium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34313205", "10.2174/1872312814666210726112910", "DML-EPUB-116842"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
