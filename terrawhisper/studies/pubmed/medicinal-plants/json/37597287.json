This study investigated the effects of adding MnSO<sub>4</sub> (0, 200, 400, and 800\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup><sup>-1</sup>) on the formation of soil Fe/Mn oxides and Cd and As uptake in rice. The application of MnSO<sub>4</sub> reduced soil pH, increased Eh, increased the contents of Fe/Mn oxides in the soil, and decreased the total Fe and Mn<sup>2+</sup> contents in the porewater. It also led to lower contents of available Cd and As, higher levels of Cd and As bound to Fe/Mn oxides, and higher abundances of Thiobacillus and Syntrophobacter. Furthermore, Mn application increased the Fe and Mn contents in the root Fe/Mn plaque and decreased the grain Cd and As contents. Therefore, Mn application may modify the microbial community and porewater composition in soil, resulting in higher levels of Fe/Mn oxides in soil and Fe/Mn plaque at the root surface and in a lower accumulation of Cd and As in rice grains. Thus, Mn application can be a promising strategy for Cd and As stabilization in soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
