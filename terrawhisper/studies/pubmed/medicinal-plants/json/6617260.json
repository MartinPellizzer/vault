Doses were administered at 6 h intervals daily for 28 days. Blood pressure, pulse rate and ECG were monitored once every 7 days for 28 days and then again 6 days after the day that the last dose was administered. All of the animals had erratic pulse rates and abnormal ECG. Weight loss occurred in all of the animals receiving the extract two and three times a day. All of the animals tested became lethargic and weak, had soft faeces and showed signs of dehydration. Also, the skin on the hindlimbs and forelimbs became very tender and could be easily torn. These effects were more pronounced in the animals receiving the extract two and three times a day."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ruffin", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hunter", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2806RR-08049-10", "Acronym": "RR", "Agency": "NCRR NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cytobios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207227", "ISSNLinking": "0011-4529"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Mutant Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6617260"]}}]}
