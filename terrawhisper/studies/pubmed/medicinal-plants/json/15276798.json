In the present study, we investigated the effects of the nonsaponin fraction of red ginseng on learning deficits in aged rats in behavioral studies and those on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA3 subfield in young rats in electrophysiological studies. In the behavioral studies, three groups of rats [aged rats with and without oral administration of the nonsaponin fraction of red ginseng and young rats] were tested with the three types of spatial-learning task [distance movement task (DMT), random-reward place search task (RRPST), and place-learning task (PLT)] in a circular open field. The results in the DMT and RRPST indicated that motivational and motor activity was not significantly different among the three groups of rats. However, performance of the aged rats without nonsaponin was significantly impaired in the PLT when compared with the young rats. Treatment with nonsaponin significantly ameliorated deficits in place-navigation learning in the aged rats in the PLT. In the electrophysiological studies, effects of nonsaponin on the LTP in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampal slices were investigated in vitro. Pretreatment with nonsaponin significantly augmented the increase in population spike amplitudes in the CA3 subfield after LTP induction. These results suggest that the nonsaponin fraction of red ginseng contains important substances to improve learning and memory in aged rats and that this amelioration by nonsaponin might be attributed partly to augmentation of LTP in the CA3 subfield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "System Emotional Science, Faculty of Medicine, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Sugitani 2630, 930-0194, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kurimoto", "ForeName": "Hiroaki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nishijo", "ForeName": "Hisao", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Uwano", "ForeName": "Teruko", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamaguchi", "ForeName": "Hidetoshi", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Yong-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawanishi", "ForeName": "Kazuko", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ono", "ForeName": "Taketoshi", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Behav", "NlmUniqueID": "0151504", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9384"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Association Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Discrimination Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hippocampus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Long-Term Potentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reinforcement, Psychology"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15276798", "10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.04.001", "S0031938404001234"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
