Processing method is a key effecting the aroma of Poria cocos. In this study, the aroma compounds of Poria cocos products processed using sweating-low-temperature drying (SW-LD), sweating-high-temperature drying (SW-HD), steaming-low-temperature drying (ST-LD), and steaming-high-temperature drying (ST-HD) were compared by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the changes in aroma compounds of Poria cocos products during processing were analyzed. GC-MS analysis showed SW-HD product had highest content of aroma compounds. Aroma activity value (OAV) analysis indicated that 9 aroma compounds contributed to the overall aroma of Poria cocos. Among 9 compounds of Poria cocos, 1-octen-3-ol, hexanal, nonanal, octanal, trans-2-octenal, and heptanal contributed to mushroom, refreshing, sweet and fatty characters. In addition, the aroma compound changes during the processing were analyzed, revealing that steaming and sweating were the key processes affecting the aroma of Poria cocos products. The findings of this study provide valuable theoretical guidance for the development of Poria cocos processing technology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
