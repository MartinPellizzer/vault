ME was prepared by the water titration method using oleic acid as oil phase, tween 80 as a surfactant and propylene glycol as a cosurfactant. Oleic acid was selected as oil phase due to its good solubilizing capacity. ME existence region was determined using pseudo-ternary phase diagrams for preparing different formulations. Six different formulations were selected with various values of oil (25-68%), water (2-3%), and the mixture of surfactant and cosurfactant (1:1) (24-67%). The selected ME formulae were characterized for optical birefringence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), pH, % transmittance, electronic conductivity, drug content, droplet size, rheological properties and stability evaluation. In vitro release study of FPCa from ME s through the synthetic membrane and hairless rat skin were evaluated. The optimized formula ME5 consisting of 5% w/w FPCa, 60% w/w oleic acid as oil phase, 3% w/w aqueous phase, and 32% w/w of surfactant phase containing Tween 80 and propylene glycol (1:\u20091) showed the highest transdermal flux and highest skin permeation rate. Finally, the % inhibition of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema of the optimized formula ME5 was highly significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) as compared to plain gel of FPCa. In conclusion, ME is a promising technique for topical delivery of FPCa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Pharmaceutics , The Applied Research Center of Medicinal Plants \"ARCMP\", National Organization for Drug Control and Research \"NODCAR\" , El-Haram, Giza , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farghaly", "ForeName": "Dalia Ali", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy , Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University , Kasr El-Aini St, Cairo , Egypt , and."}], "LastName": "Aboelwafa", "ForeName": "Ahmed A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Pharmaceutics , National Organization for Drug Control and Research \"NODCAR\" , Agouza , Giza , Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hamza", "ForeName": "Manal Y", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmaceutics and Industrial Pharmacy , Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University , Kasr El-Aini St, Cairo , Egypt , and."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Magdy I", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Liposome Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9001952", "ISSNLinking": "0898-2104"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysorbates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2UMI9U37CP", "NameOfSubstance": "Oleic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RA33EAC7KY", "NameOfSubstance": "Fenoprofen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Liberation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fenoprofen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysorbates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28081643", "10.1080/08982104.2017.1281951"]}}]}
