(coloratum)] by affinity chromatography on a hydrolysed Sepharose 4B column, and the chemical and biological properties of KML-C were examined, partly by comparing them with a lectin (EML-1) from European mistletoe[Viscum album L. (loranthaceae)]. The hemagglutinating activity of KML-C was inhibited by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and D-galactose at the minimum concentrations of 6.3 and 12.5 microM/ml, respectively. Further biochemical analyses indicated that KML-C consists of four chains (Mr = 27.5, 30, 31 and 32.5 kDa) which, in some of the molecules, are disulfide-linked, and that the chains of KML-C are distributed over a broad range of isoelectric points (pI), 8.0 to 9.0, whereas the range for EML-1 is 6.6-7.0. A difference was also observed between the N-terminal sequences of KML-C and EML-1. The isolated lectins showed strong cytotoxicity against various human and murine tumor cells, and the cytotoxic activity of KML-C was higher than that of EML-1. Tumor cells treated with KML-C exhibited typical patterns of apoptotic cell death, such as apparent morphological changes and DNA fragmentation, and its apoptosis-inducing activity was blocked by addition of Zn2+, an inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+ -dependent endonucleases, in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that KML-C is a novel lectin related to the cytotoxicity of Korean mistletoe, and that its cytotoxic activity against tumor cells is due to apoptosis mediated by Ca2+/Mg2+ -dependent endonucleases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biomedical Research, Han Dong University, Pohang, Kyungbook, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "T J", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoo", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "T B", "Initials": "TB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shimazaki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Azuma", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10211936", "10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00300-0", "S0304-3835(98)00300-0"]}}]}
