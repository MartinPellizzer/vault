This study was designed to determine, for the first time, how geniposide from G. jasminoides regulates hepatic glucose production, and the underlying mechanisms. During in vitro study, we found the inhibitory effect of geniposide on the hepatic glucose production is partly through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in HepG2 cells. Geniposide significantly inhibited hepatic glucose production in a dose-dependent manner. AMPK, acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (ACC) and forkhead box class O1 (FoxO1) phosphorylation were stimulated by different concentrations of geniposide. In addition, the enzyme activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) were all significantly suppressed. What is important is that these effects were partly reversed by (1) inhibition of AMPK activity by compound C, a selective AMPK inhibitor, and by (2) suppression of AMPK\u03b1 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA). In summary, geniposide potentially ameliorates hyperglycemia through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis by modulation of the AMPK-FoxO1 signaling pathway. Geniposide or geniposide-containing medicinal plants could represent a promising therapeutic agent to prevent type 2 diabetes on gluconeogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Lab of Catalysis & Functional Organic Molecules, Chongqing Technology and Business University."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lixia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Xuxu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jianhui", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Zhongyi", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "FOXO1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Forkhead Box Protein O1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Small Interfering"}, {"RegistryNumber": "145295QLXY", "NameOfSubstance": "geniposide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.31", "NameOfSubstance": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "AMP-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Forkhead Box Protein O1"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iridoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Small Interfering"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26830672", "10.1248/bpb.b15-00591"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
