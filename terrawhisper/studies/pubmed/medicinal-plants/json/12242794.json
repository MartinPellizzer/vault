The Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain was EHA101, containing vector plasmid PGA482GG. The GUS gene and NPT II gene were introduced into the transformation plasmid.", "20-day epicotyls were suitable for transformation. 2-day precultivation enhanced shoot regeneration. Shoot regeneration frequency was high when the cocultivation lasted 2-3 days. With the presence of acetosyringone during cocultivation, the efficiency of transformation could be greatly enhanced, and the frequency of shoot regeneration rose as high as 27.5%. After the explants were cocultivated with Agrobacterium, 2-day delayed selection could stimulate shoot regeneration.", "An effective genetic transformation system has been established for Poncirus trifoliata on the basis of factors affecting Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou 510407."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "866P45Y84S", "NameOfSubstance": "acetosyringone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetophenones"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium tumefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Poncirus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12242794"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
