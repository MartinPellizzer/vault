Although epilepsy is common worldwide, approximately 80% of epileptic patients live in the developing countries or those with low-middle income. Up until the second decade of the 20th century, epilepsy was treated mostly by traditional remedies. Today, antiepileptic drugs are used as a general treatment instead to prevent and control epileptic seizures. However, patient access to these drugs is hindered due to the healthcare systems of their countries and a number of other reasons, such as cultural, socio-demographic, and financial poverty. In addition, approximately 30-40%of epileptic patients suffer from refractory epilepsy, additionally, AEDs have adverse side-effects that can lead to treatment failure or reduce the patient's quality of life. Despite recent advances in the treatment of epilepsy, there is still a need for improving medical treatment with a particular focus on efficacy, safety, and accessibility. Since herbal medicines have been used for many centuries around the world for treating epilepsy, it is, therefore, plausible that a rigorous study on herbal medicine and phytochemical components within plants of various species and origin may lead to the discovery of novel AEDs. Nowadays, many medicinal plants used in different cultures and regions of the world have been identified. Most phytochemical components of these plants have been identified and, in some cases, their targets located. Therefore, it is possible that new, effective, and accessible anticonvulsants drugs can be obtained from a medicinal plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aghdash", "ForeName": "Simin Namvar", "Initials": "SN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Epilepsy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "31"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33023444", "10.2174/1389450121999201001152221", "CDT-EPUB-110385"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
