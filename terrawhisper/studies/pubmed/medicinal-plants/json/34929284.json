Herein, the effects of LMWOAs (including acetic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, and citric acid) on the mobility of heavy metal ions (including Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and Co<sup>2+</sup>) in porous media were investigated to reveal the role of the stability constants of metal-LMWOA complexes in the mobility of heavy metal ions in porous media. The results showed that the mobility of different metal ions followed the order of Cd<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0<\u00a0Zn<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0<\u00a0Ni<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0<\u00a0Mn<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0<\u00a0Co<sup>2+</sup> despite of LMWOAs-free or LMWOAs-addition. For each heavy metal, all the organic acids enhanced its transport by forming stable non-adsorbing metal-LMWOA complexes and the enhanced ability followed the order of citric acid\u00a0>\u00a0oxalic acid\u00a0>\u00a0malonic acid\u00a0>\u00a0tartaric acid\u00a0>\u00a0acetic acid. An interesting finding was that there was a significantly positive correlation between the enhanced abilities of LMWOAs to metal mobility and the complex stability constants (log K) (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.801-0.961, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that the complex stability of metal-LMWOA was the dominant factor responsible for the enhanced transport of heavy metal ions. Meanwhile, the linear slope indicated the intensity of enhancement of LMWOAs on heavy metal mobility was heavy metal type-dependent. This study proposed that the complex stability of metal-LMWOA could be an indicator to quantify and predict the impact of LMWOAs on the mobility of heavy metals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
