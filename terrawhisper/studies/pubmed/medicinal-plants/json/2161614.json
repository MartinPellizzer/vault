To determine the effects of canned beans on serum lipid concentrations, 24 hyperlipidemic men ate one of three bean diets for 21 d in a metabolic ward. Diets A and B included 227 g canned beans (120 g beans with 107 g tomato sauce) daily, in a single dose for diet A and in a divided dose for diet B. Diet C included 182 g canned beans (162 g beans with 20 g tomato sauce) daily in a divided dose. All bean diets combined lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations 10.4% (p less than 0.001) and 10.8% (p less than 0.025), respectively. Diet B was as effective as diet C, and the groups on those diets had greater cholesterol reductions than did the group on diet A. Serum cholesterol reduction was positively correlated (p less than 0.01) with intake of total dietary fiber and soluble fiber. The ratios of low- to high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol remained constant for all groups. Body weight decreased 1.0-1.5 kg for all groups despite constant energy intakes. Canned beans may make an important contribution to hyperlipidemia management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Metabolic Research Group, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington."}], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "J W", "Initials": "JW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gustafson", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Spencer", "ForeName": "D B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tietyen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bryant", "ForeName": "C A", "Initials": "CA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diet therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2161614", "10.1093/ajcn/51.6.1013"]}}]}
