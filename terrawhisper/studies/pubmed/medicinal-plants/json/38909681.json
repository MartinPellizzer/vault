Various progenitor/stem cells were tested in various in-vivo, in-vitro, and clinical studies for regeneration or repairing the injured tissue in the myocardial to accelerate the healing. Fetal, adult, embryonic, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have revealed the proper potency for cardiac tissue repair. As an essential communicator among cells, exosomes with specific contacts (proteins, lncRNAs, and miRNAs) greatly promote cardiac rehabilitation. Interestingly, stem cell-derived exosomes have more efficiency than stem cell transplantation. Therefore, stem cells induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), cardiac stem cells (CDC), and skeletal myoblasts) and their-derived exosomes will probably be considered an alternative therapy for CVDs remedy. In addition, stem cell-derived exosomes have been used in the diagnosis/prognosis of heart diseases. In this review, we explained the advances of stem cells/exosome-based treatment, their beneficial effects, and underlying mechanisms, which will present new insights in the clinical field in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
