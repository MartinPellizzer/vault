They also play an essential role in normal development, metabolism, cell growth, cell division, physiology, reproduction, and homeostasis and function as biological markers for tumor subclassification and as targets for hormone therapy. NRs, including steroid hormone receptors (SHRs), have been studied as tools to examine the fundamentals of transcriptional regulation within the development of mammals and human physiology, in addition to their links to disturbances. In this regard, it is widely recognized that aberrant NR signaling is responsible for the pathological growth of hormone-dependent tumors in response to SHRs dysregulation and consequently represents a potential therapeutic candidate in a range of diseases, as in the case of prostate cancer and breast cancer. On the other hand, phytosterols are a group of plant-derived compounds that act directly as ligands for NRs and have proven their efficacy in the management of diabetes, heart diseases, and cancers. However, these plants are not suggested in cases of hormone-dependent cancer since a certain group of plants contains molecules with a chemical structure similar to that of estrogens, which are known as phytoestrogens or estrogen-like compounds, such as lignans, coumestans, and isoflavones. Therefore, it remains an open and controversial debate regarding whether consuming a phytosterol-rich diet and adopting a vegetarian lifestyle like the Mediterranean diet may increase the risk of developing steroid hormone-dependent cancers by constitutively activating SHRs and thereby leading to tumor transformation. Overall, the purpose of this review is to better understand the relevant mechanistic pathways and explore epidemiological investigations in order to establish that phytosterols may contribute to the activation of NRs as cancer drivers in hormone-dependent cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
