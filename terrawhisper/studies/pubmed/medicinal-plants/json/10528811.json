The i.g. administration of HPE, 125 or 250 mg/kg, induced a 30-40% reduction in ethanol intake in rats offered 10% (v/v) ethanol for 2 h/day. The effect of these doses was selective, since they modified neither food intake nor food-associated drinking; neither did the same doses modify the rat's gross behaviour in the open-field test. A dose of 500 mg/kg frequently induced immobility and a general suppression of ingestive behaviour. In rats offered 10% ethanol for 12 h/day, ethanol intake following treatment with 250 mg/kg HPE was significantly lower than that of controls for up to 10 h. The effect on ethanol intake was not related to the antidepressant-like effect of HPE revealed in the forced swimming test. In this regard, the effect on ethanol intake was observed after a single administration of 125 mg/kg, whereas the antidepressant effect was observed only after repeated treatment with doses higher than 125 mg/kg HPE. The i.g. administration of HPE, 250 mg/kg, did not affect blood-alcohol levels following i.g. treatment with 0.7 g/kg ethanol, the amount usually ingested in a single drinking episode; thus, the effect is not related to changes in the pharmacokinetics of ethanol. The present study shows that HPE markedly reduces ethanol intake in msP rats, without significantly modifying food intake."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Experimental Medicine, University of Camerino, Italy."}], "LastName": "Perfumi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ciccocioppo", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Angeletti", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cucculelli", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Massi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Alcohol Alcohol", "NlmUniqueID": "8310684", "ISSNLinking": "0735-0414"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Deterrents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Deterrents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Depressants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "blood"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immobilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10528811", "10.1093/alcalc/34.5.690"]}}]}
