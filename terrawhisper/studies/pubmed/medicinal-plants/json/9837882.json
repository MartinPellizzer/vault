Both enzyme activity and average product structure were determined at intervals along the deesterification pathway at pH 5.6 and 7.6. The latter analyses were performed by 13C NMR spectroscopy, and the degree of esterification was probed by both 13C NMR and potentiometric measurements. A dichotomy was observed in the behavior of the alpha and gamma isoforms when compared with that of the beta isoenzyme. Ideal blockwise deesterification mechanisms reproduced the experimental average structures (methylester distribution) throughout the course of the reaction. In the case of the alpha and gamma isoforms, a single chain mechanism associated with a free carboxyl group at the second nearest neighbor position could be postulated at pH 5.6, whereas some multiple attack character was required to reproduce the data at pH 7.6. Several mechanisms that differed from the preceding ones were compatible with the data for the beta isoform at the two pH values. Both the nature of the polysaccharides produced in these reactions and the role of pectinmethylesterase in the cell wall-stiffening process along the growth gradient are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "URA CNRS 1679, D\u00e9partement de Chimie, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, 75231 Paris Cedex 05, 38041 Grenoble C\u00e9dex, France."}], "LastName": "Catoire", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pierron", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morvan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "du Penhoat", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Goldberg", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.11", "NameOfSubstance": "pectinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Wall"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypocotyl"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9837882", "10.1074/jbc.273.50.33150", "S0021-9258(19)88514-9"]}}]}
