They effectively solubilized rock phosphate or tricalcium phosphate in Pikovskaya's liquid medium. In pot and column experiments, they significantly reduced pH and increased available phosphorus in the soil treated with either rock phosphate or superphosphate. The yield components of wheat and faba bean plants increased as a result of soil inoculation with the isolated fungi. Penicillium pinophilum was the most efficient isolate. It increased the yield of wheat grains by 28.9 and 32.8% in the soil treated with rock phosphate and superphosphate, respectively. Similarly, it increased the production of faba bean seeds by 14.7 and 29.4% with the same treatments. The uptake of phosphorus by both crops significantly increased due to inoculation of the soil with the tested fungi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Science, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahid", "ForeName": "O A", "Initials": "OA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mehana", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9437794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-5013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus fumigatus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus niger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Penicillium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11061191", "10.1016/s0944-5013(00)80036-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
