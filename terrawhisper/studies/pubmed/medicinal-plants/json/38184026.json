Despite increasing urbanization in the area, they have managed to preserve their distinctive lifestyle and extensive knowledge of traditional medicinal plants, setting them apart from other regions. However, there is a lack of systematic documentation on the knowledge of traditional medicinal plants used by the Yi people in Xiaoliangshan.", "This research aims to achieve the following objectives: 1. Document the diversity of medicinal plants used by the Yi people and explore their therapeutic usages. 2. Evaluate and analyze the main types of diseases with a high incidence in the local area and identify the types of medicinal plants used to treat these diseases. 3. Explore the underlying geographical and human factors influencing both disease prevalence and medicinal plant usage.", "Ethnobotanical research methods were used to record and analyze the medicinal plants used by the Yi in Xiaoliangshan. Experts identified all plant specimens collected during ethnobotanical field surveys. The types of diseases treated by medicinal plants were classified according to the International Classification of Primary Care -<sup>2nd</sup>.", "A total of 125 medicinal plants were recorded after interviewing 193 participants. Of the medicinal plants identified, those with over 100 use reports were Paris polyphylla (202 use reports), Taxillus sutchuenensis (183), Artemisia indica (149), and Papaver somniferum (113). A total of 14 disease categories were recorded, with those related to the following categories having higher Informant Consensus factor values (ICF \u22650.85): Pregnancy, Childbearing, Family Planning, General and Unspecified, Urological, Respiratory, Musculoskeletal, and Skin. The highest quantity of medicinal plants is utilized to improve specific diseases and health problems, namely those related to Digestion, Skin, and Musculoskeletal. Fewer plant species were utilized for diseases or health issues associated with Eyes, Psychological, or Pregnancy, Childbearing, and Family Planning. The use reports from the informants also revealed how some medicinal plants are used to treat a variety of diseases or health issues. For instance, Malva pusilla is used for inducing abortion, treating postpartum hemorrhage, and joint sprains; Artemisia indica is used for treating malaria; Argentina lineata is used to remedy tuberculosis and malaria. Taxillus sutchuenensis is used for dealing with cold, pneumonia, and other ailments.", "The Yi people in Xiaoliangshan have a rich knowledge of traditional medicinal plants. Decoction and wine brewing are the most common processing methods used for these plants, which are utilized to treat a wide range of diseases. The characteristics of the medicinal use of the Yi people reflects the alpine mountainous environment in which they live, and their medical practices are closely related to traditional healing culture. This study enhances our understanding of the Yi traditional medicine via documentation and offers a valuable reference for future research and the development of new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
