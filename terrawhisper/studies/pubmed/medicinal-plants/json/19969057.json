Most of the plants cited were exotic (51) but the difference in diversity among these plants and native plants (48) was not considered significant (p>0.05). The exotic plants were predominantly herbaceous and used to cure diseases that native plants did not seem to treat. There were no differences between men's and women's knowledge of the plants (p>0.05). However, for some communities, factors such as age and income were correlated with the number of citations and indications for plants, which suggested that older people and those with higher income levels had more knowledge about these properties.", "The data presented in this study showed the importance of exotic species in the region studied and demonstrated that plant knowledge can be perceived as a way to diversify options for medical treatment in the area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
