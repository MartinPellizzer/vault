Apart from two officially recorded species, viz. Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis (Franch.) Hand. - Mazz. (PPY) and P. polyphylla Smith var. chinensis (Franch.) Hara (PPC), there are still many other species used as folk medicine. It is necessary to understand the metabolic differences among Paris species.", "To establish a strategy that can discover species-specific steroidal saponin markers to distinguish closely-related Paris herbs for quality and safety control.", "A new strategy of molecular-networking-guided discovery of species-specific markers was proposed. Firstly, the ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) was applied to obtain the MS and MS/MS data of all samples. Then, molecular networking (MN) was created using MS/MS data to prescreen the steroidal saponins for subsequent analysis. Next, the principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) models were established to discover potential markers. Finally, the verification, identification and distribution of chemical markers were performed.", "A total of 126 steroidal saponins were screened out from five species using MN. Five species were classified successfully by OPLS-DA model, and 18 species-specific markers were discovered combining the variable importance in the projection (VIP) value, P value (one-way ANOVA) and their relative abundance. These markers could predict the species of Paris herbs correctly.", "These results revealed that this new strategy could be an efficient way for chemical discrimination of medicinal herbs with close genetic relationship."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
