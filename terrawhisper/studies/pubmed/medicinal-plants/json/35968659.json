A new \u03b4-lactone derivative, syzysamalactone (<b>1</b>), along with a known biogenetically related \u03b4-lactone derivative, 6-pentyl-\u03b1-pyrone (<b>2</b>), were isolated from the fresh ripe fruits of <i>S. samarangense</i>. Syzysamalactone (<b>1</b>) is an unusual 11-carbon \u03b4-lactone derivative, and its chemical structure and absolute configuration were elucidated by spectroscopic data analysis. A plausible biogenetic pathway for <b>1</b> was also proposed. Furthermore, the potential neuroprotective effects of compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> were assessed. As a result, compounds <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> displayed notable neuroprotective effects with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.29 \u00b1 0.03 and 1.28 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcM, respectively, using the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. This is the first report of \u03b4-lactone derivatives showing significant neuroprotective activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key
