In the 1950s, studies with licorice-derived compounds revealed that the anti-ulcer effects of licorice are due to inhibition of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and delta 13-prostaglandin reductase. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase converts prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha to 15-ketoprostaglandins, which are inactive. delta 13-Prostaglandin reductase metabolizes the inactive delta 13-prostaglandin to 13,14-dihydro,15-ketoprostaglandin, which is further metabolized and excreted in urine. Thus, licorice-derived compounds have the effect of raising the local concentration of prostaglandins that promote mucous secretion and cell proliferation in the stomach, leading to healing of ulcers. 11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which also is inhibited by licorice-derived compounds, shares a common ancestor with 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. Both enzymes are homologous to Streptomyces hydrogenans 3 alpha,20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which also is inhibited by licorice. Thus, licorice inhibits enzymes that diverged at least 2 billion years ago from a common ancestor. Other oxidoreductases in bacteria, plants, and animals that are inhibited by licorice-derived compounds are likely to be discovered in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0623."}], "LastName": "Baker", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Steroids", "NlmUniqueID": "0404536", "ISSNLinking": "0039-128X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.141", "NameOfSubstance": "15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.146", "NameOfSubstance": "11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.53", "NameOfSubstance": "Cortisone Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Evolution"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Cortisone Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Streptococcus"}], "NumberOfReferences": "46"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8191543", "10.1016/0039-128x(94)90091-4", "0039-128X(94)90091-4"]}}]}
