Leads were identified via rigorous scoring thresholds and ADMET filtering. MM-GBSA calculation was deployed to select NSP9-Lead complexes and the complexes were evaluated for their stability and protein-ligand communication via MD simulation. We identified 5 phytochemical leads for NSP9, 23 for Furin, 18 for ORF3a, and 19 for IL-6. Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B, obtained from <i>Lonicera japonica</i> (Japanese Honeysuckle) and <i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> (Licorice), respectively, were identified to have the highest potential polypharmacological properties for the aforementioned targets and may act on multiple pathways simultaneously to inhibit viral entry, replication, and disease progression. Additionally, MD simulation supports the robust stability of Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B against NSP9 at the active sites via hydrophobic interactions, H-bonding, and H-bonding facilitated by water. This study promotes the initiation of further experimental analysis of natural product-based anti-COVID-19 therapeutics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9408-9816"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemical Sciences, National Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhubaneswar, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), BARC Training School Complex, Mumbai, India."}], "LastName": "Bandyopadhyay", "ForeName": "Suritra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Abiodun", "ForeName": "Omobolanle Abimbola", "Initials": "OA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pure and Industrial Chemistry, Faculty of Physical Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka."}], "LastName": "Ogboo", "ForeName": "Blessing Chinweotito", "Initials": "BC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Alfaisal University Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Kola-Mustapha", "ForeName": "Adeola Tawakalitu", "Initials": "AT"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1422-0621"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nigeria, Nsukka."}], "LastName": "Attah", "ForeName": "Emmanuel Ifeanyi", "Initials": "EI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6034-3780"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Sciences, Samuel Adegboyega University, Ogwa, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Edemhanria", "ForeName": "Lawrence", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bionivid Technology Pvt.
