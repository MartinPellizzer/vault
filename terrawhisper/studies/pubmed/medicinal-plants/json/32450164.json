This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of NAC by niosomal carriers.", "Niosomes were synthesized using surface active agents film hydration method and their physicochemical properties were characterized. In the in vivo study, in addition to control group, male rats were divided in different groups and challenged with an oral dose of APAP (2000\u00a0mg/kg); 4\u00a0h later, rats were administered normal saline, empty niosome (NIO), NAC (25\u00a0mg/kg) and NAC-loaded niosome (NAC-NIO) respectively, and sacrificed 48\u00a0h post-APAP overdose.", "The particle size and zeta potential of NAC-NIO were 242.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.5\u00a0nm and -23.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0mV. The loading and encapsulation efficiency of niosomes were 1.22%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02% and 26.76%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.02%. APAP administration leads to hepatic damage as evidenced by increases in serum hepatic enzyme levels and tissue levels of nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation as well as decreases in hepatic levels of reduced glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment of rats with NIO-NAC was remarkably more effective than NAC in improving biochemical changes such as serum hepatic aminotransferases. These findings were correlated well to the histopathological experiments.", "Our results suggest that NAC when delivered as a niosomal structure, is potentially more effective than NAC standard, in improving APAP-induced hepatotoxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
