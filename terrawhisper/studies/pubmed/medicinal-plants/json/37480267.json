As a result, there is an urgent need for new strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One of these essential strategies is the combination of medicinal plants and antibiotics as an alternative to using antibiotics alone which was the objective of this article. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Nine plant materials were collected from different Egypt localities and then extracted by water. Water extracts were filtered and added with Mueller-Hinton agar during preparation. Nine test bacteria and 13 standard antibiotics were used in the disc diffusion sensitivity method. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The activity of Amikacin was increased when combined with most different plant extracts against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; while antagonistic against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. Aztreonam, Ceftriaxone, Gentamicin and Nalidixic acid antibiotics showed antagonistic or indifferent effects when combined with most different plant extracts against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumonia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. The synergistic effect was achieved in Aztreonam when combined with all plant extracts, while Nalidixic acid showed antagonistic when combined with most plant extracts against &lt;i&gt;Proteus mirabilis&lt;/i&gt;. The antagonistic effect was achieved in Aztreonam, Ceftriaxone and Nalidixic acid when combined with &lt;i&gt;Achillea fragrantissima&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Artemisia monosperma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leptadenia pyrotechnica&lt;/i&gt;, also Aztreonam with &lt;i&gt;Lycium shawii&lt;/i&gt; extract against &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;A. fragrantissima&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. monosperma&lt;/i&gt; increase the activity of Novobiocin and Vancomycin against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; and Ampicillin and Cefazolin against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; but Novobiocin activity increased with most plant extracts against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The combinations of antibiotics with the extracts of medicinal plants displayed varying degrees of effects, synergistic, antagonistic and indifferent according to antibiotic type, plant extract and test organism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Sakhawy", "ForeName": "Mohamed Abdel-Monem", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G2B4VE5GH8", "NameOfSubstance": "Aztreonam"}, {"RegistryNumber": "75J73V1629", "NameOfSubstance": "Ceftriaxone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3B91HWA56M", "NameOfSubstance": "Nalidixic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "17EC19951N", "NameOfSubstance": "Novobiocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aztreonam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ceftriaxone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nalidixic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Novobiocin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus cereus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "42"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37480267", "10.3923/pjbs.2023.108.118"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
