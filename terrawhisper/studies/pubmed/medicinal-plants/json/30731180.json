One of the reasons for using contraception among indigenous communities is for child spacing.", "The study aims to review medicinal plants used for contraception in South Africa as potential sources for the discovery and development of safe male and female hormonal contraceptives.", "A literature search was conducted on medicinal plants used for contraception in South Africa by referencing textbooks and scientific databases such as Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, North-West University Institutional Repository, National ETD Portal, government policies and documents on contraception, theses and dissertations, and other web sources such as records from SANBI and PROTA.", "A minimum of 25 medicinal plants were identified as being used for contraception in South Africa, and these plants included local and exotic plants. Medicinal plants with contraceptive activity are Bulbine latifolia, Pouzolzia mixta, Salsola tuberculatiformis, Securidaca longipedunculata, and Typha capensis. In vivo and in vitro studies showed a decrease in mount, intromission and ejaculatory frequencies, inhibition of implantation, contraceptive effect, displaced glucocorticoids, and prolonged diestrus or had negative effects on vitality, motility, and sperm production.", "Some of the plants used for contraception in South Africa are toxic to both animals and humans. Research is needed focusing on medicinal plants used by men for contraception and by women for postcoital contraception in South Africa. Traditional healers must be included when drafting contraception policies and interventions. Medicinal plants such as B. latifolia and P. mixta demonstrated that medicinal plants used for contraception in South Africa are potential sources for the discovery and development of safe male and female hormonal contraceptives."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
