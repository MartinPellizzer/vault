Since the standard of care for treatment, which includes surgery and chemoradiation, has not provided a sustainable and durable response in affected patients, seeking novel therapeutic approaches to treat GBM seems imperative. Immunotherapy, a breakthrough for cancer treatment, has become an attractive tool for combating cancer with the potential to access the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). In this regard, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), as major immunological checkpoints, have drawn considerable interest due to their effectiveness in a spectrum of highly-aggressive neoplasms through negative regulation of the T-cell-mediated immune response. Nevertheless, due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM, the efficacy of these immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), when used as monotherapy, has been unfavorable and lacks sufficient beneficial outcomes for GBM patients. A variety of clinical studies are attempting to evaluate the combination of ICIs (neoadjuvant/adjuvant) and existing treatment guidelines to strengthen their effectiveness; however, the exact mechanism of this signaling axis affects the consequences of immune therapy remains elusive. This review provides an overview of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, currently approved ICIs for clinical use, preclinical and clinical trials of PD-1/PD-L1 as monotherapy, and when used concomitantly with other GBM treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
