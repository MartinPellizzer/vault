This research was carried out to evaluate the proliferative-inhibitory effect of CF extracts against cancer cells and to identify the new pro-substance from medicinal plants. Among these herbal extracts extracted from KCF (Korean Corni Fructus), JCF (Japanese Corni Fructus) and CCF (Chinese Corni Fructus), KCF extracts strongly induced anti-proliferation of cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner compared with other extracts. Moreover, after treatment with CM/F3 (fraction 3 obtained from KCF extracts) for 24 h, A549 cells were evaluated by several indicators such as cell viability, LDH release, DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, and apoptotic proteins in vitro. CM/F3 showed the tumor-selective growth inhibitory activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner in A549 cells. Consistently, CM/F3 effectively induced the activation of bax, cytochrome-c, caspase-3, -8, -9, p53, and p21 causing apoptosis, and caused the suppression of Cdk2, pRb, and E2F1 related to cell arrest in A549 cells. These results demonstrate that CM/F3 caused not only anti-proliferation but also cell death involving cell arrest through interaction between apoptotic proteins and the upregulation of p53 in A549 cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Zoology, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea. whchoi@khu.ac.kr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Won-Hyung", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Jong-Phil", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Mei-Hua", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baek", "ForeName": "Seung-Hwa", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Hyun-do", "Initials": "HD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CDKN1A protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cornus"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "G1 Phase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "5", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21132604", "10.1080/01635581.2010.516475", "930698852"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
