In February 2023, anthracnose symptoms were observed on <i>C. indicum</i> leaves in Nanning Garden Expo (N22\u00b043', E108\u00b028'), Guangxi, China, causing severe defoliation of infected plants with a foliar disease incidence ranging from 40 to 60% (n = 100) in a 2 ha field. Disease symptoms began with small red spots (2 to 3 mm by 2 to 3 mm) on the leaves and gradually enlarged to larger irregular light grey lesions with yellowish halos (3 to 5 mm by 2 to 8 mm). In the late stage, spots merged into larger irregular lesions (5 to 15 mm by 6 to 13 mm) and the necrotic lesions abscised. Three diseased samples in total were collected from plants in three different locations. Symptomatic leaves were cut into small pieces (3\u00d73 mm), disinfected with 75% ethanol solution for 10 s, 2% NaClO for 1 min followed by three washes in sterile distilled water. Tissue pieces were separately plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for five days. One representative isolate from each sample (SJ-1, SJ2-1 and SJ3-1) were chosen for further analysis. Colonies were villiform, initially white, later turning gray in 7 days on PDA at 25\u2103. The average diameter for colonies were 8.1 cm, 8.0 cm and 8.1 cm for SJ1-1, SJ2-1 and SJ3-1, respectively. Conidia were aseptate, hyaline, cylindroid, and averaged 11.94 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.04 \u03bcm, 11.78 \u03bcm \u00d7 5.14 \u03bcm and 11.74 \u03bcm \u00d7 4.59 \u03bcm (n=90) for SJ1-1, SJ2-1 and SJ3-1, respectively. The characteristics were close to the descriptions of <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. (Weir et al. 2012). Genomic DNA was extracted from 7-day-old aerial mycelia of these isolates. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<i>GAPDH</i>), actin (<i>ACT</i>), \u03b2-tubulin (<i>TUB2</i>), chitin synthase (<i>CHS-1</i>), calmodulin (<i>CAL</i>) and the intergenic region between apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMat) were amplified using primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), GDF/GDR, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, T1/Bt2b, CHS-79F/CHS-354R, CL1C/CL2C (Weir et al. 2012) and AM-F/AM-R (Silva et al. 2012), respectively. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS: OR540240-OR540242; <i>GAPDH</i>: PP328968-PP328970; <i>ACT</i>: PP328959-PP328961; <i>TUB2</i>: PP328971-PP328973; <i>CHS-1</i>: PP328965-PP328967; <i>CAL</i>: PP328962-PP328964 and ApMat: OR548253-OR548255). A phylogenetic analysis was made via Bayesian inference based on the concatenated sequences (ITS, <i>GAPDH</i>, <i>ACT</i>, <i>TUB2</i>, <i>CHS-1</i>, <i>CAL</i> and ApMat). According to morphology and phylogenetic analysis, SJ1-1, SJ2-1 and SJ3-1 were identified as <i>C. aeschynomenes</i>. Pathogenicity was confirmed on leaves with and without wounds of 24 one-year-old <i>C. indicum</i> plants in a greenhouse in Nanning, Guangxi Province. The wound was made with a sterilized needle. Wounded and unwounded leaves were inoculated with 20 \u03bcl of conidial suspension (10<sup>6</sup> spores/ml in 0.1% sterile Tween 20) of the three isolates and control plants were inoculated with water containing 0.1% sterile Tween 20 (6 leaves/plant, 3 plants/treatment). All plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain a high humidity environment and placed in a 28\u00b0C growth chamber with constant light. After 7 days of incubation, necrotic lesions were observed on inoculated wounded leaves, whereas unwounded leaves and control plants showed no symptoms. The fungi were re-isolated from symptomatic leaves, completing Koch's postulates. These species can cause severe diseases in a variety of plants worldwide, such as <i>Manihot esculenta</i>, <i>Theobroma cacao</i> and <i>Myrciaria dubia</i> (Sangpueak et al. 2018; Nascimento et al. 2019; Matos et al. 2020). To our knowledge, this is the first report of <i>C. aeschynomenes</i> causing <i>C. indicum</i> leaf anthracnose in China. The results will provide valuable information for management of anthracnose in <i>C. indicum</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze University, College of life Sciences, Jingzhou, Hubei , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 694007492@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 2782796206@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Ouyang", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yangtze University, College of life Sciences, Jingzhou, Hubei , China; 75102310@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wenxiu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 654123597@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Lihua", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 361566787@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "SuiPing", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; 56297244@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiaolin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, Nanning, Guangxi, China; guotangxun@gxaas.net."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Tangxun", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Institute of Plant Protection, 174 daxue road, Nanning, Guangxi Province, Nanning, Guangxi, China, 530007; 65615384@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Qili", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39082929", "10.1094/PDIS-02-24-0446-PDN"]}}]}
