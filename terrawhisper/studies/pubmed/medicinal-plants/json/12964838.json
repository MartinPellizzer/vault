Insufficient knowledge about the molecular mechanism of these medicinal plants limits the scope of their application and hinders the effort to design new drugs using the therapeutic principles of herbal medicines. This problem can be partially alleviated if efficient methods for rapid identification of protein targets of herbal ingredients can be introduced. Efforts have been directed at developing efficient computer methods for facilitating target identification. Various methods being explored or under investigation are reviewed here. So far, one computer method, INVDOCK, has been specifically used for automated drug target identification. Its usefulness in the identification of therapeutic targets of medicinal herbal ingredients as well as synthetic chemicals is reviewed. The majority of INVDOCK identified therapeutic targets of several well-known medicinal herbal ingredients have been found to be confirmed or implicated by experiments, which suggests the potential of in silico methods in facilitating the study of molecular mechanism of medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Computational Science, National University of Singapore, Blk S17, Level 7, 3 Science Drive 2, Singapore 117543."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ung", "ForeName": "Choong Yong", "Initials": "CY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yuzong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "8502408", "ISSNLinking": "0265-0568"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12964838", "10.1039/b303745b"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
