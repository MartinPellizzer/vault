Amastigote form of <i>L. major</i> was inoculated to the tail base of thirty mice. After their tails became wounded, mice were divided into six groups. The first group was used as control and the second group received 100 mg/kg of Echinacea extract (orally). The third group was treated by meglumine antimoniate with dose of 20 mg/kg. Combination therapy was used for group four, five, and six where the mice received a different concentration of extract (100-200 mg/kg) and glucantime (10-20 mg/kg). The size of the cutaneous lesion on tail base was measured regularly. Findings were analyzed by SPSS software and using Kruskal-Wallis test.", "The sizes of the lesion were increased in all mice of control group by the time. The mean size of lesions in mice receiving the extract and/or receiving the extract along with meglumine antimoniate was lower than those of control mice, but the differences were not statistically significant (<i>P</i> > 0.05). On the other hand, the differences between the group of mice which received meglumine antimoniate alone, and the rest of groups were statistically significant (<i>P</i> < 0.05).", "<i>E. purpurea</i> extract in doses which have been used in this study and combination with meglumine antimoniate was not much effective against <i>L. major</i> in BALB/C mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Basic Sciences in Infectious Diseases Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sarkari", "ForeName": "Bahador", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohseni", "ForeName": "Mobin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants Processing Research Center, Faculty of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moein", "ForeName": "Mahmoud Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahriarirad", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asgari", "ForeName": "Qasem", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Int J Appl Basic Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101579831", "ISSNLinking": "2229-516X"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Murray HW, Berman JD, Davies CR, Saravia NG.
