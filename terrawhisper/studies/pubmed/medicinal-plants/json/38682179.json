However, the development of GC resistance limits their prolonged use.", "In this study, we investigated the potential of a newly synthesized indole derivative called LWX-473, in combination with the classic GC Dexamethasone (DEX), to enhance the responsiveness of Jurkat cells to GC treatment.", "Our findings demonstrate that LWX-473 alone or in combination with DEX significantly improves GC-induced cell apoptosis and arrests the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Notably, the combination of LWX-473 and DEX exhibits superior efficacy in killing Jurkat cells compared to LWX-473 alone. Importantly, this compound demonstrates reduced toxicity towards normal cells.", "Our study reveals that LWX-473 has the ability to restore the sensitivity of Jurkat cells to DEX by modulating the mitochondrial membrane potential, activating the expression of DEX-liganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and inhibiting key molecules in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. These findings suggest that LWX-473 could be a potential therapeutic agent for overcoming GC resistance in lymphoid malignancies."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
