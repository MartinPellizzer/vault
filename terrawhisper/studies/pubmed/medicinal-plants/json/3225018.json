In 4 groups of rats the left uterine horn was ligated 2 days after coitus. Rats in group A were used as controls. In group B 25 mcl neem oil was administered intravaginally on days 2-4 with the animals in head down position for 3 minutes to ensure that the neem oil was uniformly distributed in the vagina. In group C the neem oil was administered on days 4-6, and in group D on days 7-9, i.e., after implantation. The ligatures were removed on day 12, and no viable implantation sites were found in either horn. The study showed that the neem oil exerts its effect on the endometrium through absorption into the general circulation from the vaginal epithelium. The antiestrogenic quality of neem oil explains its anti-implantation effect. But the postimplantation effect, which caused implanted fetuses to be either resorbed or expelled, may be due to direct toxicity, to a fall in progesterone level, or to interference with the uterine utilization of progesterone."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["057104", "00186640"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents--pharmacodynamics", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Animals, Laboratory", "Biology", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Endocrine System", "Endometrium", "Estrogens", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Genitalia", "Genitalia, Female", "Health", "Health Services", "Hormone Antagonists--pharmacodynamics", "Hormones", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Progestational Hormones", "Progesterone", "Research Methodology", "Urogenital System", "Uterus"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "3225018", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "03", "Day": "29"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0971-5916", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "88", "PubDate": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "The Indian journal of medical research", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Med Res"}, "ArticleTitle": "Mechanism of antifertility action of neem oil.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "339", "EndPage": "342", "MedlinePgn": "339-42"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Riar", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bardhan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kain", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parshad", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4DKJ9B3K2T", "NameOfSubstance": "neem oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Implantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycerides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3225018"]}}]}
