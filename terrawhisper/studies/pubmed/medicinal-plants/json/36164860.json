Animal medicine isscarcer than herbal medicine. In recent years, with the vigorous development of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM),the contradiction between the increasing industrial demand andsupply of scarce and even endangered medicinal animals has become increasingly prominent. The continuous lack of medicinal animal resources affects the clinical demandandalso causes serious damage to the ecological environment. Only relying on artificial breeding is not enough to alleviate the current condition of depletion. In the face of this dilemma, it is a major challenge for the current industrial development to protect animal resources and meet clinical and industrial needs with &quot;available medicines&quot;. The application of substitutes for animal medicines isthe key focus to alleviate this problem, and it is also the key scientific issue to be solved urgently in the modernization of TCM. This paper summarizedand reviewedthe history, current situation, strategies, and methods of animal medicinesubstitution and put forward the point of view of &quot;similar chemical characteristics, similar efficacy, and higher safety&quot; to provide references for scientific substitution and resource protection of rare animals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wei-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Li-Li", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jiao-Jiao", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Yu-Yu", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Jin-Ao", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of High-Tech Research for Formulations,Jiangsu Provincial Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicine Resources Industrialization Process Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Hong-Yue", "Initials": "HY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "27", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "22"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36164860", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220601.601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
