Plant extracts were prepared and screened for in vitro anticancer activity against a panel of three human cell lines (breast MCF7, renal TK10 and melanoma UACC62) at the CSIR. Plant extracts that exhibited anticancer activity against these three human cell lines were screened by the NCI against sixty human cancer cell lines organized into sub-panels representing leukaemia, melanoma, cancer of the lung, colon, kidney, ovary, central nervous system, breast and prostate.", "A total of 7500 plant extracts were screened for in vitro anticancer activity against breast MCF7, renal TK10 and melanoma UACC62 human cell lines between the period 1999 and 2006. Hits were classified into four categories based on their total growth inhibition of the cell lines. A hit rate of 5.9% was obtained for extracts which showed moderate activity and these were screened by the NCI against a panel of sixty human cancer cell lines. The extracts of plant species with limited published information for their anticancer properties were subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and the active constituents isolated and identified. The largest number of plant specimens in this study was from the family Asteraceae, which is rich in sesquiterpene lactones.", "Although the extracts of the plants were randomly selected, 68% of these plant species which were hits in the screening programme are reported to be used medicinally. Based on our data, it appears that unrelated medicinal use of the source plants may serve as an initial guide to selection of plants for anticancer screening."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biosciences, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, PO Box 395, Pretoria, Gauteng 0001, South Africa. gfouche@csir.co.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fouche", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cragg", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pillay", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kolesnikova", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Maharaj", "ForeName": "V J", "Initials": "VJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Senabe", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18678239", "10.1016/j.jep.2008.07.005", "S0378-8741(08)00359-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
