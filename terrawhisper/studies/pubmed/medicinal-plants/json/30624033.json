Because of their intrinsic potential for use in both biomedical and agricultural applications, there is a general need for new compounds and for the synthesis of 'natural-inspired' analogues. Importantly, transition of a natural product from discovery to a 'market lead' is associated with an increasingly challenging demand for more of the compound, which cannot be met by isolation from natural plant sources, often due to low extraction yields and uneven availability of the plant source itself. Synthesis remains the most reliable approach to provide valuable products for the market. In this review, a comprehensive overview of our contribution to synthetic access to N-derived natural products is given. Major strengths of the proposed methodologies are discussed critically. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9510-8783"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."}], "LastName": "Prandi", "ForeName": "Cristina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry 'U.
