The essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from the dried leaves of <i>P. stenoptera</i> was analysed by GC-MS and 39 constituents accounting for the total 90.44% of the oil were identified. The main constituents were \u03b4-cadinene (24.83%), caryophyllene oxide (9.10%), \u03b1-cadinol (7.48%) and \u03b2-elemene (6.24%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was evaluated by disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The essential oil was found to show broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities against all the tested microorganisms. <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> was the most sensitive strain with the minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.23\u2009mg/mL. The results suggested that the essential oil was a potential source of natural antimicrobials in food preservation and pharmaceutical industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui Agricultural University , Hefei , PR China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Caiping", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Life Science, Zhejiang Normal University , Jinhua , PR China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Feifei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Life Science, Zhejiang Normal University , Jinhua , PR China."}], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Anhui Agricultural University , Hefei , PR China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Life Science, Zhejiang Normal University , Jinhua , PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yinglao", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Juglandaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30919666", "10.1080/14786419.2019.1587426"]}}]}
