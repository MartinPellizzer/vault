Two peptide fragments derived from the reactive site-modified ASI-II were obtained. The analyses of the amino acid composition and sequence of these two fragments revealed that one corresponded to the region from the amino-terminal Lys to the reactive site P1 Ala and the other, to the region from the reactive site P1' Asp to the carboxyl-terminal Gly of the inhibitor. Although neither fragment alone showed inhibitory activity against subtilisin, an equimolar mixture of both fragments was found to inhibit strongly the target enzyme, as did the intact inhibitor. Thus, it was suggested that the two fragments have strong specific affinity with each other, regenerating the reactive site-modified ASI-II, to inhibit the target enzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kobe University, Hyogo."}], "LastName": "Nozawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamagata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aizono", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iwasaki", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Subtilisins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Subtilisins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1618735", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123779"]}}]}
