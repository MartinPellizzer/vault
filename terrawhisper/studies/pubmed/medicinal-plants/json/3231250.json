The effect of germination on the protein fractions, protein solubility index, PAGE pattern and some functional properties i.e. emulsification capacity (EC), foaming capacity (FC), foam stability (FS), water and fat absorption capacities of the flour was studied. Germination decreased albumins, globulins and prolamins at different levels but non protein nitrogen and glutelins were increased. The protein solubility index was high at both extreme pH values with an isoelectric point (IP) at pH of 4.4-4.5. The solubility of the protein slightly increased due to germination at all the pH values. PAGE pattern revealed on obvious dissociation and utilization for both fast and slow moving protein fractions during germination. Emulsification and foaming properties vs pH profile were similar to the pattern of solubility vs pH. Both properties were high at acidic and alkaline pH's and the minimum values were at pH 4 to 5. Germination process improved EC, FC and FS of the flour in comparison with that of dry bean flour. Water absorption of faba bean flours was improved during germination but the fat absorption markedly decreased."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Science and Technology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Minufiya, Shibin El-Kom, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Rahma", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3231250", "10.1002/food.19880320618"]}}]}
