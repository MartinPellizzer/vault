The research has shown the plant based compound is low cytotoxic, having antimicrobial, anti-cancer, antiviral and anti-parasitic effects. Andrographolide both prevent spread as well as transmission of virus to neighboring cells by interfering with different cell signaling pathways. In addition to its medicinal value, plant has been found having nutritional value. Therefore being cost effective, easy availability and having nutritional value as a natural supplement, can be used to improve the quality of life in countries having low standard of living. Due to the limited number of effective vaccines, the plant-based antiviral drugs have provided considerable hope for fighting against the viral infections. The plant-derived compound when produced in large quantities is cost effective with low cytotoxic effects. However, much deep insight research at the molecular level is needed to develop the molecules against the viral infection. This paper aims to highlight the antiviral role of Andrographolide that can made significant contributions toward the improvement of human health and will also summarize the current status and future strategies concerning the therapeutic applications of Andrographolide to combat different viral disease in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 China Pharmaceutical University.
