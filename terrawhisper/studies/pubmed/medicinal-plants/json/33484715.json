First line drugs used in the treatment of leishmaniosis are high costly, and are very aggressive requiring medical monitoring. Thus new therapeutic alternatives are needed and, in this context, natural products have been considered as a source of new antileishmania agents. Riparins are alkamides found in the unripe fruits of Aniba riparia. Several biological activities are described for this group of compounds, such as antimicrobial and antiparasitic potential. The objective of this work was to evaluate the anti-leishmania activity riparin E (Rip-E) in vitro, against promastigotes and internalized amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis. Rip-E was able to inhibit promastigote cell growth (IC<sub>50</sub> 4.7\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and to reduce the percentage of macrophages infected with amastigotes, reducing its infectivity (survival index) (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). The cytotoxicity against BALB/c murine macrophages was also assessed (CC<sub>50</sub> 50.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and the selectivity index was 38.9. Rip-E also demonstrated immunomodulatory activity, evidenced by the increase of the phagocytic capacity and lysosomal activity. However, Rip-E did not affect directly the production of nitric oxide. These results suggest that Rip-E has antileishmania potential, by both its direct inhibitory effect and its ability to activate macrophages."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
