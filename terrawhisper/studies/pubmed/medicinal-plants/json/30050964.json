It facilitates dental plaque formation. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of <i>Aloe vera</i>-Peppermint (Veramin) moisturizing gel on mouth dryness and oral health among patients hospitalized in ICUs.", "This triple-blind two-group randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken in 2016-2017 on a convenient sample of 80 patients. Patients were randomly allocated to an intervention and a placebo group. Oral care for patients in the intervention and the placebo groups was provided for 5 successive days using Veramin moisturizing gel and a placebo gel, respectively. Data were collected at the 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 5<sup>th</sup> days of the study using a demographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire, the Challacombe scale (for mouth dryness assessment), and the Mucosal-Plaque Index (for oral health assessment). The Chi-square, Fisher Exact, Mann-Whitney U, and Friedman tests were used for data analysis.", "In the 5<sup>th</sup> day, the mean score of mouth dryness in the intervention group was significantly lower than the placebo group (<i>P</i> = 0.0001). On the other hand, in the third and the 5<sup>th</sup> days, the oral health mean score in the intervention group was significantly lower than the placebo group (<i>P</i> = 0.0001).", "Veramin moisturizing gel is effective in significantly relieving mouth dryness, preventing dental plaque formation, and improving oral health. Thus, it can be used for improving oral care outcomes in ICUs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students' Research Committee, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Atashi", "ForeName": "Vajihe", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Nursing, Nursing and Midwifery School, Nursing and Midwifery Care Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yazdannik", "ForeName": "Ahmadreza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Critical Care Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahjobipoor", "ForeName": "Hosein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nursing and Midwifery Care Research Center, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghafari", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Barij Medicinal Plants Research Center, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bekhradi", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ulcer Repair Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Science, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Hojatollah", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Res Pharm Pract", "NlmUniqueID": "101614023", "ISSNLinking": "2279-042X"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Puntillo K, Arai SR, Cooper BA, Stotts NA, Nelson JE.
