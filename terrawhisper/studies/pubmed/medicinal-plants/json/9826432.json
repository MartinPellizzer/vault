Sequenced tryptic peptides also showed 78% identity (92% similarity) to the red bean acid phosphatase. Peptides exclusive for the 50-kDa subunit are homologous to N-terminally located sequences in red bean acid phosphatase, leading to the assumption that the shorter subunit of lupin acid phosphatase is generated by the deletion of the N-terminal part of the longer subunit. Carbohydrate moiety was found to be identical in both subunits. Oligosaccharide chains released by hydrazinolysis from the both subunits were fluorescently labeled and separated by HPLC. The structure of oligosaccharides was elucidated by exoglycosidase sequencing. Seventeen percent of isolated glycans were found to be of the high-mannose type, while the rest belonged to plant complex-type structures. Most of the complex glycans were fucosylated and xylosylated; some were fucosylated or xylosylated only."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 1998 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wroc\u0142aw University, Poland. olczak@bf.uni.wroc.pl"}], "LastName": "Olczak", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Watorek", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Acid Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acid Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Peptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9826432", "10.1006/abbi.1998.0927", "S0003-9861(98)90927-4"]}}]}
