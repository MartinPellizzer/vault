However, few studies have compared abundance, mobilization and selective pressures for ARGs in WWTPs as a function of variations in secondary treatment bioprocesses. We used shotgun metagenomics to provide a comprehensive analysis of ARG composition, relationship to mobile genetic elements and co-occurrences with antibiotic production genes (APGs) throughout two full-scale municipal WWTPs, one of which employs biofilm-based secondary treatment and another that uses a suspended growth system. Results showed that abundances of ARGs declined by over 90% per genome equivalent in both types of wastewater treatment processes. However, the fractions of ARGs associated with mobile genetic elements increased substantially between influent and effluent in each plant, indicating significant mobilization of ARGs throughout both treatment processes. Strong positive correlations between ARGs and APGs were found for the aminoglycoside antibiotic class in the suspended growth system and for the streptogramin antibiotic class in the biofilm system. The biofilm and suspended growth WWTPs exhibited similarities in ARG abundances, composition and mobilization trends. However, clear differences were observed for within-plant ARG persistence. These findings suggest that both biofilm and suspended growth-based WWTPs may promote genetic mobilization of persistent ARGs that are then disseminated in effluent to receiving water bodies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA."}], "LastName": "Petrovich", "ForeName": "Morgan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}], "LastName": "Chu", "ForeName": "Binh", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}], "LastName": "Wright", "ForeName": "Dorothy", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA."}], "LastName": "Griffin", "ForeName": "Jim", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}], "LastName": "Elfeki", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry & Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}], "LastName": "Murphy", "ForeName": "Brian T", "Initials": "BT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."}], "LastName": "Poretsky", "ForeName": "Rachel", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA."}], "LastName": "Wells", "ForeName": "George", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "FEMS Microbiol Ecol", "NlmUniqueID": "8901229", "ISSNLinking": "0168-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Waste Water"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2018 Nov 1;94(11). doi: 10.1093/femsec/fiy174", "PMID": "30239669"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metagenomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wastewater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29534199", "10.1093/femsec/fiy041", "4925569"]}}]}
