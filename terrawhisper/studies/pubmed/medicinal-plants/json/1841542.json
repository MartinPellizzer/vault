Two types of flour were prepared, testing four soaking temperatures (22, 30, 40 and 50 degrees C) and two methods to remove the testa (under moist and dry conditions). At laboratory level, the dry testa removal method gave the best flour yields (mean = 85.8%) and the highest protein content (mean = 23.7%). Comparison between soaking temperature at 30 and 50 degrees C was not significant (alpha = 0.05). At pilot plant level, with soaking at 50 degrees C the flour yields were 58.0% for moist testa removal (H1) and 74.0% for dry removal (H2), with a protein content of 22.6% for H1 and 23.0% for H2. The H1 and H2 flours were added to wheat flour at 5, 10 and 15% for bread making. The addition of 5.0% gave breads with similar protein content and sensory characteristics to those of the control, wheat. A diet based on bean-flour bread resulted in greater weight gains than that with casein for gold hamsters. The study also demonstrated the importance of heat-treating of the bean flours, because when flour without previous heat treatment was administered, the animals lost weight and died. This effect was overcome by the process of baking the flours at 140 degrees C for four hours."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales y Agropecuarias, Centro de Investigaciones Agr\u00edcolas de la Mesa Central (INIFAP-CIFAP), Chapingo, M\u00e9xico."}], "LastName": "V\u00e1squez Carrillo", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ortega Delgado", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Estrada Lugo", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Harina de frijol endurecido (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) en la preparaci\u00f3n de pan."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8DUH1N11BX", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptophan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cricetinae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Factor Analysis, Statistical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesocricetus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tryptophan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1841542"]}}]}
