At the same time, the prevalence of toxoplasmosis has been reported to be 30% worldwide. Traditional medicines have long played a vital role in discovering and developing novel drugs, and this approach is essential in the face of increasing resistance to current antimalarial and anti-Toxoplasma drugs. In Indonesian traditional medicine, various plants are used for their therapeutic properties. This study focuses on eleven medicinal plants from which nineteen extracts were obtained and screened for their potential medicinal benefits against malaria and toxoplasmosis.", "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of extracts from Indonesian medicinal plants to inhibit Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite responsible for malaria, and Toxoplasma gondii, an opportunistic parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis.", "Nineteen extracts from eleven plants were subjected to in vitro screening against P. falciparum 3D7 (a chloroquine-sensitive strain) and the T. gondii RH strain. In vitro treatments were conducted on P. falciparum 3D7 and K1 (multidrug-resistant strains) using the potent extracts, and in vivo assessments were carried out with mice infected with P. yoelii 17XNL. LCMS analysis was also conducted to identify the main components of the most effective extract.", "Seven extracts showed significant antiplasmodial activity (>80% inhibition) at a concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. These extracts were obtained from Dysoxylum parasiticum (Osbeck) Kosterm., Elaeocarpus glaber (Bl.) Bijdr., Eleutherine americana Merr., Kleinhovia hospita L., Peronema canescens Jack, and Plectranthus scutellarioides (L.) R.Br. Notably, the D. parasiticum ethyl acetate extract exhibited high selectivity and efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Herein, the key active compounds oleamide and erucamide were identified, which had IC<sub>50</sub> values (P. falciparum 3D7/K1) of 17.49/23.63\u00a0\u03bcM and 32.49/51.59\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.", "The results of this study highlight the antimalarial potential of plant extracts collected from Indonesia. Particularly, extracts from D. parasiticum EtOH and EtOAc stood out for their low toxicity and strong antiplasmodial properties, with the EtOAc extract emerging as a notably promising antimalarial candidate. Key compounds identified within this extract demonstrate the complexity of extracts' action against malaria, potentially targeting both the parasite and the host. This suggests a promising approach for developing new antimalarial strategies that tackle the multifaceted challenges of drug resistance and disease management. Future investigations are necessary to unlock the full therapeutic potential of these extracts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
