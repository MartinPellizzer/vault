These unique heterodimers are conjugates of germacranolide-type sesquiterpenoids with structurally diverse alkaloids [i.e., aporphine- (1-15), proaporphine- (16), and benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline-type (17)] via the formation of a C-N bond. The previously undescribed structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analyses and electronic circular dichroism calculations. Such a class of sesquiterpene-alkaloid hybrids presumably biosynthesized via an aza-Michael addition is quite rare from terrestrial plants. In particular, the sesquiterpene-benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline hybrid skeleton has never been reported until the present study. All the isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects against a small panel of leukemia cell lines (Raji, Jeko-1, Daudi, Jurkat, MV-4-11 and HL-60), and some of them exhibited considerable activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
