HPLC-DAD analysis was used for quantification. The inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 secretion in ConA stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was investigated.", "Eleven compounds were isolated and identified from the hot water extract of G. purpurea roots. Gentiopicrin, amarogentin, erythrocentaurin and gentiogenal showed dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 secretion. Gentiopicrin is the major secondary metabolite in the roots, while sweroside dominates in the leaves.", "The present work gives a comprehensive overview of the major low-molecular weight compounds in the water extracts of G. purpurea, including metabolites produced during the decoction process, and show new anti-inflammatory activities for the native bitter compounds as well as the metabolites produced during preparation of the crude drug."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
