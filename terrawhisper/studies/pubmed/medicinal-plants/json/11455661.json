The biologically active constituents of the Foeniculum fruits were characterized as the phenylpropenes (E)-anethole and estragole, and the monoterpene (+)-fenchone, by spectroscopic analysis. Responses varied with insect species, compound, dose and exposure time. In a filter paper diffusion test, estragole at 0.168 mg cm-2 caused 91% mortality to S oryzae adults within 1 day after treatment (DAT), whereas (+)-fenchone and (E)-anethole gave over 90% mortality at 2 and 4 DAT, respectively. Against C chinensis adults, all test compounds revealed potent insecticidal activities at 0.021 mg cm-2 at 2 DAT. Against L serricorne adults at 0.105 mg cm-2, (E)-anethole gave 100% mortality at 1 DAT, whereas 90 and 60% mortality at 4 DAT was achieved with estragole and (+)-fenchone, respectively. In a fumigation test, the compounds were much more effective against adults of S oryzae, C chinensis and L serricorne in closed cups than in open ones, indicating that the insecticidal activity of test compounds was largely attributable to fumigant action. As naturally occurring insect-control agents, the F vulgare fruit-derived materials described could be useful for managing field populations of S oryzae, C chinensis and L serricorne."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Suwon 441-744, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Camphanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Norbornanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1195-79-5", "NameOfSubstance": "fenchone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NIW07V3ET", "NameOfSubstance": "estragole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q3JEK5DO4K", "NameOfSubstance": "anethole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camphanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Fumigation"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Norbornanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11455661", "10.1002/ps.274"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
