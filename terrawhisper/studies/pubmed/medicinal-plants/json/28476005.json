In the present study, selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) with two different coatings (l-cysteine and tannic acid) were synthesized. The characteristics of particles were analyzed using XRD, FT-IR and SEM. The impact of the nanoparticles besides Se<sup>4+</sup>, on the aquatic higher plant Lemna minor was evaluated and compared. Entrance of l-cysteine and tannic acid capped Se NPs in the roots of Lemna minor was proved by TEM and fluorescence microscopy. Adverse effects of mentioned NPs and differences of these effects from those by sodium selenite as the ionic form were assessed by a range of biophysicochemical tests. Altogether, the results asserted that Lemna minor was notably poisoned by both capped Se NPs and Se<sup>4+</sup>. Thus, growth and photosynthetic pigments were decreased while lipid peroxidation along with total phenol and flavonoid contents were raised. Eventually some changes in enzymatic activities were presented. To sum up the consequences, it can be concluded that all changes occurred due to the plant defense system especially in order to remove reactive oxygen species (ROS) and possible phytotoxicity originated by l- cysteine and tannic acid capped Se NPs in addition to Se<sup>4+</sup>. The influence of tannic acid capped Se NPs after sodium selenite is stronger by the means of antioxidant enzymes activity in comparison with l-cysteine capped Se NPs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
