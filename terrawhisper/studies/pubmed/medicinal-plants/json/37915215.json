Samples purified using different proportions of alcohol solvents and by freezing/thawing were compared, while drying was performed by lyophilisation and atomisation in a spray. No significant statistical differences were observed in the yield of the purification process compared with the evaluated methods. Thus, the freezing/thawing method has economic and environmental advantages over other methods. Drying by spraying and lyophilisation produced particles exhibiting different properties in terms of structure: \u03b2-sheets, random sheets, and \u03b2-turns. In general, these particles are amorphous. The particles obtained by spray drying were more luminous, soluble, and spherical. Thus, purification by freezing/thawing and drying by spray can be considered appropriate methodologies for obtaining contaminant-free sericin through sustainable environmental technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, State University of Western Paran\u00e1, Toledo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Sone", "ForeName": "Ana Paula", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, State University of Maring\u00e1, Maring\u00e1, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gimenes", "ForeName": "Marcelino Luiz", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0020-9002"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professional Master's Program in Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines in Primary Care, and Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology Applied to Agriculture, University of Paran\u00e1, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Hoscheid", "ForeName": "Jaqueline", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professional Master's Program in Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines in Primary Care, University of Paran\u00e1, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Tominc", "ForeName": "Getulio Capello", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Biotechnology Applied to Agriculture, University of Paran\u00e1, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dalmagro", "ForeName": "Mariana", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Paran\u00e1, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Zardeto", "ForeName": "Giuliana", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Postgraduate Program in Animal science with an Emphasis on Bioactive Products, University of Paran\u00e1, Umuarama, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Donadel", "ForeName": "Guilherme", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, State University of Western Paran\u00e1, Toledo, Paran\u00e1, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Morejon", "ForeName": "Camilo Freddy Mendoza", "Initials": "CFM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37915215", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2276387"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
