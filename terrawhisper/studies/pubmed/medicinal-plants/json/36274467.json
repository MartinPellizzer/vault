The bioactive natural compounds can efficiently treat this disease with lesser side effects. Thus, in this study, a natural stilbene B10 (3-methoxy 5-hydroxy stilbene) isolated from Cajanus cajan (Pigeon Pea) was screened for its anti-proliferative efficacy against 13 cancer cell lines. B10 showed a potential effect on the human lymphoma (Raji) cells. Cytotoxicity analysis of B10 has revealed IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations in Raji cells at low doses (18\u00a0\u00b5M) than other cancer cell lines. The B10 could significantly cause dose and time-dependent inhibition in the proliferation of Raji cells triggering intrinsic apoptosis and S/G<sub>1</sub> phase cellular arrest. There was an increased expression of phospho-\u03b3-H2A.X and decreased expression of cyclin D1, causing DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, post- B10 treatments. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) variations observed after B10 treatment led to changes in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome C release, and enhanced expression of cleaved caspase3, 9, PARP-1, and APAF-1. The B10 inhibited the proliferation of Raji cells by significantly downregulating the expression of KRAS, BTK, MDM2, P-JAK2, P-STAT3, PI3K, HDAC1/2, SIRT7, and EP300. The treatment upregulated the tumor suppressor genes PEBP1 and SAP18. Thus, the study could reveal the selective inhibitory effects of B10 on lymphoma, suggesting it as a probable innovative chemotherapeutic agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
