Plants possess essential oils that exhibit various medicinal properties, i.e., anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti- inflammatory, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory, etc., due to the presence of various phytoconstituents, including terpenes, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and esters. An understanding of conventional and advanced extraction techniques of Essential Oils (EOs) from several plant sources is further required before considering or loading EOs into drug delivery systems. Therefore, this article summarizes the various extraction techniques of EOs and their existing limitations. The in-built biological applications of EOs are of prerequisite importance for treating several diseases. Thus, the mechanisms of action of EOs for anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial activities, etc., have been further explored in this article. The encapsulation of essential oils in micro or nanometric systems is an intriguing technique to render adequate stability to the thermosensitive compounds and shield them against environmental factors that might cause chemical degradation. Thus, the article further summarizes the advanced drug delivery approaches loaded with EOs and current challenges in the future outlook of EOs for biomedical applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Yenepoya Pharmacy College Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, Karnataka, 575018, India."}], "LastName": "Sultana", "ForeName": "Rokeya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Yenepoya Pharmacy College Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, Karnataka, 575018, India."}], "LastName": "Mohanto", "ForeName": "Sourav", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Yenepoya Pharmacy College Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, Karnataka, 575018, India."}], "LastName": "Bhunia", "ForeName": "Adrija", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, P.O.
