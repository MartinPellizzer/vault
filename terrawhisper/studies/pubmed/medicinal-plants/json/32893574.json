The basic physical and chemical properties of soil and its water characteristic parameters were also determined. The result showed as fllows:\u2460The bulk density of mixed coniferous-broad leaf forest soil was between 0.33 and 0.52 g\u00b7cm~(-3), significantly lower than the corresponding value of field soil(1.01-1.18 g\u00b7cm~(-3))(P&lt;0.05), While the organic matter content was significantly higher than the corresponding value of field soil(P&lt;0.05). \u2461The saturated water content(\u03b8_s), field water holding capacity(\u03b8_(FC)) and Water that can be effectively utilized by plants(\u03b8_(PAC)) of mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest soil were significantly higher than the corresponding value of field soil(P&lt;0.05), while the retained water content(\u03b8_r) value that cannot be effectively utilized by plants was significantly lower than that of field soil(P&lt;0.05). \u2462The values of structural porosity(0.13-0.24 cm~3\u00b7cm~(-3)) and Matrix porosity(0.34-0.44 cm~3\u00b7cm~(-3)) of mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest soil were higher than the corresponding values of field soil. Therefore, with low bulk density and high content of organic matter, mixed coniferous-broadleaved forest soil can store more water in soil in the form of effective water to meet the needs of plants for water, thus possibly forming high quality medicinal materials of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix. In conclusion, the results of this study can provide theoretical basis guidance for soil structure improvement and water management to form high quality medicinal materials in the artificial cultivation of N. incisum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Lan", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sichuan University Chengdu 610065, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "DU", "ForeName": "Jiu-Zhen", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wen-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Bing", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shun-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tracheophyta"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32893574", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200506.102"]}}]}
