Additionally, Morocco is renowned for its rich plant diversity and traditional medicinal uses, which inspires us to leverage our cultural heritage and the abundance of natural resources in our country for therapeutic purposes. In this study, an extensive investigation was conducted to gather a collection of phytoconstituents extracted from Moroccan plants, aiming to evaluate their ability to inhibit the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Molecular docking of the studied compounds was performed at the active sites of the main protease (6lu7) and spike (6m0j) proteins to assess their binding affinity to these target proteins. Compounds exhibiting high affinity to the proteins underwent further evaluation based on Lipinski's rule and ADME-Tox analysis to gain insights into their oral bioavailability and safety. The results revealed that the two compounds demonstrated strong binding affinity to the target proteins, making them potential candidates for oral antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The molecular dynamics results from this computational analysis supported the overall stability of the resulting complex."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Abchir", "ForeName": "Oussama", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Nour", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Engineering, Systems, and Applications, National School of Applied Sciences, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah-Fez University, Fes, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Daoui", "ForeName": "Ossama", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Yamari", "ForeName": "Imane", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Engineering, Systems, and Applications, National School of Applied Sciences, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah-Fez University, Fes, Morocco."}], "LastName": "ElKhattabi", "ForeName": "Souad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "El Kouali", "ForeName": "Mhammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Talbi", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Errougui", "ForeName": "Abdelkbir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Molecular Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences Ben M'Sik, Hassan II University of Casablanca, Casablanca, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Chtita", "ForeName": "Samir", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37966948", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2281002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
