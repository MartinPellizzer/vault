Here we evaluated in vitro embryotoxicity tests (IVTs) as alternative methods in assessing developmental toxicity of CHMs. Ten CHMs were selected and classified as strongly, weakly and non-embryotoxic. Three well validated IVTs and prediction models (PMs), including embryonic stem cell test (EST), micromass (MM) and whole embryo culture (WEC), were compared. All strongly embryotoxic CHMs were predicted by MM and WEC PM2. While all weakly embryotoxic CHMs were predicted by MM and WEC PM1. All non-embryotoxic CHMs were classified by EST, MM, but over-classified as weakly embryotoxic by WEC PM1. Overall predictivity, precision and accuracy of WEC determined by PM2 were better than EST and MM tests. Compared with validated chemicals, performance of IVTs for CHMs was comparable. So IVTs are adequate to identify and exclude embryotoxic potential of CHMs in this training set."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
