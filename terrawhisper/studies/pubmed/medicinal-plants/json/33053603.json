Elevated levels of total cholesterol, and particularly LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are the main risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ischemic heart disease. The risk of CVDs could be reduced by decreasing the elevated cholesterol levels. \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) is the primary and rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Recently, the crucial role of nutraceuticals in maintaining normal physiological function was established. Nutraceuticals play an important role in preventing several non-communicable diseases such as obesity, CVDs, cancer, diabetes, and reducing hyperlipidemia. Although the effect of nutraceuticals and herbal medicine on CVDs and dyslipidemia was previously investigated thoroughly, the effect of these natural products on HMGCoAR as one of the important enzymes involved in CVDs etiopathogenesis has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the major aim of this paper was to review the effects of nutraceuticals and medicinal plants on HMGCoAR. Results indicate that different types of natural foods, isolated nutrients, herbal products, and dietary supplements as nutraceuticals decrease the expression and activity of HMGCoAR. This review shows that medicinal plants and nutraceuticals could be used to decrease HMGCoAR activity as accessible and convenient and economical natural compounds to prevent dyslipidemia and CVDs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Food Security Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Atena", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Security Research Center, Department of Community Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Science, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Anesthesia and Critical Care Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bagherniya", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dental research center, Department of Periodontics, Dental research institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fakheran", "ForeName": "Omid", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia."}], "LastName": "Reiner", "ForeName": "\u017deljko", "Initials": "\u017d"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Suowen", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8656-1444"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Halal Research Center of IRI, FDA, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital Research Institute (PMMHRI), Lodz, Poland."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biofactors", "NlmUniqueID": "8807441", "ISSNLinking": "0951-6433"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypercholesterolemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Balakumar P, Maung-U K, Jagadeesh G.
