Flavonoids have shown beneficial effects on many aspects of human physiology and health. Recently, many flavonoids with various activities have been discovered, which has led to more and more studies focusing on their physiological and pharmacodynamic activities. The anticancer and anti-viral activities especially have gained the attention of many researchers. Therefore, the discovery and development of flavonoids as anti-disease drugs has great potential and may make a significant contribution to fighting diseases. This review focus on the discovery and development of flavonoids in medicinal chemistry in recent years."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Linyi Central Hospital, No.17 Jiankang Road, Linyi 276400, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Cancer Biology and Biomedical Engineering, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Zhi-Gang", "Initials": "ZG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Linyi Central Hospital, No.17 Jiankang Road, Linyi 276400, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi-Na", "Initials": "ZN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Room 205, BIO-X white house, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, No.1954 Huashan Road, Shanghai 200030, P.R.
