This study was undertaken to establish the role of nutrition knowledge on dietary choices and habits of people in Calabar, especially after the hard COVID-19 lockdown, and to ascertain if there was any positive or negative effect on the lifestyle of the people. It consisted of a cross-sectional survey in Calabar, Cross River State - Nigeria. An online questionnaire was prepared after sample size determination and its content validated. The questionnaire was designed to obtain data on the socio-economic status, participants' lifestyle, and changes in dietary intake/health before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, while the questionnaire link was in circulation for 6 weeks (April/May 2021). Descriptive statistics was used to define the proportion of responses for each question and Pearson's correlation was used to check for association between variables. Most participants were undergraduates depending on parents/sponsors. Financial decline appeared to have contributed to a post lockdown decrease in food consumption. Many (82.6%) respondents recorded high nutrition knowledge scores (NKS) and 83.1% of the respondents had high health scores. The results show that NKS influenced the kind of foods the respondents consumed frequently and there was a positive correlation between NKS consumption of fruits/vegetables. NKS had effect on their access to healthy foods and it varied significantly with respondent's total health score. No association existed between NKS and the reason for skipping meal - 'lack of time to prepare meals'. Nutrition knowledge and proper awareness, contributed significantly in dietary choices (regardless of limited resources), thus ensuring adequate nutrition and reduced health problems (most respondents recorded high health scores) during a pandemic. This study affirms the effectiveness of adequate nutrition education and awareness in ensuring healthy dietary choices, promoting optimal health, and reducing risks of diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism & Hospitality, College of Business & Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Onyenweaku", "ForeName": "Eridiong", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Fila", "ForeName": "Winifred", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Calabar, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akpanukoh", "ForeName": "Andyno", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Uyo Teaching Hospital, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Kalu", "ForeName": "Muriel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism & Hospitality, College of Business & Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Food and Nutrition Research, Institute of Medical Research and Medicinal Plants Studies, Yaounde, Cameroon."}], "LastName": "Tchuenchieu Kamgain", "ForeName": "Alex", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food Evolution Research Laboratory, School of Tourism & Hospitality, College of Business & Economics, University of Johannesburg, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Kesa", "ForeName": "Hema", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Frison E., Smith I., Johns T., Cherfas J., Eyzaguirre P.
