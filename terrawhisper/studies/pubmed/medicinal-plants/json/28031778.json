The percentage yield, duration of extraction, volume of solvent used, qualitative and quantitative phytoconstituents present was compared. The biological activities (hypoglycemic effect) were investigated using albino wistar rat model of diabetes mellitus (<i>n</i> = 36) with a combined dose (1:1) of the two plants leaf extracts (250 mg/kg b.w.) from the three methods. The extracts were administered orally, once daily for 21 d.", "In this report, the percentage VA extract yield from MAE was highest (20.9% \u00b1 1.05%) within 39 min using 250 mL of solvent, when compared to the CM (14.35% \u00b1 0.28%) within 4320 min using 900 mL of solvent and SE (15.75% \u00b1 0.71%) within 265 min using 500 mL of solvent. The percentage differences in OG extract yield between: MAE <i>vs</i> SE was 41.05%; MAE <i>vs</i> CM was 46.81% and SE <i>vs</i> CM was 9.77%. The qualitative chemical analysis of the two plants showed no difference in the various phytoconstituents tested, but differs quantitatively in the amount of the individual phytoconstituents, as MAE had significantly high yield (<i>P</i> > 0.05) on phenolics, saponins and tannins. SE technique gave significantly high yield (<i>P</i> > 0.05) on alkaloid, while CM gave significant high yield on flavonoids. The extracts from CM exhibited a significantly (<i>P</i> > 0.05) better hypoglycemic activity within the first 14-d of treatment (43.3% \u00b1 3.62%) when compared to MAE (36.5% \u00b1 0.08%) and SE methods (33.3% \u00b1 1.60%). However, the percentage hypoglycemic activity, 21 d post-treatment with 250 mg/kg b.w. extract from MAE was 72.6% \u00b1 1.03% and it was more comparable to 10 mg/kg b.w. glibenclamide treated group (75.0% \u00b1 0.73%), unlike the SE (69.5% \u00b1 0.71%) and CM (69.1% \u00b1 1.03%).", "CM technique produces extract with better hypoglycemic activity, whereas; MAE is a better option for high yield of phytoconstituents using less solvent within a short time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben Okoduwa, Directorate of Research and Development, Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, Zaria 810004, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Okoduwa", "ForeName": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben", "Initials": "SI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben Okoduwa, Directorate of Research and Development, Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, Zaria 810004, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Umar", "ForeName": "Ismaila A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben Okoduwa, Directorate of Research and Development, Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, Zaria 810004, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "James", "ForeName": "Dorcas B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben Okoduwa, Directorate of Research and Development, Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, Zaria 810004, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Inuwa", "ForeName": "Hajara M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Stanley Irobekhian Reuben Okoduwa, Directorate of Research and Development, Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, Zaria 810004, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Habila", "ForeName": "James D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "World J Diabetes", "NlmUniqueID": "101547524", "ISSNLinking": "1948-9358"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict-of-interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest related to this study and publication."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Okoduwa SI, Umar IA, Ibrahim S, Bello F, Habila N.
