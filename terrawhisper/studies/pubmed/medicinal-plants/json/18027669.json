A high performance liquid chromatography method determinated the scutellarin concentration in rat plasma and tissue. The plasma samples were performed by solid phase extraction method. The other biological samples were extracted by ethyl acetate.", "The range of scutellarin in plasma and tissue in rats were 10-1280 ng x mL(-1) (R2 > 0.99), 40-1280 ng x g(-1) (R2 > 0.99), respectively. The lowest detection of scutellarin were 10 ng x mL(-1) and 40 ng x g(-1), the precision were less than 8%. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of scutellarin were as follows: tmax, Cmax, AUC and MRT being (7.7 +/- 0.9) h, (288.0 +/- 75.2) microg x L(-1), (5.6 +/- 1.6) microg x mL(-1) x h(-1), (17.5 +/- 1.4) h(-1), respectively.", "These methods applied the study of pharmacokinetics of scutellarin.
