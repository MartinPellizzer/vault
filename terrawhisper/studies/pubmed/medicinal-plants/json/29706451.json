The accumulation of bioelements in the hair followed the statistical Power Law and the resulting sigmoid curve can be zoned into five regions in the ascending order of abundance (Low, Marginal, Adequate, High, and Excessive). The Adequate linear region of the bioassay sigmoid curve may be further subdivided into Low adequate, Recommended, and Ample adequate sub regions in a 60:30:10 ratio. Phosphorus was the most invariant bioelement since its hair concentration varies minimally regardless of the geographical place of living, the twenty years' time interval between the analyses, sex, race and instrumentation, i.e., atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) atomic emission spectrometry (AES), and inductively plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS). The osteotrophic (bone seeking) bioelements: Ca, Mg, and Sr, were 2.5 times more abundant in the hair of women than men. Two principal electrolytes of the body (Na, K) of the multi-bioelement hair profile were markedly increased in the depressed subjects diagnosed according to the American Psychiatric Association MSD-IV classification criteria. This increase in the hair Na and K of the depressed subjects was also associated with the decrease of vasopressin in the peripheral blood. The factor analysis revealed strong association of depression with sex (women > men in a 2.5:1 ratio), and with the metals from the Nieboer-Richardson series which form strong covalent bonds with proteins. We propose that the biological roots of depression are related to the non-specific impairment of the intracellular osmotic balance and ionic gradient due to the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase failure from whatever cause acting either separately or in combination. We also put forward the idea of how children's autism may be related to a disproportional growth rate of various organs and tissues if children are fed up to their maximal genetic growth capacity. Finally, we have suggested the hypothesis on how the syntax or integration of the internal metabolic wiring of the bioelements in the body may occur. We have suggested the hypothetical existence of two complex distinct five-bioelement \"rotors\", the P-rotor and the N-rotor, where the P-rotor integrates the mileau interior (Na, K) ions with the perception/excitability (Mg, Ca) ions. Thus, the complex five element interdependence is cross related to P which provides the energy from the phosphorus of the DNA nucleotide backbone. The hair multi-bioelement profile analysis allows us to envisage the more complex structural metabolic features that bioelements are playing in our bodies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier GmbH.
