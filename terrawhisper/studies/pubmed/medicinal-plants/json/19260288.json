It was noted that tumor formation postponed in mice treated with the n-butanol and polysaccharides extracts from CN compared with the control panel and tumor growth became slower; The n-butanol and polysaccharides extracts from CN could also greatly enhance the life span of mice with H22 ascitic tumors by 116.43%, 44.52%, 20.54%, 109.52%, 112.61% and 115.01%, respectively.
