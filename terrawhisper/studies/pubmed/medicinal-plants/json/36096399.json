To improve the drug delivery efficiency, two branched amphiphilic peptides (BAPs) were designed in a computer-aided manner, for drug-loading through peptide self-assembling. The structures of the two BAPs, bis(LVFFA)-K-RGD (PepV-1) and bis(FHF)-K-RGD (PepV-2), were inspired by phospholipids, containing the RGD sequence as the hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic sequences as the hydrophobic tails. PepV-1 could self-assemble into nano-fibrils with a hydrophobic core and the RGD moiety on the surface. Its drug-loading efficiency (DE%) of three small molecule anticancer drugs (doxorubicin, camptothecin and curcumin) ranged from 9.90% to 11.74%, and entrapment efficiency (EE%) ranged from 37.30% to 43.00%. Pep-V2 could self-assemble into bilayer delimited nano-vesicles. The DE% of PepV-2 for these drugs ranged from 15.87% to 18.55%, and the EE% ranged from 60.45% to 73.23%. Both BAP carriers could prolong the release of the small molecule drugs, and the PepV-2 vesicles also showed pH-triggered increase of drug release due to the histidine residues. Bothe BAP carriers could increase the cytotoxicity against cancer cells, which might be due to the targeting on the cancer overexpressed integrins. The designed BAP carriers represent promising functional drug carriers for targeted drug delivery, and will be useful for improving the clinical use of small molecule drugs, especially for those with poor water solubility."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
