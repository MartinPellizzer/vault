In this regard, telemedicine is a breakthrough technology to battle against the COVID-19 emergency. Therefore, we sought to identify the telemedicine applications in the COVID-19 pandemic (tele-COVID) according to interaction modes, transmission modalities, and disease categories. This systematic review was conducted through searching five databases including PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Science Direct. Inclusion criteria were studies clearly outlining any use of telemedicine interactive mode during the COVID-19 pandemic, written in English language and published in peer-reviewed journals in 2020. Finally, 43 articles met the inclusion out of the 1118 search results. Telemedicine provides a diversity of interaction modes and modalities affordable by patients and physicians including short message service, E-mail and web portals, secure telephone calls or VOIP, video calls, interactive mobile health applications (m-Health), remote patient monitoring, and video conferencing. Transmission of video data using synchronized video calls via common social media had the highest and exchange of data using store-forward service via secure messaging technology and prerecorded multimedia had the lowest popularity for virtual disease management during the COVID-19 outbreak. Selection of telemedicine communication services and interaction modes with regard to its use-case, disease category, and application plays a significant role in the success of remote disease management infrastructures in this scenario and their implication for a better future healthcare system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2021 Journal of Education and Health Promotion."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Information Technology, School of Paramedical, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shanbehzadeh", "ForeName": "Mostafa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Heath Information Technology, Abadan University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Abadan University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi-Arpanahi", "ForeName": "Hadi", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Abadan University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kalkhajeh", "ForeName": "Sasan Ghorbani", "Initials": "SG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Basati", "ForeName": "Gholam", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Educ Health Promot", "NlmUniqueID": "101593794", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9531"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Araz OM, Ramirez-Nafarrate A, Jehn M, Wilson FA.
