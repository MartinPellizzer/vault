Screening of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry, and Therapeutics (IMPPAT) using virtual high-throughput screening coupled with enzyme assay suggested that Naringenin (NAG) could be a potent inhibitor of MARK4. Structure-based molecular docking analysis showed that NAG binds to the critical residues found in the active site pocket of MARK4. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies for 100\u2009ns have delineated the binding mechanism of NAG to MARK4. Results of MD simulation suggested that binding of NAG further stabilizes the structure of MARK4 by forming a stable complex. In addition, no significant conformational change in the MARK4 structure was observed. Fluorescence binding and isothermal titration calorimetric measurements revealed an excellent binding affinity of NAG to MARK4 with a binding constant (K)\u2009=\u20090.13\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> obtained from fluorescence binding studies. Further, enzyme inhibition studies showed that NAG has an admirable IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.11\u2009\u00b5M for MARK4. Together, these findings suggest that NAG could be an effective MARK4 inhibitor that can potentially be used to treat cancer and neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Anwar", "ForeName": "Saleha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3D), University of Cape Town, Rondebosch, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Shama", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Shamsi", "ForeName": "Anas", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Anjum", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Shafie", "ForeName": "Alaa", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9060-7970"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Asimul", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Faizan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3663-4940"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jamia Nagar, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Md Imtaiyaz", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogen Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "MARK4 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HN5425SBF2", "NameOfSubstance": "naringenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Estrogen Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Sammak PJ, Borisy GG.
