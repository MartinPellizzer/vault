However, ecological and quality suitability are not always a coincidence, which makes traditional cultural regionalization for TCM cultivation based on ecological suitability have great limitations in practical applications. A regionalization method integrated GIS and medicinal plants quality have been analyzed by using field quality data of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix as a case study. Spatial interpolation based on medicine quality by Cokriging method is reasonable, and the predicted values of interpolation are correlated with measured values significantly, which shows that cultural regionalization for TCM cultivation based on spatial quality suitability is possible theoretically. The results indicate that the most suitable areas for quality suitability were mainly distributed in Sichuan province (29.42%), while the spatial distribution of quality suitability and ecological suitability was not coincidence. The cultivation regionalization of TCM plants based on quality suitability is helpful to high quality and quantity cultivation of those TCM plants which spatial distribution of geoherbalism and ecological suitability is separated."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Bing", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shun-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Wen-Tao", "Initials": "WT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crop Production"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Geographic Information Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spatial Analysis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29098814", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170614.008"]}}]}
