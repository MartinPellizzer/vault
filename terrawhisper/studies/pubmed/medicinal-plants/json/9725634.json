All are means +/- s.e.m. The carcass of CN rats had 58, 20 and 13% more fat than TE, TN and CE rats, respectively; P < 0.01. Lean body mass was the same for all the groups of rats and ranged from means of 216-228 g. However, TE rats had significantly more fat free dry mass (FFDM) than CN rats; 68 +/- 4 vs 58 +/- 2 (means +/- s.e.m.) and tended to have more FFDM than TN and CE rats. Inguinal fat depots weighed 20-30% less in T than in C rats (diet comparisons) and also 20-30% less in E than in N rats (exercise comparisons). Perirenal/retroperitoneal fat depots weighed 25% less in TN than in CN rats and 38% less in TE than in CE rats. Exercise did not reduce perirenal/retroperitoneal fat depot weights. Parametrial fat depot weights were not influenced by diet or exercise.", "In diets which provided 37% of the energy from fat, the incorporation of tepary beans attenuated weight gain, and subcutaneous and visceral fat gain compared to a purified type diet. Exercised rats gained less weight and subcutaneous, but not visceral fat, than non-exercised rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physical Education and Exercise Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824, USA."}], "LastName": "Burch", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schemmel", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "VanHeest", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rodgers", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord", "NlmUniqueID": "9313169"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Adipose Tissue"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Composition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet, Reducing"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Obesity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Physical Conditioning, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Zucker"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9725634", "10.1038/sj.ijo.0800652"]}}]}
