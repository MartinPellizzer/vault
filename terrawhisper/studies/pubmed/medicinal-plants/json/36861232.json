Cassia absus plant parts have been traditionally used to treat inflammatory conditions. This study was designed for evaluating anti-arthritic, anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential of Cassia absus seeds. n- hexane, methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts were prepared to be appraised for identification and quantitative determination of various phytochemicals. All the extracts were evaluated for anti-arthritic activity via protein denaturation, anti-nociceptive activity by hot plate method and anti-inflammatory potential through Carrageenan induced paw edema. Three doses; 100, 200 and 300mg/kg of each extract were given to Wistar rats. The results of the quantitative analysis revealed that Aqueous and n-hexane extracts contained the highest total flavonoid (104.2\u00b10.24mg QE/g) and phenolic contents (187.4\u00b10.65mg GA/g) respectively. All the extracts exhibited decrease in protein denaturation (n-hexane 66.66%, methanol 59.42%, chloroform 65.21% and aqueous extract 89.85%). Significant increase in mean latency time (secs) was observed in n-hexane, methanol and aqueous extract treated rats as compared to normal rats. All four extracts caused significant reduction in paw inflammation as compared to carrageenan control. It is therefore concluded that all the extracts of Cassia absus possessed significant anti-arthritic, anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore.
