In this updated systematic review, the search terms were \"multiple sclerosis\" or \"neurodegeneration\" and (\"natural compounds\" or \"medicinal plants\", \"traditional medicine\" or \"native medicine\").", "Studies with vitamins (A, B12, D, H), minerals (selenium and lithium), n-3 PUFAs, lipoic acid, statins, resveratrol, marijuana, EGCG and some probiotics have shown significant helpful effects in MS by preventing or delaying the onset of disease. Other natural compounds such as xanthines, anthocyanins, glucosinolates, isoflavones, organosulfurs, steroid glycosides, and alkaloids have also shown protective effects in the treatment of MS in animal models. Adverse effects were also reported in some of the experiments.", "Further studies with a focus on the molecular mechanisms of the protective natural compounds are needed to decrease possible side effects and to develop new medicines for MS. Apigenin, chrysin, baicalein, cyanidin, flavone glycoside, daidzein, coumestrol, sulforaphane, bee venom and huperzine A are the candidates for more prospective investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Zabol, Zabol, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurodegeneration Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sanadgol", "ForeName": "Nima", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zahedani", "ForeName": "Shahram Shahraki", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurodegeneration Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Toxicology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khalseh", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Barbari", "ForeName": "Gullam Reza", "Initials": "GR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Toxicology and Diseases Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdollahi", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Sclerosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27829351", "10.2174/1389450118666161108124414", "CDT-EPUB-79589"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
