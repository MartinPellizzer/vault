In this study, we examined the role of the endogenous digitalis-like substance in the development of hypertension. Four groups of rats were studied: 1) 25% RRM rats with STZ-induced IDDM (25-DM), 2) normal rats with STZ-induced IDDM (2K-DM), 3) 25% RRM rats with vehicle treatment (25-V), and 4) normal rats with vehicle treatment (2K-V). In 25-DM rats, blood pressure progressively increased during the 3 weeks after STZ treatment and was associated with microalbuminuria, low plasma renin activity, and extracellular volume expansion. In contrast, the 2K-DM, 25-V, and 2K-V rats remained normotensive. Furthermore, the plasma and urine levels of digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DIF), determined by digoxin radioimmunoassay (Baxter), were significantly higher in hypertensive 25-DM rats than in their controls. The same was the case for plasma digitalis-like substance (DLS), determined by exposing canine Na+,K(+)-ATPase to plasma fractions and observing the percent inhibition. Increased DIF and DLS in hypertensive 25-DM rats was associated with a significant decrease in Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of microsomes prepared from the left and right ventricles, when compared with microsomes from normotensive 2K-DM animals. Microsomal 5'-nucleotidase, a plasma membrane marker, was unchanged. The DIF and DLS correlated significantly with each other and with myocardial Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity and mean blood pressure. These results suggest that increased endogenous digitalis-like substance, which inhibits cardiovascular muscle cell Na(+)-K(+)-pump activity, may be involved in the mechanism of hypertension associated with IDDM in 25% RRM rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Clough", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schooley", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haddy", "ForeName": "F J", "Initials": "FJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pamnani", "ForeName": "M B", "Initials": "MB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Hypertens", "NlmUniqueID": "8803676", "ISSNLinking": "0895-7061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetic Angiopathies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nephrectomy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioimmunoassay"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Urine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8390268", "10.1093/ajh/6.5.397", "0895-7061(93)90203-X"]}}]}
