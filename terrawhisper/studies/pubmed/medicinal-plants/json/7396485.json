The results indicated that increasing acidity is, in general, accompanied by decreasing heat resistance, although the pH effect was more pronounced at the higher than at the lower processing temperatures. Certain pH values appear to be critical, as they produced, in all three sets of experiments, effects which would not be predicted by the overall relationship between acidity and spore heat resistance. Differences between heat resistance in phosphate buffer as compared with that in pea puree adjusted to the same pH were also noted. D-values in buffer were found to be lower than those in pea puree, except at the highest temperatures coupled with the lowest pH values. The differences between buffer D-value and pea puree D-value were found to increase with increasing pH and with decreasing temperature. On the other hand, at all pH values examined, z-values determined in buffer were somewhat higher than those determined in pea puree adjusted to the same pH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cameron", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leonard", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Barrett", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Buffers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphates"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Buffers"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Clostridium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Appl Bacteriol. 1972 Mar;35(1):119-21", "ArticleIdList": ["5025431"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1976 Apr;31(4):492-8", "ArticleIdList": ["5056"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1977 Jul;34(1):23-9", "ArticleIdList": ["329760"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7396485", "PMC291456", "10.1128/aem.39.5.943-949.1980"]}}]}
