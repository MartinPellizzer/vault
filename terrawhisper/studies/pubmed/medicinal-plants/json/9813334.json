Here, GalNAc-specific Vicia villosa B4 lectin was found to inhibit hydrolysis of UDP-GalNAc by animal nucleotide pyrophosphatases, which are suggested to regulate local levels of nucleotide sugars in cells. Inhibition was marked at low concentrations of UDP-GalNAc, and was reversed largely by the addition of GalNAc to the reaction mixture. In contrast, lectin inhibited enzymatic hydrolysis of other nucleotide sugars, such as UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcNAc, only to a small extent, and GalNAc did not affect such an inhibition. The binding constant of the lectin for UDP-GalNAc was as high as 2.8 x 10(5) M-1 at 4 degrees C, whereas that for GalNAcalpha-1-phosphate was 1.3 x 10(5) M-1. These findings indicate that lectin inhibition of pyrophosphatase activity toward low concentrations of UDP-GalNAc arises mainly from competition between lectin and enzyme molecules for UDP-GalNAc. This type of inhibition was also observed to a lesser extent with GalNAc-specific Wistaria floribunda lectin, but not apparently with GalNAc-specific soybean or Dolichos biflorus lectin. Thus, V. villosa B4 lectin shows unique binding specificity for UDP-GalNAc and has the capacity to modulate UDP-GalNAc metabolism in animal cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Legal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. a2takeya@marianna-u.ac.jp"}], "LastName": "Takeya", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hosomi", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kogure", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vicia lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7277-98-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylgalactosamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "nucleotide pyrophosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylgalactosamine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9813334", "10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00074-9", "S0304-4165(98)00074-9"]}}]}
