A good separation of organic acids extracted from a mixture of Chinese traditional medicine (TCM) containing three herbs, Flos chrysthemi, Spica prunellae, and Folium mori was obtained using the procedure developed with satisfactory working range (0.20-77 mg/g), low detection limit (90-190 microg/g), and good repeatability (relative standard deviation 4.47-6.99%, n = 4). A satisfactory extraction of organic acids was achieved within 20 min using 0.1 M NaOH. The addition of TEPA to provide a reduced electroosmotic flow (EOF) environment was shown to remove interfering organic compounds extracted from TCM. The applicability of using organic acids as markers for determining the mixing ratio of constituent herbs for a TCM mixture was investigated using a three-component mixture with a 1:1:1 mixing ratio. A satisfactory mixing ratio of 1.04:1.09:0.98 was obtained using the methodology developed based on organic acids as markers. The application of our method for determining more complicated TCM mixtures has been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Applied Spectroscopy and Analytical Sciences, Department of Chemistry, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China. ysfung@hkucc.hku.hk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fung", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tung", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Electrophoresis", "NlmUniqueID": "8204476", "ISSNLinking": "0173-0835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Buffers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Buffers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Capillary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11504059", "10.1002/1522-2683(20017)22:11<2242::AID-ELPS2242>3.0.CO;2-E", "10.1002/1522-2683(20017)22:11<2242::AID-ELPS2242>3.0.CO;2-E"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
