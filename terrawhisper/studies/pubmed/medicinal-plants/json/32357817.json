However, at an advanced stage, cancer cells become less susceptible because of the multidrug resistance and the recruitment of alternative salvage pathways for their survival. Besides, owing to target non-selectivity, healthy proliferating cells also become vulnerable to the damage. The combination therapies offered using flavonoids to cure cancer not only exert an additive effect against cancer cells by targetting supplementary cell carnage pathways but also hampers the drug resistance mechanisms. Thus, the review aims to discuss the potential and pharmacokinetic limitations of flavonoids in cancer treatment. Further successful synergistic studies reported using flavonoids to treat cancer has been described along with potential drug delivery systems.", "A literature search was done by exploring various online databases like Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar with the specific keywords like \"Anticancer drugs\", \"flavonoids\", \"oncology research\", and \"pharmacokinetics\".", "Dietary phytochemicals, mainly flavonoids, hinder cell signalling responsible for multidrug resistance and cancer progression, primarily targeting cancer cells sparing normal cells. Such properties establish flavonoids as a potential candidate for synergistic therapy. However, due to low absorption and high metabolism rates, the bioavailability of flavonoids becomes a challenge. Such challenges may be overcome using novel approaches like derivatization, and single or co-delivery nano-complexes of flavonoids with conventional drugs. These new approaches may improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of flavonoids.", "This review highlights the application of flavonoids as a potential anticancer phytochemical class in combination with known anti-cancer drugs/nanoparticles. It also discusses flavonoid's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics issues and ways to overcome such issues. Moreover, it covers successful methodologies employed to establish flavonoids as a safe and effective phytochemical class for cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Yusuf", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Luqman", "ForeName": "Suaib", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Molecular Bioprospection Department of Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow-226015, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Abha", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32357817", "10.2174/1568026620666200502005411", "CTMC-EPUB-106279"]}}]}
