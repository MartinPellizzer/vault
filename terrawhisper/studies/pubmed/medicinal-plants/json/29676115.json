Meanwhile, it could provide scientific basis for enhancing wild population quantity recovery. The results showed that more population quantity grow in the habitats of large-area gap (Population A) and bushes (Population C) with a majority of the young individuals, while the minor-area gap (Population B) was the opposite. The development tendency of S. hexandrum populations would be the recession in the future. Spatial distribution pattern of populations was clumped at small scales but random at large scales. The indexes of population A and C, as fruit size\uff0cthe quantity and quality of seeds\uff0cgerm inability\uff0cwere all superior to those of population B. Comparing the mainly environment factors of three populations, that favorable environmental factors for vegetative and reproductive growth of S. hexandrum populations were found\uff0cespecially certain lighting intensity and fertile soil. Therefore, the favorable environmental habitats for S. hexandrum individuals growth could be artificial to promote the recovery and quantities of S. hexandrum populations in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Forest Resources & Environment of Guizhou\uff0c Guizhou University\uff0c Guiyang 550025\uff0c China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xizang Agriculture and Huabandy College\uff0c Linzhi 860000\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qi-Qiang", "Initials": "QQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Forest Resources & Environment of Guizhou\uff0c Guizhou University\uff0c Guiyang 550025\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture, Guizhou University\uff0c Guiyang 550025\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-E", "Initials": "HE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xizang Agriculture and Huabandy College\uff0c Linzhi 860000\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xizang Agriculture and Huabandy College\uff0c Linzhi 860000\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yan-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Berberidaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endangered Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29676115", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180110.002"]}}]}
