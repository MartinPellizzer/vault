Well-diffusion method was utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the extracts. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis of the extract revealed the presence of 27 compounds. Phenolic and flavonoid contents were found in high amount (7\u00b76-18\u00a0mg GAE, mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> ; 3\u00b72-10\u00b78\u00a0mg catechin, mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> ) in dry plant material.", "Among all the extracts, 2-Hexadecen-1-ol and beta sitosterol were the major constituents of crude extract and exhibited significant antioxidant potential as well antimicrobial activity; however, all other fractions also exhibited fare degree of antioxidant potential. 93% DPPH was scavenged by 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup> of the ethyl acetate fraction; in ABTS assay chelation was 86\u00b72 and 88% in ferric chloride reducing power assay.", "Schimpera arabica is naturally present and used in food preparation in most Arabian nations. The characterization of S. arabica would provide an insight into its medicinal use as home remedial for bacterial infection and as antioxidant. Significant and comparable antimicrobial activity was demonstrated by both 2-Hexadecen-1-ol and beta sitosterol fractions. The results suggest that S. arabica contain a good amount of natural antioxidants of medicinal importance.
