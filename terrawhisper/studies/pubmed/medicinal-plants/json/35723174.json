In this regard, EO yield and composition and their antioxidant activity of citron fruit at four fruit maturity stages, i.e. the green mature (GM), intermediate (INT), yellow ripe (MAT) and overripe stage (OR) were studied. Obtained results showed significant effect of fruit maturity on most measured properties. The concentration of EO varied between 0.60 and 0.77% (v/w). The highest amount of limonene was 89.39% related to GM stage. The limonene decreased significantly during maturity. The highest antioxidant activity (76.08%) was measured at the OR stage, which is probably due to the presence of specific compounds in the EO and their synergistic effects. The phytochemical behaviors of this citron variety were different as relation to stages of fruit maturity. We can determine the ideal harvest period for maximum bioactive substances by recognizing these actions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0691-4351"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Jahrom University, Jahrom, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghani", "ForeName": "Askar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9576-6273"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taghvaeefard", "ForeName": "Nehleh", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7398-6902"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security Research Group, Yasuj Branch, Islamic Azad University, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseinifarahi", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1538-0582"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Biotechnology Center in Borj Cedria Technopole, Hammam-Lif, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Dakhlaoui", "ForeName": "Sarra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4826-8041"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Biotechnology Center in Borj Cedria Technopole, Hammam-Lif, Tunisia."}], "LastName": "Msaada", "ForeName": "Kamel", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Environ Health Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9106628", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3123"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9MC3I34447", "NameOfSubstance": "Limonene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Limonene"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Citrus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35723174", "10.1080/09603123.2022.2084514"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
