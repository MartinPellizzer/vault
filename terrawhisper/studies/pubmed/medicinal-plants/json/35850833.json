Compared with leaves of E.ulmoides, 7 575 unigenes were more highly expressed in stems, of which 462 were involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.Our results extend the public transcriptome dataset of E.ulmoides, which provide valuable information for the analysis of biosynthesis pathways of lignan and lignin in E.ulmoides and lay a foundation for further study on the functions and regulation mechanism of key enzymes in lignan and lignin biosynthesis pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Center for Scientific Research and Techenology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuai-Shuai", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Center for Scientific Research and Techenology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Li-Qiang", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Center for Scientific Research and Techenology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Jing-Yao", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Center for Scientific Research and Techenology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038, China."}], "LastName": "Shan", "ForeName": "Chun-Miao", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Xin'an Medicine, Ministry of Education, Center for Scientific Research and Techenology, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230038, China Anhui Academy of Chinese Medicine Hefei 230012, China Synergetic Innovation Center of Anhui Authentic Chinese Medicine Quality Improvement Hefei 230012, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jia-Wen", "Initials": "JW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Eucommiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35850833", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220414.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
