However, this chemistry is difficult to investigate because the compounds are often short-lived and prone to degradation under the conditions required for analysis by common analytical techniques. This issue has complicated efforts to study the defense chemistry of plants that exploit the use of sulfur in their defense arsenals. This work illustrates how direct analysis in real time-high resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) can be used to track organosulfur defense compound chemistry under mild conditions. Petiveria alliacea was used as a model plant that exploits the enzyme alliinase to generate induced organosulfur compounds in response to herbivory. Tracking of the organosulfur compounds it produces and quantifying them by DART-HRMS using isotopically labeled analogues revealed a feedback inhibition loop through which the activities of the alliinase are stymied shortly after their activation. The results show that the downstream thiosulfinate products petivericin (100 \u03bcM) and pyruvate (8.4 mM) inhibit alliinase activity by 60% and 29%, respectively, after 1 h, and a mixture of the two inhibited alliinase activity by 65%. By 2 h, alliinase activity in the presence of these alliinase-derived products had ceased completely. Because thiosulfinate, pyruvate, and lachrymatory sulfine compounds are produced via the same alliinase-derived sulfenic acid intermediate, the inhibition of alliinase activity by increasing concentrations of downstream products shows how production of these defense compounds is modulated in real time in response to a tissue breach. These findings provide a framework within which heretofore unexplained phenomena observed in the defense chemistry of P. alliacea, onion, garlic, and other plants can be explained, as well as an approach by which to track labile compounds and enzymatic activity by DART-HRMS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , State University of New York at Albany , 1400 Washington Avenue , Albany , New York 12222 , United States."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Tianyu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , State University of New York at Albany , 1400 Washington Avenue , Albany , New York 12222 , United States."}], "LastName": "Chambers", "ForeName": "Megan Isabella", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3135-4130"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry , State University of New York at Albany , 1400 Washington Avenue , Albany , New York 12222 , United States."}], "LastName": "Musah", "ForeName": "Rabi Ann", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "S-benzyl phenylmethanethiosulfinate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "S-benzyl-cysteine sulfoxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfinic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8558G7RUTR", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "alliin lyase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon-Sulfur Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feedback, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytolaccaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfinic Acids"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30222323", "10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03295"]}}]}
