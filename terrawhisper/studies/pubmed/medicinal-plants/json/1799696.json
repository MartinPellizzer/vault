Both proteins contain a signal sequence and are cleaved to mature proteins of Mr 5 kDa as indicated by an in vitro translation system. The mature proteins contain about 17% cysteine residues and have the potential to form four disulfide bonds. The two proteins share extensive homology in their signal sequences but much less homology as mature proteins. The cysteine residues of the mature proteins are highly conserved, suggesting functional importance. Southern hybridization suggests these genes belong to a multigene family. The relative accumulations of mRNA levels indicate that the two genes are expressed somewhat differentially. In both the compatible (susceptible) and incompatible reactions between F. solani and pea tissue, pI39 mRNA accumulates more slowly than pI230 mRNA and accumulates to relatively high levels after 24 hr of inoculation. The increase in accumulation of pI230 mRNA occurs within 6 hr and thus correlates with an initial suppression of the growth of both the compatible and incompatible pathogen, which is cytologically observable at 6 hr. pI39 and pI230 belong to a distinct class of pathogenesis-related proteins characterized previously, which are associated with and thus may contribute to nonhost resistance in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Program in Genetics and Cell Biology, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6430."}], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hadwiger", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Plant Microbe Interact", "NlmUniqueID": "9107902", "ISSNLinking": "0894-0282"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Sorting Signals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["pI230", "pI39"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell-Free System"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Sorting Signals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restriction Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1799696", "10.1094/mpmi-4-324"]}}]}
