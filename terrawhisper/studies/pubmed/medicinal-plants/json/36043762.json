Because targeted therapeutics are unavailable, scientists have the opportunity to discover new drugs or vaccines to counter COVID-19, and therefore a number of synthetic bioactive compounds are now being tested in clinical studies. Due to its broad therapeutic spectrum and low adverse effects, medicinal herbs have been used as traditional healing medication in those countries for ages. Due to a lack of synthetic bioactive antiviral medications, pharmaceutical and alternative therapies have been developed using a variety of herbal compositions. Due to the widespread availability of herbal and dietary products worldwide, people frequently use them. Notably, the majority of Bangladeshi people continue to use a variety of natural plants and herbs to treat various types of diseases. This review article discusses how previous research has shown that some herbs in Bangladesh have immunomodulatory and antiviral effects and how their active ingredients have been gathered. Even though FDA-approved medications and vaccines are available for the treatment of COVID-19, the purpose is to encourage the use of herbal medicine as immunomodulators and vaccine adjuvants for the treatment of COVID-19 prevention."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Daffodil International University, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Md Mominur", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Earth and Ocean Science, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Maritime University, Mirpur 12, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Shohag", "ForeName": "Sheikh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Daffodil International University, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Islam", "ForeName": "Md Rezaul", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Faculty of Earth and Ocean Science, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Maritime University, Mirpur 12, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Akhter", "ForeName": "Shomaya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, Daffodil International University, Dhaka 1207, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Mim", "ForeName": "Sadia Afsana", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Ayurveda,Department of Rasa Shastra & Bhaishajya Kalpana, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Rohit", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Swabi, Anbar 23561, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rauf", "ForeName": "Abdur", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101240303", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4064"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "31", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "4"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36043762", "10.2174/1573406418666220829144746", "MC-EPUB-125985"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
