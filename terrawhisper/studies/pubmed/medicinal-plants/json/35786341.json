However, research on alternative medicine such as phytochemicals cannot be ignored. The main reason for prominent curiosity about phytochemicals stems from the belief that usage of natural compounds is safer and has lesser detrimental side effects.", "The aim of the present review was to discuss in detail with several phytochemicals that have been studied or are being studied in the context of various neurological disorders including depression, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and even neuroinflammatory disorders such as encephalitis.", "The potential role of phytochemicals in the treatment or management of symptoms associated with neurological disorders have been included in this article. All data included in this paper has been pooled from various databases including Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer and Wiley Online Library.", "Phytochemicals have been widely studied for their therapeutic properties associated with neurological disorders. Using various experimental techniques for both in vivo and in vitro experiments, studies have shown that phytochemicals do have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities which play major roles in the treatment of neurological diseases.", "Even though there has been compelling evidence of the therapeutic role of phytochemicals, further research is still required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these medicines. Using previously published papers as foundation for additional research such as preclinical studies and clinical trials, phytochemicals can become a safer alternative to synthetic drugs for treating a spectrum of neurological diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRM Nagar, Kattankulathur-603203, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}], "LastName": "Jayaraman", "ForeName": "Megala", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRM Nagar, Kattankulathur-603203, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}], "LastName": "Dutta", "ForeName": "Parijat", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRM Nagar, Kattankulathur-603203, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}], "LastName": "Krishnan", "ForeName": "Sabari", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRM Nagar, Kattankulathur-603203, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}], "LastName": "Arora", "ForeName": "Khyati", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, SRM Nagar, Kattankulathur-603203, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Dental Sciences, University Sains Malaysia, 16150, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia"}], "LastName": "Sivakumar", "ForeName": "Diveyaa", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Clinical Research, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Central Research Facility, Porur, Chennai-600116, India"}], "LastName": "Raghavendran", "ForeName": "Hanumanth Rao Balaji", "Initials": "HRB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269155", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5273"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "20"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["35786341", "10.2174/1871527321666220701153926", "CNSNDDT-EPUB-124961"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
