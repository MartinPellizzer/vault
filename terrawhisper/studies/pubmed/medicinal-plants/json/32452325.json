This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorative effect of methanolic extracts of Nigella sativa (MENS) against cadmium-induced blood oxidative stress and testicular toxicity in albino rats.", "Twenty-five (25) male albino rats, weighing (200 \u00b1 20g), were randomly grouped into five groups (A-E). Group B (Negative Control) received intraperitoneal administration of cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mg/kg) only, group C received CdCl<sub>2</sub> and low dose MENS (300 mg/kg, oral), group D received CdCl<sub>2</sub> and high dose MENS (600 mg/kg, oral), group E (Positive control) received CdCl<sub>2</sub> and Vitamin C (200 mg/kg, oral), for 14 days. No treatment was administered to group A (Normal control). The oxidative state of the blood was assessed by measuring the blood levels or activities of MDA, CAT, GSH and SOD; while testicular injury was assessed by measuring serum testosterone level using ELISA. The testes were harvested for histopathological examination.", "The results showed that cadmium induced a marked elevation in the level of MDA, and a decrease in SOD, CAT and GSH levels or activities (p<0.05 or p<0.01); but no significant alteration in the serum testosterone level was found (p>0.05); Histopathological studies on the testes showed that cadmium significantly induced testicular injury, which was however ameliorated by the seed extract of N. sativa.", "We conclude that N. sativa seed extract is potentially testiculoprotective and attenuates oxidative stress against harmful chemical toxins such as cadmium."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Nigeria, Enugu, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Uchendu", "ForeName": "Ikenna Kingsley", "Initials": "IK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Okoroiwu", "ForeName": "Henshaw Uchechi", "Initials": "HU"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J6K4F9V3BA", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nigella sativa"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32452325", "10.2174/1386207323666200526134923", "CCHTS-EPUB-106929"]}}]}
