According to the secretory volume and rhythm of testosterone and cortisol, the Shixiang Yaofa's drugs were used.

Wenyang jihuo bead 10 g x kg(-1) of crude drug, ziyin xiuyang capsule 4 g x kg(-1) of crude drug pd for hight doses in animals. Other groups for low doses 5 g x kg(-1) and 2 g x kg(-1) of crude drug pd for 15 days. The blood samples were collected for determination.", "(1) In human bodies the peak value of testosterone was appeared in 8:00 and valley value was appeared in 18:00, ranges: 176.93-281.73 x 10(-5) mg x L(-1). The peak value of cortisol was appeared in 8:00 and valley value was appeared in 22:00, ranges: 1.31-16.13 x 10(-3) mg x L(-1). In the same condition, the mouse peak value of testosterone was appeared in 20:00 and valley value was appeared in 0:00, ranges: (0.56 x 10(-5) - 124.0 x 10(-5)) mg x L(-1). The rhythm in animals was compatible with human bodies, howerer, the peak value was delayed for 12 hours. (2) The testosterone was step up and the cortisol was cut down in sports fatigued human bodies and animals when shixiang yaofa's drug were used (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).", "The secretion of testosterone and cortisol in sports fatigued human bodies and animals are existed conclusive biologic rhythm.
