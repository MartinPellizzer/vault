All phenolic constituents were separated in <26\u00a0min on reversed-phase C18 column with gradient mobile phase that consists of orthophosphoric acid, methanol and acetonitrile. Detections were made on an UV detector at 280\u00a0nm and at a flow rate of 1\u00a0mL/min. Samples were prepared according to Masqueller's conventional sample preparation method with slight modifications. To avoid the reduction in extraction efficiency the sample preparation step was carried out under argon atmosphere. The linearity of the method was between 0.9994 and 0.9999. The detection limits for the five phenolic constituents ranged from 0122 to 0.324\u00a0mg/L. Catechin and taxifolin were found in all pine barks at a concentration of 0.065\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002-1.454\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004 and 0.015\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001-23.164\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.322\u00a0mg/g, respectively. Epicatechin was determined in four pine barks between 0.027\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 and 0.076\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002\u00a0mg/g, ferulic acid in two pine barks between 0.010\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001 and 0.022\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001\u00a0mg/g and epicatechin gallate in only one of the pine barks at 0.025\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001\u00a0mg/g. Finally, the total amount of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities of the pine barks were found to be very high."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
