However,most of the major producing regions of medicinal plants suffer from rust disease,which threatens the yield and quality of Chinese medicinal materials,thus causes huge economic loss,and hinders the sustainable development of the Chinese medicine industry. By the end of 2020,rust disease had been reported in medicinal plants of 76 species and 33 families. In the 76 species,79 rust pathogens were detected. The majority of these pathogens belonged to Puccinia( 33,39. 24%),Coleosporium( 14,15. 19%),and Aecidium( 11,13. 92%). Of these 79 rust pathogens,10 were autoecious and 13 were heteroecious. Through literature research,this study reviewed the symptoms,pathogen species,severity and distribution,prevalence and occurrence conditions,and control measures of rust disease in medicinal plants,and thereby summarized the research status of rust disease in medicinal plants and the gap with other plants,which is expected to serve as a reference for further research on rust disease in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhong-Lian", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Mei-Yan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Tian-Jian", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Institute of Medicinal Plant Cultivation Chongqing 408435,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Qian", "Initials": "CQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "57"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34402279", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210227.104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
