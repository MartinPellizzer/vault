Patients below 55 significant dominated the last-mentioned group. Among the patients, 53% believed that the products could strengthen their immune system, while 18% believed that they could contribute in their fight against cancer. However, as many as 62% answered \"I don't know\" to this question. As to what was true about the products, 86% found it difficult to judge, and 76% wanted information primarily from health personnel. One third had discussed the products with the doctor. Only 8% felt this to be very useful; hence communicating with cancer patients about herbs and dietary supplements can be a challenge, though at least it might help to discover side effects or interaction with the medicine given."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Farmas\u00f8ytisk seksjon, Farmas\u00f8ytisk Institutt, Universitetet i Oslo, Postboks 1068 Blindern, 0316 Oslo. rolf.johansen@farmasi.uio.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johansen", "ForeName": "Rolf", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toverud", "ForeName": "Else-Lydia", "Initials": "EL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Norske kreftpasienter og helsekostmarkedet--hva brukes og hvorfor?"}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Norway", "MedlineTA": "Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen", "NlmUniqueID": "0413423", "ISSNLinking": "0029-2001"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Food, Organic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["diet therapy", "drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Education as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Physician-Patient Relations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16541172", "1354845"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
