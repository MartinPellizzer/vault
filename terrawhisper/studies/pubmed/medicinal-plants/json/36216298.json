Particularly, HJH from Huazhou (HZ) county of Guangdong province has been well-regarded as the best national product for geo-herbalism. But the reasons for geo-herbalism property in HJH from HZ county remains a mystery. Therefore, a multi-omics approach was applied to identify the nature of the geo-herbalism in CGT from three different regions. The comprehensive screening of differential metabolites revealed that the Nobiletin content was significantly different in HZ region compared to other regions, and could be employed as a key indicator to determine the geo-herbalism. Furthermore, the high-quality genome (N50 of 9.12\u00a0Mb), coupled with genomics and transcriptomics analyses indicated that CGT and Citrus grandis are closely related, with a predicted divergence time of 19.1 million years ago (MYA), and no recent WGD occurred in the CGT, and the bioactive ingredients of CGT were more abundant than that of Citrus grandis. Interestingly, Nobiletin (Polymethoxyflavones) content was identified as a potential indicator of geo-herbalism, and O-methyltransferase (OMT) genes are involved in the synthesis of Polymethoxyflavones. Further multi-omics analysis led to the identification of a novel OMT gene (CtgOMT1) whose transient overexpression displayed significantly higher Nobiletin content, suggesting that CtgOMT1 was involved in the synthesis of Nobiletin. Overall, our findings provide new data resources for geo-herbalism evaluation, germplasm conservation and insights into Nobiletin biosynthesis pathways for the medicinal plant C. grandis 'Tomentosa'."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
