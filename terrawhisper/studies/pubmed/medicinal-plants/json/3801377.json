(control group) compared with lotus given to sheep receiving intraruminal polyethylene glycol (PEG) infusion (PEG group). PEG selectively binds to tannins and prevents tannins from binding proteins. DM intakes (1430 (SE 28) g/d) and digestibility of energy (663 (SE 4.5) kJ/MJ intake) were similar for both groups but the apparent digestion of nitrogen was lower in the control sheep (0.70) than in the PEG sheep (0.78; P less than 0.001). The proportion of N apparently digested before the abomasum (i.e. in the rumen) was lower (P less than 0.05) in control sheep (0.12) than in PEG sheep (0.21; P less than 0.05). Rumen ammonia concentrations were lower (P less than 0.001) in control sheep than in PEG sheep. The proportion of neutral-detergent fibre (NDF) digested in the rumen was similar for both groups (0.48 (SE 0.012)) but less energy was digested in the rumen of the control (0.42) than of the PEG sheep (0.47; P less than 0.05). The flux of essential amino acids (EAA) through the abomasum of control sheep was 50% greater than that in PEG sheep; flux of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) was 14% higher in control than in PEG sheep. Apparent digestibility of EAA in the small intestine was similar for both treatments (0.67), but NEAA were less well digested in the control (0.55) than in the PEG sheep (0.69). The presence of tannins in the control group increased net apparent absorption of threonine (57%), valine (89%), isoleucine (94%), leucine (30%), tyrosine (41%), phenylalanine (93%), histidine (90%) and lysine (59%), and reduced NEAA absorption by 10%, compared with PEG sheep."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waghorn", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ulyatt", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "John", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fisher", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0372547", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1145"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Abomasum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Large"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intestine, Small"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3801377", "10.1079/bjn19870015", "S0007114587000163"]}}]}
