Total mixed diets were composed of (dry matter) 40% concentrate mix, 24.5% chopped alfalfa hay, and 35.5% corn silage. Concentrate mixes contained 0, 25, 50, and 75% chickpeas in place of corn and soybean meal. Diets were fed individually for 80 d. Average daily gains (.98, 1.13, 1.14, and .95 kg) were higher for heifers fed 25 and 50% chickpeas than for those fed 0 and 75% chickpeas. Feed per gain (4.72, 4.05, 3.65, and 4.01 kg/kg) was lower for all diets containing chickpeas. Dry matter intake was lowest for heifers fed 75% chickpeas, and dry matter intake as percent of body weight was similar for all groups. Ruminal ammonia, pH, total volatile fatty acid concentrations, and ratio of acetate to propionate were similar for all diets. Serum urea and rumen parameters displayed no trends between diets. Chickpeas were an acceptable replacement for corn and soybean meal in growing heifer diets."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dairy Science Department, South Dakota State University, Brookings 57007-0647."}], "LastName": "Illg", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sommerfeldt", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boe", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3680739", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(87)80272-2", "S0022-0302(87)80272-2"]}}]}
