Increased evidence has revealed that plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have colonized the halophytic rhizosphere, and they have evolved the capacity to reduce salt stress damage to the host. However, the mechanism by which halophytes attract and recruit beneficial PGPR has rarely been reported. This study reports the interaction between the halophyte Limonium sinense and its rhizosphere PGPR strain Bacillus flexus KLBMP 4941, as well as the mechanism by which KLBMP 4941 promotes host plant growth under salt stress. After salt stress treatment, we collected the root exudates (REs) of L. sinense and found that the REs could promote the growth and chemotaxis of the bacterium KLBMP 4941. In addition, the components of the REs under salt stress were analyzed, and some organic acids (2-methylbutyric acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid) were detected as the major components. Further assessment showed that each of these components had positive effects on the growth, motility, chemotaxis, and root colonization of strain KLBMP 4941. Further pot experiments revealed the potential PGP mechanisms induced by strain KLBMP 4941 on the host plant under salt stress. Inoculation with KLBMP 4941 promoted the accumulation of chlorophyll to enhance photosynthesis, increased osmotic regulator contents, enhanced flavonoid and antioxidant enzymes, and regulated Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis to help the host ameliorate salinity stress damage. Our findings indicate that the halophyte L. sinense can attract and recruit beneficial rhizosphere bacteria by REs under salt stress, and the recruited B. flexus KLBMP 4941 elicited PGP effects under salinity stress through complex plant physiological regulatory mechanisms. This study provides a foundation for the enhancement of the rhizosphere colonization ability of the PGP strain KLBMP 4941, which shows potential applications in phytoremediation of saline soils."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
