This method involves a one-step extraction of 2-5\u00a0mg of lyophilized plant material followed by fractionation of different biogenic amine forms and exploits an efficient combination of hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), reversed phase (RP) chromatography with pre-column derivatization, and tandem mass spectrometry. This approach enables high-throughput processing of plant samples, significantly reducing the time needed for analysis and its cost. We also present a new synthetic route for deuterium-labelled polyamines. The LC-MS/MS method was rigorously validated by quantifying levels of nitrogen-related metabolites in seedlings of seven plant species including Arabidopsis, maize, and barley, all of which are commonly used model organisms in plant science research. Our results revealed substantial variations in the abundance of these metabolites between species, developmental stages, and growth conditions, particularly for the acetylated and methylated derivatives and the various polyamine fractions. However, the biological relevance of these plant metabolites is currently unclear. Overall, this work contributes significantly to the field of plant science by providing a powerful analytical tool and setting the stage for future investigations into the functions of these nitrogen-related metabolites in plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
