The present study represents the first report investigating the impact of the active molecule chlorogenic acid (CGA), naturally isolated from Moringa oleifera leaf extract (EMOLE), on immunosuppressed, Cryptosporidium parvum-infected BALB/c mice. Mice were divided into five groups: normal mice, infected immunosuppressed mice, and infected immunosuppressed mice treated with EMOLE, CGA, and nitazoxanide (NTZ) drugs. Parasitological, immunological, and histopathological investigations were recorded besides differences in the mice' body weight. Infected control mice showed elevated levels of oocyst shedding throughout the study. The EMOLE- and CGA-treated groups showed 84.2% and 91.0% reductions in oocyst shedding, respectively, with no significant difference compared to the drug control. The inflammatory markers IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly higher in the infected control group. Treatment with 300 mg/kg/day of EMOLE or 30 mg/kg/day of CGA significantly downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels compared to the infected group, although they did not change significantly compared to the NTZ-treated group. Histopathology of intestinal sections showed inflammatory and pathological changes in the infected control group. Low-grade tissue changes and an obvious improvement in villi structure were seen in mice treated with CGA. This study highlighted the role of CGA, isolated and purified from EMOLE, as an effective anti-inflammatory agent in eradicating C. parvum infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Laboratory, Theodor Bilharz Research Institute, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hamad", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, Suez Canal University, Egypt."}], "LastName": "El Sherif", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al Abdulsalam", "ForeName": "N K", "Initials": "NK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biological Sciences Department, College of Science, King Faisal University, Al Ahsa 31982, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, Desert Research Center El-Mataria, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abd El-Moaty", "ForeName": "H I", "Initials": "HI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Trop Biomed", "NlmUniqueID": "8507086", "ISSNLinking": "0127-5720"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "SOA12P041N", "NameOfSubstance": "nitazoxanide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Moringa oleifera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cryptosporidium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37356003", "10.47665/tb.40.1.010"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
