The protective action of crude extracts of Phyllanthus emblica fruits (PFE) against lead (Pb) and aluminium (Al)-induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) was studied in bone marrow cells of Mus musculus. The modifying effect of the crude extract was compared with that of comparable amounts of synthetic ascorbic acid (AA), a major component of the fruits. Oral administration of PFE or AA for 7 consecutive days before exposure of mice to the metals by intraperitoneal injections reduced the frequencies of SCEs induced by both metals. PFE afforded a more pronounced protective effect than AA in counteracting the genotoxicity induced by both Al and Pb: This difference was significant with Pb. The higher protection afforded by PFE may be attributed to the interaction of AA with other natural ingredients present in the crude fruit extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, India."}], "LastName": "Dhir", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Roy", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Environ Mol Mutagen", "NlmUniqueID": "8800109", "ISSNLinking": "0893-6692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alum Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "34S289N54E", "NameOfSubstance": "aluminum sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6E5P1699FI", "NameOfSubstance": "lead nitrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Alum Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sister Chromatid Exchange"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8462526", "10.1002/em.2850210305"]}}]}
