Since the structural identification in 1964, much has been learned about its effects on the physiology of plants, about the interference with the action of plant hormones, the molecular nature of the plant receptor(s) for FC and the biosynthetic pathway for FC in the fungus. The finding that the plasma membrane H+-ATPase in combination with 14-3-3 proteins acts as high-affinity receptor for FC was a breakthrough in the field. Ever since, the binding of FC to the ATPase|14-3-3 receptor has taken center stage in explaining all FC induced physiological effects. However, a more critical review shows that this is not at all evident for a number of FC induced effects. Examples of this are: the inhibition of outward rectifying K+-channels in guard cells, the phosphorylation/activation of PEP-carboxylase and malate accumulation, the antagonism with ABA induced production of H2O2 / NO and the effect on ethylene production. In addition, recently two other physiological processes were shown to be targeted by FC, viz. the activation of TORC1 and the interference of FC with the immune response to fungal elicitors. In this review, the notion will be challenged that all FC affected processes start with the binding to and activation of the PM-ATPase and the question is raised whether may be other proteins with a key role in the respective processes are directly targeted by FC. A second unresolved question is whether FC may be another example of a fungal molecule turning out to be a 'copy' of an as yet unknown plant molecule; in analogy to the fungal product and plant hormone gibberellic acid. A relevant question in this respect is whether it is a coincidence that proteins that act in a coordinated fashion during stomatal opening (the ATPases and K+-channels) are targeted by FC? Or are the sites where FC binds in the plant, conserved during evolution because they serve a physiological role, namely the accommodation of a plant produced molecule? In view of the evidence, albeit not conclusive, that plants indeed produce 'FC-like ligands', it is worthwhile to make a renewed attempt with current day improved technology to answer this question and may be upgrade FC or structural analogue(s) to a new level, the level of plant hormone."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
