These surveys, conducted in the Maya Mountains, Belize, generate ethnobotanical, ecological, and geospatial data on species which are used by Q'eqchi' Maya healers in practice. Several of these mountainous species are regionally scarce and the healers are expressing difficulties in finding them for use in promotion of community health and wellness. Based on healers' input, zones of highest probability for locating regionally scarce, disappearing, and culturally important plants in their ecosystem niches can be facilitated by interactive modeling. In the present study, this is begun by choosing three representative species to train an interactive predictive model. Model accuracy was then assessed statistically by testing for independence between predicted occurrence and actual occurrence of medicinal plants. A high level of accuracy was achieved using a small set of exemplar data. This work demonstrates the potential of combining ethnobotany and botanical spatial information with indigenous ecosystems concepts and Q'eqchi' Maya healing knowledge via predictive modeling. Through this approach, we may identify regions where species are located and accordingly promote for prioritization and application of in situ and ex situ conservation strategies to protect them. This represents a significant step toward facilitating sustained culturally relative health promotion as well as overall enhanced ecological integrity to the region and the earth."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Sciences and Center for Healing Across Cultures, Cleveland State University, Cleveland, OH 44115, USA. t.pesek@csuohio.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pesek", "ForeName": "Todd", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abramiuk", "ForeName": "Marc", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garagic", "ForeName": "Denis", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fini", "ForeName": "Nick", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meerman", "ForeName": "Jan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cal", "ForeName": "Victor", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ecohealth", "NlmUniqueID": "101222144", "ISSNLinking": "1612-9202"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Belize"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Participation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community-Institutional Relations"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Health Promotion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Holistic Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indians, Central American"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Bull World Health Organ. 1985;63(6):965-81", "ArticleIdList": ["3879679"]}, {"Citation": "EMBO Rep. 2005 May;6(5):388-92", "ArticleIdList": ["15864284"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2003 May 15;423(6937):276-9", "ArticleIdList": ["12748639"]}, {"Citation": "J Ethnopharmacol. 2005 Aug 22;100(1-2):118-23", "ArticleIdList": ["15964728"]}, {"Citation": "Mem Cognit. 1985 May;13(3):208-17", "ArticleIdList": ["4046821"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2000 Feb 24;403(6772):853-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10706275"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19455273", "10.1007/s10393-009-0224-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
