Accumulation of both SATase and beta-PA/CSase in soluble extracts of E. coli was confirmed by immunoblotting. The high enzymatic activities of SATase and L-cysteine synthase (CSase) were detected in cell-free extracts of E. coli carrying pFK4. The activities of the formation of beta-PA and L-mimosine, plant non-protein amino acids, from O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and the precursor heterocyclic compounds, pyrazole and 3,4-dihydroxypyridine, were also found in the extracts. beta-PA was also produced in vivo from L-serine and pyrazole as precursors by E. coli cells transformed with pFK4. beta-PA was accumulated mainly in the extra-cellular culture medium. The pronounced accumulation of L-cysteine and L-methionine was observed in the cells transformed with pFK4. Additionally, we also constructed vectors which carried chimeric genes encoding fusion proteins of SATase and beta-PA/CSase. However, the fusion proteins tended to form insoluble inclusion bodies and thus to exhibit only weak enzymatic activities. The successful results of pFK4 shows the way to create a new sequential biosynthetic pathway of plant specific amino acids in bacterial cells by means of recombinant DNA technology."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medicinal Resources, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Inage-ku, Japan."}], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ikegami", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noji", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.3.1.30", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine O-Acetyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.47", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serine O-Acetyltransferase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9013806", "10.1248/bpb.20.47"]}}]}
