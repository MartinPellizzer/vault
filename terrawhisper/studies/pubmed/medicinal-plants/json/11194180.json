We have tested the cytoprotective, anti-secretory and ulcer healing actions of an alkaloid (TN) obtained from the fruit extract. Oral administration of TN (50-100 mg/kg) dose-dependently prevented ulcer formation by HCl/ethanol (36-75%), absolute ethanol (43-75%), HCl-ethanol/indomethacin (58-84%), Pylorus ligation (31-100%), cold restraint stress (68-100%) and histamine (49-100%). The inhibitory effect at 50 and 100 mg/kg against HCl/ethanol was not suppressed by pre-treatment with indomethacin (20 mg/kg, i.p.). TN reduced Shay-ligated gastric acid secretion from 77 mEq/l in the controls to 46 and 25 mEq/l for the 50 and 100 mg/kg doses. Augmented histamine-induced gastric acid secretion was reduced from 84 mEq/l in the controls to 45 and 21 mEq/l for the two doses of TN, with total inhibition of gastric and duodenal ulcers by the 50 mg/kg dose. Healing rate of chronic acetic acid-induced ulcers was 62 and 83%, respectively, for the dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg of TN compared with the controls. TN has gastric anti-secretory effects similar to histamine receptor blockers. Its cytoprotective and ulcer healing properties are related to its ability to strengthen gastric mucosal defenses through enhanced gastric mucus production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Biology and Physiology, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon. tanpaul@uycdc.uninet.cm"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyasse", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Histamine H2 Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "QTT17582CB", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrochloric Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cameroon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Juice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Histamine H2 Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrochloric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Peptic Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11194180", "10.1016/S0944-7113(00)80037-9", "S0944-7113(00)80037-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
