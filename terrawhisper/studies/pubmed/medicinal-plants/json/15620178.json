The flowering could be greatly advantaged by short-day light treatment (12, 10, 8, 6 h). Cultural practices were studied also in this experiment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Agronomy, Hebei Normal University of Science & Technology, Changli 066600, Hebei, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Ya-ke", "Initials": "YK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gui-lan", "Initials": "GL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-po", "Initials": "WP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Shu-guo", "Initials": "SG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Yin-fu", "Initials": "YF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sunlight"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15620178"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
