It may face some kinds of diseases caused by viruses, hepatotoxic chemicals, drugs, alcohol, and inherited disorders. Oxidative stress and inflammation are in the core of mechanisms of liver damages induced by viruses or chemical agents.", "Morus nigra (M. nigra), generally known as black mulberry, exhibited wide-spectrum pharmacological effects including antidiabetic, antinociceptive, anticancer, and hepatoprotective activities. Different parts of this plant particularly the fruit and leaf have shown beneficial effects on hepatocytes in cell culture and animal models of liver damages induced by chemicals (e.g., CCl4), drugs (e.g., paracetamol), diet (e.g., high fat), diabetes, etc. The beneficial effects of M. nigra on the liver are attributed to the presence of considerable amounts of phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins, flavonols, and phenolic acids. The present review is aimed to focus on the hepatoprotective activities of M. nigra and its phytochemicals and the mechanisms responsible for these activities. Key Messages: The evidence reviewed in this study can help design clinical trials on M. nigra in patients with liver disorders and develop a hepatoprotective herbal medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 S.
