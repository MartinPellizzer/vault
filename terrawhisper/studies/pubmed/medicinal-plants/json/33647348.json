Therefore, cancer prevention/treatment, targeting kinases with phytochemicals could be a promising approach. Given potential of phytochemicals in modulating cancer-associated kinases, present study aims to find inhibitory prospects of selected flavonoids for cancer-chemoprevention/treatment. The molecular docking interaction analysis was done by exploring binding potential of flavonoids with kinases (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, EGFR, MAPK, MKK4, Fyn, ZAP-70, B-Raf, JAK-2, STAT-1, STAT-3, STAT-4, STAT-5, and VEGF) involved in various carcinogenesis phases. Among flavonoids acacetin showed highest binding-energy against JAK-2 following Fyn\u00a0>\u00a0VEGF\u00a0>\u00a0PI3K\u00a0>\u00a0MKK4 > MAPK\u00a0>\u00a0BRaf\u00a0>\u00a0STAT-5 > STAT-1 > STAT-4 whereas pinostrobin depicts higher binding-energy with JAK-2 followed by B-Raf\u00a0>\u00a0MKK4 > VEGF\u00a0>\u00a0PI3K\u00a0>\u00a0MAPK\u00a0>\u00a0STAT-1 > STAT-4 > STAT-5. Further, molecular-dynamic simulation revealed that pinostrobin interacted with JAK-2 protein with binding-energy of -25.068\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.08\u00a0kJ/mol whereas acacetin interacted with both JAK-2 and Fyn with binding-energies of -23.466\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9508\u00a0kJ/mol and-8.935\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3108\u00a0kJ/mol respectively. High binding-energy, low inhibition-constant, and drug-likeness of acacetin and pinostrobin provide a clue for their usage as a JAK-2 inhibitor which could be useful for molecular/cell-target based in-vitro and in-vivo investigations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
