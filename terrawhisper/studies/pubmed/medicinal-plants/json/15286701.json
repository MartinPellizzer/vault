In this report, we show that parthenolide activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is independent of inhibition of NF-kappaB DNA binding and generation of reactive oxygen species. Parthenolide reversed resistance of breast cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. Cancer cells treated with a combination of TRAIL and parthenolide underwent massive typical apoptosis and atypical apoptosis involving the loss of plasma membrane integrity. JNK activity is necessary for the parthenolide-induced sensitization to TRAIL because a dominant-negative JNK or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced TRAIL plus parthenolide-induced apoptosis. Parthenolide induced phosphorylation of Bid and increased TRAIL-dependent cleavage of Bid without affecting caspase 8 activities. Cytochrome c but not Smac/DIABLO was released from the mitochondria in cells treated with parthenolide alone. Parthenolide through JNK increased the TRAIL-mediated degradation of the antiapoptotic protein X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). Enhanced XIAP cleavage correlated with increased and prolonged caspase 3 activity and PARP cleavage, suggesting that the sensitization to TRAIL involves 'feed forward' activation of caspase 3. These results identify a new antitumor activity of parthenolide, which can be exploited to reverse resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL, particularly those with elevated XIAP levels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA. hnakshat@iupui.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakshatri", "ForeName": "Harikrishna", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rice", "ForeName": "Susan E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhat-Nakshatri", "ForeName": "Poornima", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01-CA89153", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Oncogene", "NlmUniqueID": "8711562", "ISSNLinking": "0950-9232"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "TNFSF10 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tnfsf10 protein, mouse"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2RDB26I5ZB", "NameOfSubstance": "parthenolide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Knockout"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["deficiency", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15286701", "10.1038/sj.onc.1207995", "1207995"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
