A total of 192 volatile chemicals were identified in the extracts obtained by both methods using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). They included 47 monoterpenoids (oxygenated monoterpenes), 26 aromatic compounds, 19 aliphatic esters, 18 aliphatic alcohols, 17 monoterpenes (hydrocarbon monoterpenes), 17 sesquiterpenes (hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes), 13 sesquiterpenoids (oxygenated sesquiterpenes), 12 aliphatic aldehydes, 8 aliphatic hydrocarbons, 7 aliphatic ketones, and 9 miscellaneous compounds. The major volatile constituents of the extract by DRP were borneol (10.27 ppm), alpha-thujone (3.49 ppm), artemisia alcohol (2.17 ppm), verbenone (1.85 ppm), yomogi alcohol (1.50 ppm), and germacren-4-ol (1.43 ppm). The major volatile constituents of the extract by SPSE were 1,8-cineole (8.12 ppm), artemisia acetate (4.22 ppm), alpha-thujone (3.20 ppm), beta-caryophyllene (2.39 ppm), bornyl acetate (2.05 ppm), borneol (1.80 ppm), and trans-beta-farnesene (1. 78 ppm)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Toxicology, University of California, Davis 95616, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Umano", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hagi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakahara", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shoji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shibamoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatilization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10956134", "10.1021/jf0001738", "jf0001738"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
