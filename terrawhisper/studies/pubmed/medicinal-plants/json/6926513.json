The production ability of plants was established with both spring and autumn sowing, using different plant spacing (20 cm X 20 cm and 50 cm X 20 cm). All important poppy-growing areas within northern and southern Europe were represented by the cultivars brought under investigation (\"P-360\", \"Ankara\", \"Botosani\", \"Kompolti-M\", \"K\u00e9k Duna\", \"Modran\", \"KM-Ihar\" and \"Reading\"). The extension of the vegetation cycle by autumn sowing and wintering had a generally favourable effect on dry matter and alkaloid production, resulting in a fivefold increase in production. In spite of high production ability, the wintering of the cold-sensitive cultivars, known as spring types, was uncertain. The shortening of the vegetation cycle (spring sowing) seemed to be unfavourable for the production of both spring and autumn cultivars. However, that disadvantage was compensated to some extent by spring cultivars having relatively lower sensitivity and higher alkaloid production levels. The weight of individual plants was much higher when cultivated in large areas. However, a higher yield could be obtained with 20cm X 20cm spacing because more plants could be harvested per square metre. On the basis of production analyses, a negative correlation was established between the total capsule mass (i.e. capsule plus seed) and the ratio of the drug-forming part. In the case of alkaloid production, a positive correlation was established between the accumulation of codeine and the intensification of over-all alkaloid formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bern\u00e1th", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "T\u00e9t\u00e9nyi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Bull Narc", "NlmUniqueID": "2984719R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-523X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Northern Ireland"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6926513"]}}]}
