In this study, the effect of different light modes on rocket (Eruca sativa. Mill.) photosynthetic performance and other physiological traits was evaluated using an orthogonal design based on a combination between light intensity, quality, and photoperiod factors. Some morphological and biochemical parameters and photosynthetic efficiency of the plants were analyzed. Plants grew in a closed chamber where three light intensities (160, 190, and 220 \u03bcmol m-2 s-1) provided by LEDs with a combination of different ratios of red, green, and blue (R:G:B- 7:0:3, 3:0:7, and 5:2:3) and three different photoperiods (light/dark -10/14 h, 12/12 h, and 14/10 h) were used and compared with white fluorescent light (control). This experimental setup allowed us to study the effect of 9 light modes (LM) compared to white light. The analyzes performed showed that the highest levels of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids occurred under LM4, LM3, and LM1, respectively. Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurement showed that the best effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry Y(II), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and electron transport ratio (ETR) were obtained under LM2. The data showed that the application of R7:G0:B3 light mode with a shorter photoperiod than 14/10 h (light/dark), regardless of the light intensity used, resulted in a significant increase in growth as well as higher photosynthetic capacity of rocket plants. Since, a clear correlation between the studied traits under the applied light modes was not found, more features should be studied in future experiments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Elmardy", "ForeName": "Naif Ali", "Initials": "NA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6614-5566"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture, University of Al-Azhar (Branch Assiut), Assiut, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Yousef", "ForeName": "Ahmed F", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Kui", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Machine Learning and Intelligent Science, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiwen", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3092-6328"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Horticulture, Fujian Agricultural and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Muhammad Moaaz", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5003-9275"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Production Department, Faculty of Agriculture Saba Basha, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Lamlom", "ForeName": "Sobhi F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute of Biology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Technology and Life Sciences, National Research Institute, Falenty, Raszyn, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kalaji", "ForeName": "Hazem M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Vegetable and Medicinal Plants, Institute of Horticultural Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences-SGGW, Warsaw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Kowalczyk", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Machine Learning and Intelligent Science, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photoperiod"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Bell L, Methven L, Signore A, Oruna-Concha MJ, Wagstaff C.
