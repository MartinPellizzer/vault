The reproductive protective effect of UNA was evaluated in a mouse model of oligozoospermia induced by busulfan (BUS) at 30\u00a0mg/kg b.w.. The mice were initially divided into groups with UNA concentrations of 10, 30, 50, 100\u00a0mg/kg. Subsequently, based on sperm parameters, the optimal concentration of 50\u00a0mg/kg was identified. As a control, an additional group was supplemented with ursolic acid at a concentration of 50\u00a0mg/kg. The results indicated that BUS caused the loss of spermatogenic cells in testis, the decrease of sperm in epididymis, the disorder of testicular cytoskeleton, the decrease of serum sex hormones such as testosterone which induced an increase in feedback of androgen receptor and other testosterone-related proteins, the increase of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels and the increase of ferroptosis in testis while UNA successfully reversed these injuries. High-throughput sequencing revealed that UNA administration significantly upregulated the expression of genes associated with spermatogenesis, such as Tnp1, Tnp2, Prm1, among others. These proteins are crucial in the histone to protamine transition during sperm chromatin remodeling. Network pharmacology analysis reveals a close association between UNA and proteins related to the transformation of histones to protamine. Molecular docking studies reveal that UNA can interact with the ferroptosis-inhibiting gene SLC7A11, thereby modulating ferroptosis. Taken together, UNA alleviated BUS-induced oligozoospermia by regulating hormone secretion, mitigating oxidative stress and promoting recovery of spermatogenesis by inhibiting the ferroptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
