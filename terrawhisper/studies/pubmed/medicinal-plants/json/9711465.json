The 0.1, 0.25 and 0.45 mg/kg doses impaired the first escape performance suggesting an anxiogenic-like effect of the essential oil. After 3 h the same chicks were tested for a second escape performance, without being injected again, and no differences were observed compared to controls, suggesting that the essential oil did not affect retention. Furthermore, the effects of the essential oil were observed in the three sections of the T-maze apparatus. So, the performance was impaired in the isolation chamber section, suggesting the induction of increased anxiogenic behaviour, and also in the mirror section, suggesting that the social reinstatement behaviour was modified by an increased anxiety level. Changes in the principal corridor section were not observed, suggesting that the locomotor activity was not affected by these oil doses. The second escape performance was not affected in any of the T-maze sections, confirming that these doses did not affect learning ability. In a second experiment, a middle dose of the essential oil (0.25 mg/kg) increased the tonic immobility reaction in 15 days old chicks similarly to an anxiogenic dose of FG 7142 (1 mg/kg), while an anxiolytic dose of diazepam (0.08 mg/kg) did not affect this behaviour. Taken together, the present results suggest that the essential oil from Tagetes minuta L. may exert a negative modulation on the GABAergic function without affecting the learning ability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "C\u00e1tedra de Qu\u00edmica Biol\u00f3gica, ICTA, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, F\u00edsicas y Naturales, Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Marin", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garcia", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martijena", "ForeName": "I D", "Initials": "ID"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zygadlo", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arce", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Perillo", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Fundam Clin Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "8710411", "ISSNLinking": "0767-3981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, GABA-A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "620X0222FQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Flunitrazepam"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flunitrazepam"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Movement"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, GABA-A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9711465", "10.1111/j.1472-8206.1998.tb00967.x", "S0767398198802995"]}}]}
