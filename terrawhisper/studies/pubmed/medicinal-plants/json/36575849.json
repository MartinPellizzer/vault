This study aimed to screen the antimicrobial potential of 8 plants from Cameroon against multi-resistant uropathogenic (MRU) bacteria and to investigate their antibioresistance reversal properties.", "Bioactive compounds were extracted from leaves of <i>Leucanthemum vulgare</i>, <i>Cymbopogon citratus</i>, <i>Moringa oleifera</i> and <i>Vernonia amygdalina</i>; barks of <i>Cinchona officinalis</i> and <i>Enantia chlorantha</i> barks and seeds of <i>Garcinia lucida</i> and leaves and seeds of <i>Azadirachta indica</i> using water and ethanol as solvents. The extracts were tested against <i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 25922, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 6538 and <i>Candida albicans</i> 10231 using the well diffusion and the broth microdilution methods. The antibiotic-resistance reversal activity was assessed against selected MRU bacteria. The phytochemical composition and the elemental composition of the most active extracts were assessed respectively using HPLC-MS/MS and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry.", "Among the most active plants, in decreasing order of antimicrobial activity we found ethanolic (EE) and aqueous extracts (AE) of <i>E. chloranta</i> bark (ECB), EE of <i>L. vulgare</i> leaves and <i>G. lucida</i> seeds. The best synergies between common antibiotics and extracts were found with EE-ECB which well-modulated kanamycin nitrofurantoin and ampicillin. All the compounds identified in EE-ECB were alkaloids and the major constituents were palmatine (51.63%), columbamine+7,8-dihydro-8-hydroxypalmatine (19.21%), jatrorrhizine (11.02%) and pseudocolumbamine (6.33%). Among the minerals found in EE-ECB (S, Si, Cl, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn and Br), Br, Fe and Cl were the most abundant with mean fluorescence intensities of 4.6529, 3.4854 and 2.5942 cps/uA respectively.", "The ethanol extract of the bark of <i>E. chlorantha</i> has remarkable, broad-spectrum antimicrobial and contains several palmatine derivatives."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
