As expected, adria-mycin administration resulted in a significant increase in MDA generation (by 105.4%) and a decrease in GPX activity (by 23.8%) in the red blood cells. Although garlic had no significant effects on the basal levels of the antioxidant enzymes or MDA generation in red blood cells of normal mice (untreated with adriamycin), at doses of 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg, garlic was able to decrease significantly the adriamycin induced changes in the oxido-reductive status of the red blood cells. Thus, on administration of adriamycin to mice fed diets containing 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg garlic, the drug-induced increase in MDA generation was 38.2% and 22.5% respectively, less than that produced by adriamycin in mice fed normal diets, containing no garlic (105.4%). Similarly, in mice fed diets providing 20 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg garlic, adriamycin was able to decrease GPX activity by only 15.1% and 7.6% respectively, less than that produced by adriamycin in rats fed normal diets, containing no garlic (23.9%)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Talagolla Road, Ragama, Sri-Lanka."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thabrew", "ForeName": "M I", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Samarawickrema", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chandrasena", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jayasekera", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "4Y8F71G49Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Malondialdehyde"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "8", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10815020", "10.1002/(sici)1099-1573(200005)14:3<215::aid-ptr626>3.0.co;2-i", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1573(200005)14:3<215::AID-PTR626>3.0.CO;2-I"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
