Quantitative analysis was done by estimation of the primary and secondary metabolites (total proteins, total carbohydrates, total lipids, total glycosaponins, total alkaloids, total flavonoids, and total polyphenolics) in powder and extracts. The maximum value of total proteins (0.59%), total carbohydrates (53.7%), total lipids (27.12%), total glycosaponins (63.9%), total alkaloids (20.3%), total flavonoids (0.23%) and total polyphenolics (0.919%) were respectively. Antimicrobial assay was done by agar well diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration. Haemolytic and DNA protection activity was studied by reported method. Different extracts showed various results however butanol, ethyl acetate, chloroform and methanol give promising results. The results of this present study gives an evidence for the existence of diverse primary and secondary metabolites and thus rationalizes its use in traditional medicines for the cure of different aliments owing to the safety profile on human red blood cells. The conclusions of this research work give an indication that this plant has good potential for antimicrobial activity and has possible pronounced significance as therapeutic agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Numera", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ishtiaq", "ForeName": "Saiqa", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saussurea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31303596"]}}]}
