Long-term use of prescription medications to treat hyperthyroidism has substantial adverse effects and when discontinued, the symptoms frequently recur. Several plant species have been utilized to cure hyperthyroidism. In the present work, we investigated the impact of polyherbal extract (POH) of four medicinal plants to treat hyperthyroidism. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of a high concentration of phytochemicals in the POHs. The in vitro antioxidant study revealed their antioxidant and free radical scavenging capacity. The gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry analysis of the POHs showed the presence of 13 bioactive phytochemical compounds. The effect of various concentrations of POHs on L-thyroxine-induced hyperthyroidism in Wistar albino rats was evaluated for 18\u00a0days. The TSH, T3 and T4 levels increased significantly and reduced the increase of liver enzymes caused by hyperthyroidism in POH-treated rats. The data showed that POH therapy could restore thyroid function to normal. The injection of POH increased the size comprising vacuolated cells, columnar follicular cells and highly coloured nuclei with increasing POH content and the number of normal thyroid follicles rose. The findings indicate that polyherbal formulations of these medicinal plants include credible antithyroid compounds that may offer a protective and an effective alternative treatment to synthetic thyroid medications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
