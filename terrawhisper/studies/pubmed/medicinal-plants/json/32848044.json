They can increase life span in worms and flies, and have various effects related to nervous system function in different animal species and humans. However, which of the compounds in <i>R. rosea</i> is mediating any one of these effects has remained unknown in most cases. Here, an analysis of the volatile and non-volatile low-molecular-weight constituents of <i>R. rosea</i> root samples was accompanied by an investigation of their behavioral impact on <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae. <i>Rhodiola rosea</i> root samples have an attractive smell and taste to the larvae, and exert a rewarding effect. This rewarding effect was also observed for <i>R. rosea</i> root extracts, and did not require activity of dopamine neurons that mediate known rewards such as sugar. Based on the chemical profiles of <i>R. rosea</i> root extracts and resultant fractions, a bioactivity-correlation analysis (AcorA) was performed to identify candidate rewarding compounds. This suggested positive correlations for - among related compounds - ferulic acid eicosyl ester (FAE-20) and \u03b2-sitosterol glucoside. A validation using these as pure compounds confirmed that the correlations were causal. Their rewarding effects can be observed even at low micromolar concentrations and thus at remarkably lower doses than for any known taste reward in the larva. We discuss whether similar rewarding effects, should they be observed in humans, would indicate a habit-forming or addictive potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020.
