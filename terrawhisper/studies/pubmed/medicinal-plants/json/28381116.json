The diets were ISO-caloric and ISO-nitrogenous ones and contained 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 g/kg of peppermint powder. At start, growing, and end periods, the effects of peppermint powder on average daily weight gain, feed conversation ratio, and mortality rate were studied. The results of the present study showed that over a production period of 42 days peppermint had a significant effect on average daily weight gain and feed conversation ratio when compared with the control group ( P < .05). The level of 4.5 g/kg had the highest average daily weight gain (52.78 g), and control treatment with 46.98 g had the least average daily weight gain among different levels of peppermint. The level of 4.5 g/kg and 6 g/kg of peppermint had the least mortality compared to control treatment during training period ( P < .05). From this experiment, we can conclude that treatment with 4.5 g/kg peppermint powder has better performance and carcass characteristics in broilers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Razi Herbal Medicines Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Animal Science Research Institute, Karaj, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asadi", "ForeName": "Nematollah", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Markazi Province Branch, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Husseini", "ForeName": "Seyed Davood", "Initials": "SD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Animal Science Research Institute, Karaj, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tohidian", "ForeName": "Mohammad-Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Razi Herbal Medicines Research Center, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences, Khorramabad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdali", "ForeName": "Nargess", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mimandipoure", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "5 Medical Plants Research Center, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "6 Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahmani", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Evid Based Integr Med. 2018 Oct 16;23:2515690X18809744. doi: 10.1177/2515690X18809744", "PMID": "31329811"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mentha piperita"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Amanpour R, Abbasi-Maleki S, Neyriz-Naghadehi M, Asadi-Samani M.
