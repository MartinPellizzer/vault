Recently developed standardized extract of Centella asiatica ECa 233 has demonstrated positive effects on wound healing of incision and burn wound in rats. However, knowledge associated with wound healing mechanism of ECa 233 was scare. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying molecular mechanisms of ECa 233 on the migration of a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) using scratch wound healing assay. Formation of filopodia, a key protein in cell migration as well as signaling pathways possibly involved were subsequently assessed. It was found that HaCaT cell migration was significantly enhanced by ECa 233 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The filopodia formations were accordingly increased in exposure to ECa 233 at concentrations of 0.1-100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Furthermore, ECa 233 was found to significantly upregulate the expression of Rac1 and RhoA and to induce phosphorylation of FAK and Akt as well as ERK and p38 MAPK. Taken all together, it is suggestive that ECa 233 induces cell migration and subsequently promotes wound healing activity, through the activation of FAK, Akt, and MAPK signaling pathways thereby supporting the role of ECa 233 to be further developed for the clinical treatment of wound."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90110, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Singkhorn", "ForeName": "Sawana", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Burapha University, Chon Buri Campus, Chon Buri, 20131, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Tantisira", "ForeName": "Mayuree H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90110, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Tanasawet", "ForeName": "Supita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90110, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Hutamekalin", "ForeName": "Pilaiwanwadee", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90110, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wongtawatchai", "ForeName": "Tulaporn", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0836-1487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, 90110, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Sukketsiri", "ForeName": "Wanida", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ECa 233 extract"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29532532", "10.1002/ptr.6075"]}}]}
