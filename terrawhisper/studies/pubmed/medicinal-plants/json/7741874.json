Tread mill test (TMT) and echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction was evaluated in some cases. There was 50% reduction in anginal episodes in Group A cases (P < 0.01). TMT performance improved from moderate to mild changes in 5 patients and one with mild changes became negative for ischemia. The time to the onset of angina and appearance of ST-T changes on TMT after T. arjuna was delayed significantly. However, in patients with unstable angina there was an insignificant reduction in anginal frequency. These patients also needed diltiazem, B-blockers and nitroglycerine in addition to T. arjuna. The drug lowered systolic blood pressure and body mass index to a significant level (p < 0.05) and increased HDL-cholesterol only slightly along with marginal improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in stable angina patients. There were no deleterious effects on liver or kidney functions. Our results suggest that monotherapy with T. arjuna is fairly effective in patients with symptoms of stable angina pectoris. However, it has a limited role in unstable angina."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, UCMS, Delhi."}], "LastName": "Dwivedi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Agarwal", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Assoc Physicians India", "NlmUniqueID": "7505585", "ISSNLinking": "0004-5772"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Assoc Physicians India. 1994 Apr;42(4):281-2.", "PMID": "7860542"}, {"RefSource": "J Assoc Physicians India. 1994 Sep;42(9):756.", "PMID": "7883690"}, {"RefSource": "J Assoc Physicians India. 1994 Sep;42(9):757.", "PMID": "7883693"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Angina Pectoris"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Angina, Unstable"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Coronary Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Exercise Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7741874"]}}]}
