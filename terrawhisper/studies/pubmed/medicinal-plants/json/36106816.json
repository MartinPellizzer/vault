It is administered as a sedative, tonic and digestive, also as a treatment for canities and alopecia. Herein, we reported a review on traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology reported from 1985 up to early 2022. All the information and studies concerning Reynoutria plants were summarized from the library and digital databases (e.g. ScienceDirect, SciFinder, Medline PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI).", "A total of 185 articles on the genus Reynoutria have been collected. The phytochemical investigations of Reynoutria species revealed the presence of more than 277 chemical components, including stilbenoids, quinones, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, phospholipids, lactones, phenolics and phenolic acids. Moreover, the compounds isolated from the genus Reynoutria possess a wide spectrum of pharmacology such as anti-atherosclerosis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, anticancer, neuroprotective, anti-virus and heart protection.", "In this paper, the traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of genus Reynoutria were reviewed. As a source of traditional folk medicine, the Reynoutria genus have high medicinal value and they are widely used in medicine. Therefore, we hope our review can help genus Reynoutria get better development and utilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.
