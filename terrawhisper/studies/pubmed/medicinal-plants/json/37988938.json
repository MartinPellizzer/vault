Black crusts formed on historical monuments are considered as factor for deterioration of structures or as an indicator of environmental status of the surrounding area. Black crust formed on historical monuments has never been investigated as a health hazard. Herein, for the first time, we performed in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies of black crust formed on three culturally-rich historical monuments (Rang Ghar, Kareng Ghar, and Talatal Ghar) of the Indian subcontinent to test their toxicological effect. Black crust suspension in ultrapure water was found not to be considerably toxic to the cells upon direct short-term exposure. However, the sub-acute nasal exposure of the black crust suspension in Swiss albino mice produced lung-specific pathologies and mortality. Additionally, structural formation of the black crust along with the speciation of potentially hazardous elements (PHEs), polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), and other metals were investigated. Overall, these results indicate the potential of black crust deposited on historical monuments as health hazard owing to the atmospheric pollution of the surroundings. However, it may be noted that black crust and its components have very low possibility of health implication unless they are disturbed without proper care."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
