However, several cases of liver injury associated with ZOL have been reported and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.The present study aimed to investigate the metabolic activation of ZOL <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. ZOL-derived glutathione (GSH) and <i>N</i>-acetyl cysteine (NAC) conjugates were detected in rat liver microsomal incubations. In addition, the GSH and NAC conjugates were also found in bile and urine of rats given ZOL, respectively.ZOL-derived GSH conjugate M1 was also observed in ZOL-treated rat primary hepatocytes, and the formation of M1 was inhibited by pre-cultured with quinidine (a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6). Combining with recombinant P450 enzymes incubations, we found that CYP2D6 was the predominant enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of ZOL.ZOL can be metabolized to an <i>\u03b1</i>,<i>\u03b2</i>-unsaturated imine intermediate by CYP2D6. Pre-treatment of primary hepatocytes with quinidine was able to reverse ZOL-induced cytotoxicity. The finding facilitates the understanding of the mechanisms involved in ZOL-associated liver adverse reactions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, P.
