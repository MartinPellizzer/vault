The influence of mobile phone exposure on male fertility has been studied in recent years. Other research has shown that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) increase macrophages in the corpus luteum and growing follicles. Due to conflicting results among studies and since no systematic review has been performed to analyze the effects of radiofrequency EMF exposure from electronic devices on the fertility system in recent years, this evidence-based study is necessary.", "The main objectives of this study are to determine the best evidence associated with the influence of radiofrequency EMFs on the fertility system and to provide insight into a potential mechanism using our observations.", "In this systematic review,\u00a0the databases and gray literature will be searched with no language and date limitation. The following databases will be searched: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and other Persian databases. The combination of the Medical Subject Heading terms \"radiofrequency electromagnetic\" and \"male reproductive system\" or \"female reproductive system\" will be searched. Observational study designs will be included but case reports, case series, reviews, and letters to the editor will be excluded. Papers selected for retrieval will be evaluated by two independent referees for methodological validation before entering a review using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies and cohort studies.", "The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication and also presented at PROSPERO.", "This systematic review will provide evidence-based data on the effect of radiofrequency EMFs on the fertility system. This article will also classify the harmful effect of radiofrequency waves on primary and secondary infertility. This study could be useful for decreasing infertility. This is important because the rate of infertility is growing, leading to negative outcomes for couples and the health care system.", "PROSPERO CRD42017072462; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=72462 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6wjiE9R2q)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9Nasibeh Roozbeh, Fatemeh Abdi, Azadeh Amraee, Zahra Atarodi Kashani, Leili Darvish.
