The interactions between the nanocarriers and mucin are crucial for penetration across the mucus layer on the respiratory tract. In this study, we proposed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation method for the screening of polysaccharides that acted as the surface modification materials for inhalable nano-preparations to facilitate mucus penetration. MD revealed all-atom interactions between the monomers of polysaccharides, including dextran (DEX)/hyaluronic acid (HA)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and the human mucin protein MUC5AC (hMUC5AC). The obtained data showed that DEX formed stronger non-covalent bonds with hMUC5AC compared to HA and CMCS, which suggested that HA and CMCS had better mucus permeability than DEX. For the in vitro verification, HA/CMCS-coated liposomes and DEX/PEG-inserted liposomes were prepared. The results of mucin interactions and mucus penetration studies confirmed that HA and CMCS possessed the weakest interactions with mucin and facilitated the mucus penetration, which was in consistent with the data from MD simulation. This work may shed light on the MD simulation-based screening of surface modification materials for inhalable nano-preparations to facilitate mucus penetration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
