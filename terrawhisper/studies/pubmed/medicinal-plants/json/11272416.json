Gene transfer was achieved by inoculation of cotyledonary node explants with a bacterial suspension and a further cocultivation with Agrobacterium suspension for 3 days on B5 basal medium. Only 10% of the explants were transformed with EHA101 and exhibited transient expression of GUS genes, while 2% of shoots exhibited stable integration of genes and developed into plants. Transgenic character of tissues was confirmed by GUS assay and Southern analysis. Histological analysis of GUS gene expression directly after cocultivation revealed a high competence of subepidermal cell layers of cotyledonary node and associated cotyledons for transformation with Agrobacterium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Entomology Research Institute, Loyola College, Chennai 600 034, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ignacimuthu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11272416"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
