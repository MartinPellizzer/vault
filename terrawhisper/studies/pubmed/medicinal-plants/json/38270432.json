To find possible inhibitors of the RNA binding activity of the Marburg virus VP35 protein, we used a thorough in silico drug discovery approach in this investigation. A comprehensive virtual screening process, followed by a detailed MMGBSA analysis, led to the discovery of four potential inhibitory compounds viz. Kudzuisoflavone A, Miquelianin, Rutin, and Protopseudohypericin. They were identified from an extensive library of phytomolecules derived from three medicinal plants: <i>Adiantum capillus-veneris</i>, <i>Hypericum perforatum</i>, and <i>Pueraria montana</i>. In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, all these compounds showed steady binding to the target protein and favourable interactions. Notably, the free binding energies of all the selected compounds were better than the myricetin, a well-known blocker of the VP35 protein of the Ebola virus. Overall, this investigation offers insightful information about the molecular interactions and binding dynamics of the identified inhibitors' binding to the VP35 protein of the Marburg virus. The findings highlight the potential of three particular medicinal plants as sources of key chemicals for the creation of brand-new Marburg virus antiviral drugs. More experimental validation and optimization of the identified inhibitors are necessary in order to transform these findings into effective medicines for treating Marburg virus infections.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
