Currently, different treatment methods are available like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery or their combination. These treatment strategies are not enough and are often associated with adverse side effects. The alternate treatment option like phytochemicals have come up with ease of bioavailability and cost-effectiveness. Due to general acceptance, lower side effects, safety and pleiotropic effect, phytochemicals can be used as an adjuvant treatment for alleviating side effects associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Phytochemicals perform multiple functions; release cytochrome-c, loss mitochondrial membrane potential, down-regulate expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, up-regulate pro-apoptotic proteins, activate caspases, p53, inhibit Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, phosphorylate NF-\u03baB, STAT3 and PI3K. The knowledge compiled here encompasses anti-EC phytochemicals, their occurrence, bioavailability therapeutic effects and mechanism of action by targeting several genes and signaling pathways. Overall, the clinical data compiled on phytochemicals against EC is not sufficient and need future research to provide additional insights for developing potential anticancer drugs in pharma industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.
