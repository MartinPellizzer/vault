In the present study, a screening method, using high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS) combined with a screening strategy, has been established. The technology was used to systematically screening the targeted metabolites, primarily from the complex matrix of S. grosvenorii. The compounds were then identified by their exact masses and characteristic fragment ions, in comparison with the fragmentation behaviors of 19 references. Finally, 122 compounds, including 53 flavonols and flavonol glycosides, 59 triterpene glycosides and 10 siraitic acid glycosides, were screened and identified in 10-, 50- and 80-day fruits, roots, stems and leaves of S. grosvenorii. 98 of them were reported for the first time. Additionally, the distribution of all identified components in different parts of the plant was determined and metabolic networks for flavonol and triterpene glycosides were proposed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017.
