Chemical profiling of the extract revealed the presence of 63 different compounds: phenolic acids, flavonoid glycosides and aglycones, isoflavonoid glycosides and aglycones, and other related compounds. Our results revealed that the extract was active against 8 strains of free floating bacteria. It showed anti-biofilm potential against Staphylococcus aureus and was able to supress the production of staphyloxanthin in S. aureus at sub-minimal inhibitory concentrations. Its antioxidant activity was evaluated by using several assays (phosphomolybdenum, DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, FRAP, and metal chelating assay), which showed that the extract exhibited a dose dependent activity. Inhibition of AChE, BChE, amylase, glucosidase and tyrosinase was achieved by the extract, demonstrating its anti-enzymatic activity. The antiproliferative potential of the extract towards human cancer cell lines (HepG2, MCF-7, SiHa and A172) was determined by using the crystal violet assay. Ki67, a marker of proliferation was downregulated in the A172 glioblastoma cell line."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Physiology, Institute for Biological Research \"Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107\"- National Institute of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade, Bulevar despota Stefana 142, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia. mris@ibiss.bg.ac.rs."}], "LastName": "Stojkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Dejan", "Initials": "D", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Drakuli\u0107", "ForeName": "Danijela", "Initials": "D", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ga\u0161i\u0107", "ForeName": "Uro\u0161", "Initials": "U", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zengin", "ForeName": "Gokhan", "Initials": "G", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stevanovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Milena", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Raj\u010devi\u0107", "ForeName": "Nemanja", "Initials": "N", "Suffix": ""}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sokovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Marina", "Initials": "M", "Suffix": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ononis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32749435", "10.1039/d0fo01595d"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
