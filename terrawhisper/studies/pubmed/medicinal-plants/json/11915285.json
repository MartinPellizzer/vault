MAFF clone 1 being capable of forming somatic embryos was selected and its growth and isoquinoline alkaloid production was investigated. The illumination, temperature and nutrient medium composition greatly affected growth, cell morphology and alkaloid accumulation. The MAFF clone 1 cultured in Root Culture medium in the dark at 22 degrees C accumulated a high quantity of sanguinarine (652 micrograms/g dry weight) though the growth was poor (4.4 fold as fresh weight basis after 2 months of culture). The MAFF clone 1 cultured in a quarter macro salt strength Woody Plant medium under 14 h/day light at 22 degrees C developed into plantlets and accumulated significant quantity of codeine (648 micrograms/g dry wt) together with papaverine, noscapine, and sanguinarine. This clone was applied to a rotating drum fermenter (2 L working volume), and ca. 0.3 mg codeine and 0.06 mg sanguinarine were obtained after 4 weeks of culture. One quarter of the codeine produced was found in the culture medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tsukuba Medicinal Plant Research Station, National Institute of Health Sciences, Ibaraki, Japan. yoshimat@nihs.go.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoshimatsu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shimomura", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Kokuritsu Iyakuhin Shokuhin Eisei Kenkyusho Hokoku", "NlmUniqueID": "9807834", "ISSNLinking": "1343-4292"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Papaver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11915285"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
