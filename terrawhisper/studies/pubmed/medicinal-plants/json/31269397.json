To overcome this challenge, we developed an antimicrobial agent (AgNPs@PDPE) via the conjugation of a pH-responsive copolymer of PDMAEMA-<i>b</i>-PPEGMA onto AgNPs surface. The AgNPs@PDPE underwent an acidity-induced surface charge conversion that favored bacteria-specific aggregation and antibacterial activity improvement. The specific interaction between AgNPs@PDPE and bacteria under acidic conditions was confirmed via an electrochemical method using AgNPs@PDPE modified glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode. AgNPs@PDPE could efficiently aggregate and inhibit the growth of both <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) under acidic condition. The AgNPs@PDPE could also selectively distinguish pathogenic bacteria from host cells, and this characteristic is benefical for reducing the damage to surrounding tissues in the host. Moreover, AgNPs@PDPE could promote the healing of <i>E. coli</i>- and <i>S. aureus</i>-induced infection, as proven by the histological and TNF-\u03b1 immunohistochemical analyses of rat dermal wounds. The proposed antimicrobial agent could to be an alternative treatment strategy for the safe treatment of treat bacteria-induced infections in clinics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
