Thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide induced production of both t-PA and PAI-1 and the elevation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Baicalein isolated from Scutellariae Radix dose-dependently inhibited PAI-1 production induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide; its concentrations for 50% inhibition (IC50) were 6.8 and 3.5 microM, respectively. Other flavonoids had no effect. In contrast, flavonoids isolated from Scutellariae Radix had no effect on production of t-PA induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide. Baicalein inhibited the elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide and, at a concentration of 1000 microM, slightly increased t-PA production. These findings suggest that the mechanism by which baicalein inhibits PAI-1 production induced by thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide might be by reduction of [Ca2+]i elevation. The results suggest that baicalein in Scutellariae Radix might be active as a drug in the treatment of arteriosclerosis and thrombosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2nd Department of Medical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yokoi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Matsushita", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okuda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Thrombin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "137339-65-2", "NameOfSubstance": "thrombin receptor peptide (42-55)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Thrombin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.68", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1"}, {"QualifierName": ["agonists"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Thrombin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombin"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Umbilical Veins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9379363", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06119.x"]}}]}
