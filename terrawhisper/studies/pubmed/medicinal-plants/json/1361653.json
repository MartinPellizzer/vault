Of the 83 patients with acute type A aortic dissection, 47 received surgery during acute stage, 10 received it in the chronic stage, and 26 received nonsurgical therapy. Of the 77 patients with acute type B aortic dissection, 27 received surgery during acute stage, 22 received it in the chronic stage, and 28 received nonsurgical therapy. Ten-year survival rates for patients receiving surgery during the acute stage were 62% for type A and 64% for type B dissection. This survival rate for type A patients was significantly higher than that for type A patients not receiving surgery, but the corresponding difference for type B patients was not significant. Present data indicate that immediate surgical intervention is indicated in patients with acute type A dissection, and elective operation in the subacute stage in patient with uncomplicated type B dissection following medical therapy in the acute stage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery (Section 2), Sapporo Medical College and Hospital, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kazui", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Komatsu", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0405405", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4894"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Aortic Dissection"}, {"QualifierName": ["surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Aortic Aneurysm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Vessel Prosthesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Survival Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1361653"]}}]}
