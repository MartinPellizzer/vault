Meliaceae represent a large family of trees and shrubs, which are widely used in African traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments including fever due to malaria. The in vitro and in vivo antiplasmodial as well as insecticidal investigations of their extracts or isolated compounds have led to promising results but to the best of our knowledge, no specific review on the traditional uses, phytochemistry of the antiplasmodial, insecticidal and cytotoxic lead compounds and extracts of Meliaceae plants has been compiled.", "To review the literature up to 2021 on the Meliaceae family with antiplasmodial, insecticidal and cytotoxic activity.", "A number of online libraries including PubMed, Scifinder, Google Scholar and Web of Science were used in searching for information on antiplasmodial metabolites from Meliaceous plants. The keywords Meliaceae, malaria, Plasmodium, Anopheles and antiplasmodial were used to monitor and refine our search without language restriction.", "The phytochemical investigations of genera of the family Meliaceae led to the isolation and characterization of a wide range of structural diversity of compounds, 124 of which have been evaluated for their antiplasmodial potency against 11 chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum strains. A total of 45 compounds were reported with promising insecticidal potentials against two efficient vector species, Anopheles stephensi Liston and A. gambiae Giles. Limonoids were the most abundant (51.6%) reported compounds and they exhibited the most promising antiplasmodial activity such as gedunin (3) which demonstrated an activity equal to quinine or azadirachtin (1) displaying promising larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal effects on different larval instars of A. stephensi with almost 100% larval mortality at 1\u00a0ppm concentration.", "Studies performed so far on Meliaceae plants have reported compounds with significant antiplasmodial and insecticidal activity, lending support to the use of species of this family in folk medicine, for the treatment of malaria. Moreover, results qualified several of these species as important sources of compounds for the development of eco-friendly pesticides to control mosquito vectors. However, more in vitro, in vivo and full ADMET studies are still required to provide additional data that could guide in developing novel drugs and insecticides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
