This mode was used to separate five major opium alkaloids: morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, and noscapine. Central composite design based on response surface methodology was applied for experimental design, modeling, and optimization in a single-step gradient method. The main effects and their interactions (initial percentage of modifier, changing range of modifier in run time, pH of buffer, and its concentration) were investigated in 30 experiments. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares, by resolving overlapped curves, helped in the accurate calculation of baseline resolution factors to be modeled and optimized more accurately. Then three crucial resolution factors besides elution time were modeled in quadratic and cubic equations and optimized. In addition to the four factors, five extra logarithmic, and nonlogarithmic factors extracted from the four factors to give nine factors overall were inspected on mechanism of retention. It was shown that a linear combination consist of four independence variables successfully describes morphinans retentivity in a single-step gradient method."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
