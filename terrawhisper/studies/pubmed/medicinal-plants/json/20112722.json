With the reference to propranolol, the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of daidzein was measured through the monolayer under the different concentrations and pH media. The metabolites were also measured by enzyme hydrolysis.", "Daidzein had no damage to the growth of the Caco-2 cells in the concentration of 1-50 microg/mL. The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of daidzein across the monolayer showed concentration- and pH- independent manner, which was similar to that of transcellcular marker-propranolol, suggesting the good absorption of daidzein in vivo. By hydrolysis with beta-glucuronidase, low metabolites were detected in monolayer and transport medium, verifying the existence of glucuronides and sulfates.", "The daidzein absorption in Caco-2 cell model is a passive and transcellular transport and quite good in the intestines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Life Sciences, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan 430074, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Yue-Bin", "Initials": "YB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Wei-Zhong", "Initials": "WZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoflavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6287WC5J2L", "NameOfSubstance": "daidzein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caco-2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Isoflavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phytoestrogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20112722"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
