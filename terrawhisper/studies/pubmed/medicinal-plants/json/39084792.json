Wats), lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) and vetiver (Chrysopogon zizaniodes (L.) Nash.). So that these isolates alone or in combination with the vegetation of aromatic grasses will be used to clean up CP-contaminated soils. The study also explored enzymatic activities, CO<sub>2</sub> release, dechlorination potential, and degradation pathways of bacterial strains. A total of 53 CP-tolerant bacteria were isolated on their physical characteristics and their ability to degrade CP. The ten highly CP-tolerant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pa608, three strains of Pseudomonas hibiscicola R4-721 from different rhizosphere, Enterococcus lectis PP2a, Pseudomonas monteilii NBFPALD_RAS131, Enterobacter cloacae L3, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PEG-390, Escherichia coli ABRL132, and Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain FWSEC0009. The CO<sub>2</sub> emission and phosphatase activities of the isolates varied from 3.1 to 8.6\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup> and 12.3 to 31\u00a0\u03bcmol PNP h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively in the CP medium. The degradation kinetics of CP by these isolates followed a one-phase decay model with a dissipation rate ranging from 0.048 to 0.41 d<sup>-1</sup> and a half-life of 1.7-14.3\u00a0days. The growth data fitted in the SGompertz equation showed a growth rate (K) of 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 to 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33 d<sup>-1</sup>. The P. monteilii strain had a faster growth rate while E. coli ABRL132 had slower growth among the isolates. The rate of TCP accumulation calculated by the SGompertz equation was 0.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 to 1.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 d<sup>-1</sup>. The Pseudomonas monteilii showed a lower accumulation rate of TCP. Among these, four highly effective isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pa608, Pseudomonas monteilii NBFPALD_RAS131, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PEG-390, and Pseudomonas hibiscicola R4-721. Illustrations of the degradation pathways indicated that the difference in metabolic pathways of each isolate was associated with their growth rate, phosphatase, dehydrogenase, oxidase, and dechlorination activities."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
