The current study was designed to synthesize and characterize a new graphene titanate nanocomposite (GTNc) and explore its anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potencies against Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in rats, as well as investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our characterization methods included XRD, FT-IR, SEM, EDX, zeta potential, practical size, and XRF to characterize the novel GTNc. Our findings revealed that arthritic rats treated with GTNc exhibited lower levels of RF, CRP, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17, and ADAMTS-5, and higher levels of IL-4 and TIMP-3. In arthritic rats, GTNc reduced LPO levels while increasing GSH content and GST antioxidant activity. Additionally, GTNc decreased the expression of the TGF-\u03b2 mRNA gene in arthritic rats. Histopathological investigation showed that GTNc reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage degradation, and bone destruction in joint injuries caused by CFA in the arthritic rats. Collectively, the anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of GTNc appear promising for future arthritis treatments and bone disability research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier":
