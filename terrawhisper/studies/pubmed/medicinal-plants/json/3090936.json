The release of CO2 from glycine in intact mitochondria isolated from dark-grown and nonphotosynthetic tissues was sensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport, glycine transport, and glycine decarboxylase activities. The CO2-release and glycine-bicarbonate exchange activities in crude mitochondrial protein extracts from light-grown versus dark-grown tissues exhibited light/dark ratios of 12 and 21, respectively. This suggests that the differences in capacity to oxidize glycine reside with the glycine decarboxylase enzyme complex itself. The complex is composed of four subunit enzymes, the P, H, T, and L proteins, which can be isolated individually and reconstituted into the active enzyme. The activities of P and T proteins were at least 10 times higher in fully greened pea leaves than in the etiolated tissue, while the H and L protein activities were four times higher in these same tissues. The levels of P and T proteins detected immunochemically were substantially lower in total mitochondrial extracts prepared from leaves of dark-grown pea seedlings. Labeling of whole pea seedlings and in vitro protein synthesis with isolated mitochondria indicated that the entire glycine decarboxylase enzyme complex is cytoplasmically synthesized and therefore encoded by the nucleus. Polypeptides synthesized from total leaf polyadenylated mRNA isolated from leaves of both the dark-grown and light-treated peas indicated the presence of P protein. This implies that translatable messages for this enzyme are present at some level throughout leaf development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oliver", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.4.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.10", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminomethyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TE7660XO1C", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aminomethyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Dehydrogenase (Decarboxylating)"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transferases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3090936", "10.1016/0003-9861(86)90517-5", "0003-9861(86)90517-5"]}}]}
