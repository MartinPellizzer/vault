In the qualitative phase, we interviewed 9 traditional healers and 13 women to understand how the indigenous people use MO for wound healing. In the quantitative phase, a randomized controlled trial was performed on primiparous women during July 23-November 22 in 2016. One hundred and forty-seven women were randomly assigned to intervention (n=73) and control (n=74) groups. At 48h postpartum, 15g of MO was provided to the women to be administered for three days (through smoking the episiotomy wound). Pain and wound healing were measured at 3, 7, and 10 days postpartum using the visual analogue scale and REEDA scale, respectively.", "MO had no significant effect on episiotomy pain intensity at 3, 7, and 10 days postpartum (p=0.61, p=0.76, and p=0.45, respectively). In addition, healing rates of the episiotomy wounds treated by MO (mean: 0.11\u00b10.45, 0.15\u00b10.51, and 0.15\u00b10.57, respectively) were higher than those in the control group (mean: 0.21\u00b10.70, 0.16\u00b10.63, and 0.49\u00b10.28, respectively) at 3, 7, and 10 days postpartum; however, the difference between the two groups was not significant (p=0.27, p=0.76, and p=0.23, respectively).", "In the current study, healing rates in the MO group were higher than those in the control group; however, further studies should be undertaken to identify the effects of MO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
