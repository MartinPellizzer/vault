The significantly increased activities of the two enzymes during diabetes in liver and kidney were found to be lowered to almost control values by the use of the antidiabetic compounds. Diabetic liver exhibited a much greater increase in the activities of the two enzymes than diabetic kidney. The highest percentage of reversal to normal values was seen using the combination of vanadate and Trigonella seed powder. The lowered rate of growth of the animals as well as the increased blood sugar were reversed almost to the control levels by the Trigonella seed powder and vanadate treatment. The inclusion of the Trigonella seed powder overcame the toxicity of vanadium encountered when it was given alone as insulin mimetic agent. Much lower levels of vanadate were needed when it was given in combination with Trigonella seed powder. Their combined effects were better at restoring the above parameters than those induced by insulin administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Raju", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baquer", "ForeName": "N Z", "Initials": "NZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WHH0066W5", "NameOfSubstance": "Vanadates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "68990-15-8", "NameOfSubstance": "fenugreek seed meal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.11", "NameOfSubstance": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fructose-Bisphosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gluconeogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose-6-Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vanadates"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10641146"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
