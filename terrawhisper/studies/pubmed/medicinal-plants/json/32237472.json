However, the genetic basis of Dao-di &quot;Huajiao&quot; is virtually unknown. The transcriptome of the fruit and leaf from Sichuan(Hanyuan, Jiulong, Lixian, Maoxian), Gansu(Wudu) province and Shaanxi(Fengxian) province was sequenced. Trinity de novo assembling resulted in a total of 177 616 unigenes. Through the KEGG, NR, SwissProt, Trembl, KOG/COG, GO, Pfam database comparision 106 644 annotated Unigene finally, 4 574 deferentially expressed genes were found in fruit between Sichuan and other provinces, including 3 740 up-regulated genes and 834 down-regulated genes. Among the up-regulated genes, 27 up-regulated genes were raleted to terpenoids, and 8 up-regulated genes were related to isoquinoline alkaloid bio-synthesis. Furthermore, it was also showed remarkable differences in groups which enrichment ratio of the diffe-rent expressed gene compared. The different expressed genes were annotated by the KEGG database into plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in fruit and leaf, but isoflavonoid bio-synthesis and betaine bio-synthesis were significantly different in fruit and leaf. The study laid a certain reference basis for comparison of quality and different expressed gene of Z. bungeanum from different groups."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo":
