Our findings showed significant differences in heavy metals bioaccumulation, photosynthetic pigments and total phenolic/flavonoids contents among <i>L</i>. <i>dentata</i> leafs ethanolic extracts, grown under different levels of heavy metals stress condition. The <i>L. dentata</i> leafs extracts, grown under Zn and Cu stress condition, showed the highest antioxidant and antimicrobial activities than those grown under Cd and Pb stress condition. Comparatively, the <i>L. dentata</i> leafs extracts, grown under Zn stress condition, showed higher antioxidant activity, and those, grown under Cu stress condition, showed higher antimicrobial activity. The highest cytotoxicity was showed by <i>L. dentata</i> leaf extracts, grown under Cd and Pb stress condition, which lead to conclude that these extracts could be served as a novel scaffold in search for new drugs against cancer. In conclusion, the highlighted variability reflects the high impact of heavy metals stress condition on phytochemical composition and consequently on the biological activities of medicinal plants. Such impact led to conclude that we should select medicinal plants extracts to be investigated carefully depending on this stress condition, in order to isolate the bioactive components or to have the best quality of extracts in terms of biological activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Electrochemistry-Corrosion, Metallurgy and Mineral Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Houari Boumediene University of Sciences and Technology (USTHB), Algiers, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Terfi", "ForeName": "Souhila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Vegetal Ecology and Environment, Department of Ecology and Environment, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Houari Boumediene University of Sciences and Technology (USTHB), Algiers, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Djerrad", "ForeName": "Zineb", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Bioactive Products and Biomass Valorization Research, ENS Kouba, Algiers, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Krimat", "ForeName": "Soumeya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Electrochemistry-Corrosion, Metallurgy and Mineral Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Houari Boumediene University of Sciences and Technology (USTHB), Algiers, Algeria."}], "LastName": "Sadi", "ForeName": "Fatma", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "00BH33GNGH", "NameOfSubstance": "Cadmium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cadmium"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "22"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35892144", "10.1080/01480545.2022.2104868"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
