The vast antimicrobial properties of these plants reside in the inhibitory properties of their endogenous secondary metabolites. Therefore, this study aimed to assess if the volatile oil of Syzygium samarangense inhibits enteric bacteria growth and its effect against the caseinolytic activity of the extracellular protease of Salmonella typhimurium.", "The volatile oil was extracted by hydrodistillation, while the antimicrobial assay was assessed with the microdilution method. The extracellular protease was partially purified by salting out, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. The mode of inhibition of this enzyme was deduced from the enzyme-substrate kinetics using a line-weaver burke plot.", "The antimicrobial properties of the oil were reported against ten enteric bacteria. Proteus vulgaris has the highest IC50 value of 0.75\u00b10.004% v/v, while S. typhimurium, the most sensitive bacterium, showed the lowest IC50 value of 0.17\u00b10.005% v/v. The extracellular protease of S. typhimurium was partially purified to achieve 3.73 purification fold and 314.2 \u03bcmol min-1 mg-1 protein. The optimal caseinolytic activity of this enzyme was found at pH 7.5 and 40 \u00b0C. The protease showed significantly higher activity in the presence of Zn2+ (9.3\u00b10.33 U min-1) as compared to the control (7.0\u00b10.58 U min-1) (p<0.05), however, K+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+ considerably reduced the enzyme activity. The activity of this enzyme was competitively inhibited by the volatile oil as an inhibitor.", "The volatile oil of S. samarangense inhibited a wide range of enteric bacteria and, therefore proposed as a potential antimicrobial agent. Inhibiting the extracellular protease of S. typhimurium may be one of its modes of action against these pathogens."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Folorunso", "ForeName": "O S", "Initials": "OS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adeola", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Giwa Ajeniya", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Hydrolases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella typhimurium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Syzygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32363819", "10.3923/pjbs.2020.628.637"]}}]}
