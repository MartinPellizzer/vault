Formed by the coupling of two coniferyl alcohol residues, lignans constitute major plant \"specialized metabolites\" with exceptional biological attributes that aid in plant defence and provide health benefits in humans by reducing the risk of ailments such as cancer, diabetes etc. Linseed (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i> L.) is one of the richest sources of lignans followed by cereals and legumes. Among the various types of lignans, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is considered as the essential and nutrient rich lignan in linseed. Lignans exhibit established antimitotic, antiviral and anti-tumor properties that contribute to their medicinal value. The present review seeks to provide a holistic view of research in the past and present times revolving around lignans from linseed and its allied species. This review attempts to elucidate sources, structures and functional properties of lignans, along with detailed biosynthetic mechanisms operating in plants. It summarizes various methods for the determination of lignan content in plants. Biotechnological interventions (<i>in planta</i> and in\u00a0vitro) aimed at enriching lignan content and adoption of integrative approaches that might further enhance lignan content and medicinal and nutraceutical value of <i>Linum</i> spp. have also been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, School of Chemical and Life Sciences, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Chhillar", "ForeName": "Himanshu", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, School of Chemical and Life Sciences, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Chopra", "ForeName": "Priyanka", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, School of Chemical and Life Sciences, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Ashfaq", "ForeName": "Mohd Ashraf", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8001-26-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Linseed Oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Edible Grain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lignans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Linseed Oil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32619358", "10.1080/10408398.2020.1784840"]}}]}
