Quercetin, belonging to flavonol subclass of flavonoids, has received considerable attention because of its wide uses as a nutritional supplement as well as a phytochemical remedy for a number of diseases. In the current study, quantification of quercetin was carried out in two medicinally important flavonoid rich plant Ziziphus mucronata and Ziziphus sativa. Emission spectroscopy was utilized as a new method coupled with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and the cross validation was done by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The results indicated the higher quercetin content in Z. mucronata (1.50\u00b10.034%) than Z. sativa (1.21\u00b10.052%), and were further verified through Folin-Ciocalteu Colorimetric method (Z. mucronata; 1.41\u00b10.26% and Z. sativa; 1.13\u00b10.136%). In this study the sensitivity was explained in term of slope i.e. Slope=0.9973."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
