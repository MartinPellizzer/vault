Willoughby spearheaded the pioneering investigation into the evolution of memory decline spanning from the age of 20 to 70. Employing a computerized substitution examination, he pinpointed a zenith in memory prowess at the age of 22, signifying the shift from infancy, succeeded by a gradual decline in later years in 1929. Cognitive impairment impacts various facets, encompassing cognition, memory, perceptual acuity, and linguistic proficiency. Compelling evidence indicates that genetic, dietary, and metabolic factors influence the trajectory of cognitive decline in this patient cohort. In addition to the widely recognized influence of the Mediterranean diet on cognitive function, numerous studies have delved into the potential impact of diverse phytochemicals on cognitive deterioration. Many of these compounds are renowned for their inflammation reducer or free-radical scavenger properties, coupled with their commendable acceptability and defense profiles. Phytochemicals sourced from medicinal plants play an essential role in upholding the intricate chemical equilibrium of the brain by modulating receptors linked to crucial inhibitory neurotransmitters. Across the annals of historical medicinal traditions, a multitude of plants have been cataloged for their efficacy in mitigating cognitive disorders. This study presents a concise examination of distinct medicinal herbs, highlighting their neuroprotective phytochemical components such as fatty acids, phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, terpenes, and beyond. The principal objective of this inquiry is to meticulously inspect and provide discernment into the extant evidence concerning phytochemicals exhibiting clinically demonstrable effects on cognitive decline."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0002-2489-6449"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (Pharmacy Institute), Plot No.19, Knowledge Park-II, Greater Noida, 201306, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "Sanidhya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3053-8106"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (Pharmacy Institute), Plot No.19, Knowledge Park-II, Greater Noida, 201306, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Mazumder", "ForeName": "Avijit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8531-9963"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology (Pharmacy Institute), Plot No.19, Knowledge Park-II, Greater Noida, 201306, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Das", "ForeName": "Saumya", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7003-0489"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology, Plot No.19, Knowledge Park-II, Greater Noida, 201306, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Tyagi", "ForeName": "Pankaj Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9432-2374"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, Punjab, India."}], "LastName": "Chaitanya", "ForeName": "Mvnl", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101269163", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5249"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "59"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "16", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38879771", "10.2174/0118715249315826240603075900", "CNSAMC-EPUB-141076"]}}]}
