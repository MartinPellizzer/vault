However, the effect of arsenic (As) pollution in soil on the translocation of Se species in rice plants is unclear. In this research, a pot experiment was designed to examine the effect of the addition of 50 mg As/kg soil as arsenite or arsenate on the migration of Se species from soil to indica Minghui 63 and Luyoumingzhan. The results showed that the antagonism between inorganic As and Se was closely related to the rice cultivar and Se oxidation state in soil. Relative to the standalone selenate treatment, arsenite significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the accumulation of selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenate in the roots, stems, sheaths, leaves, brans and kernels of both cultivars by 21.4%-100.0%, 40.0%-100.0%, 41.0%-100%, 5.4%-96.3%, 11.3%-100.0% and 26.2%-39.7% respectively, except for selenocystine in the kernels of indica Minghui 63 and selenomethionine in the leaves of indica Minghui 63 and the stems of indica Luyoumingzhan. Arsenate also decreased (p < 0.05) the accumulation of selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenate in the roots, stems, brans and kernels of both cultivars by 34.9%-100.0%, 30.2%-100.0%, 11.3%-100.0% and 5.6%-39.6% respectively, except for selenate in the stems of indica Minghui 63. However, relative to the standalone selenite treatment, arsenite and arsenate decreased (p < 0.05) the accumulation of selenocystine, selenomethionine and selenite only in the roots of indica Minghui 63 by 45.5%-100.0%. Our results suggested that arsenite and arsenate had better antagonism toward Se species in selenate-added soil than that in selenite-added soil; moreover, arsenite had a higher inhibiting effect on the accumulation of Se species than arsenate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
