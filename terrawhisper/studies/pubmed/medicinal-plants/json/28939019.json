In the present study, we investigated anti-inflammatory effects of modified Korean herbal formulation, mixed extract of medicinal herbs (MEMH), and its modulatory effects on inflammatory mediators associated with gouty arthritis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were carried out to assess the anti-inflammatory efficacy of MEMH on monosodium urate (MSU) crystals-induced gouty inflammation. MSU crystals stimulated human chondrosarcoma cell line, SW1353, and human primary chondrocytes were treated with MEMH in vitro. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and metalloproteases were analyzed. The effect of MEMH on NF\u03baB signaling pathway in SW1353 cells was examined. Effect of MEMH on the mRNA expression level of pro-inflammatory mediators and chemotactic factor from human monocytic cell line, THP-1, was also analyzed. The probable role of MEMH in the differentiation process of osteoblast like cells, SaOS-2, after MSU treatment was also observed. To investigate the effects of MEMH in vivo, MSU crystals-induced ankle arthritic model was established. Histopathological changes in affected joints and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1) were recorded. MEMH inhibited NF\u03baB signaling pathway and COX-2 protein expression in chondrocytes. MSU-induced mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators and chemotactic cytokines were suppressed by MEMH. In MSU crystals-induced ankle arthritic mouse model, administration of MEMH relieved inflammatory symptoms and decreased the plasma levels of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. The results indicated that MEMH can effectively inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators in gouty arthritis, demonstrating its potential for treating gouty arthritis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 China Pharmaceutical University.
