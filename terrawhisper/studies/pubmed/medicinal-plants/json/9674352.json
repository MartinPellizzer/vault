The potential for integration of complementary and alternative therapies into traditional patient care and contemporary models of science is a topic of increasing discussion. Women account for two-thirds of appointments with US practitioners of alternative medicine. Reproductive health problems, including menstruation disorders, infertility, menopause, and dysfunctions of pregnancy and delivery, offer opportunities for clinical applications of alternative approaches. Many midwives and nurses are interested in these approaches and have sought out special training. This article reviews three alternative approaches available in the US--herbal medicine, homeopathy, and acupuncture and acupressure--and discusses their potential applications to women's reproductive health care."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["137098", "00281010"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF NURSE-MIDWIFERY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acupuncture", "Americas", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developed Countries", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "North America", "Northern America", "Nurses", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproductive Health--women", "Treatment", "United States"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "9674352", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1998", "Month": "08", "Day": "13"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "24"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0091-2182", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "43", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1998", "Season": "May-Jun"}}, "Title": "Journal of nurse-midwifery", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Nurse Midwifery"}, "ArticleTitle": "Women's use of complementary and alternative therapies in reproductive health care.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "224", "EndPage": "234", "MedlinePgn": "224-34"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Numerous studies have documented that health care consumers all over the world are spending money out of pocket for alternative therapies and that billions of dollars are spent in the United States alone. In this article, the use of complementary and alternative therapies by women health care consumers is discussed, particularly as this phenomenon relates to women's reproductive health in the United States. Women use conventional health care services more frequently than men; thus, it is not surprising that women account for approximately two thirds of health care appointments for complementary and alternative therapies.
