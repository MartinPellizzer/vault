The inhibitory effect on adenosine diphosphate- and collagen-induced human platelet aggregation was evaluated. Prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastine time and thrombine time were measured to examine the anticoagulant activity. The free radical scavenging ability was assessed with DPPH and ABTS assays. The fraction that showed the most active was used to separate and purify compounds. The structures of compounds were elucidated by NMR and MS spectroscopic methods. Isolated compounds were also tested for antiplatelet, anticoagulant and antioxidant activity.", "The ethyl acetate fraction showed the most potent antiplatelet aggregation, anticoagulant and antioxidant activity. Subsequent fractionation of this active fraction resulted in the isolation of seven known compounds: 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (1), epimedokoreanone A (2), nepetoidin B (3), ferulic acid (4), caffeic acid (5), hydroxytyrosol (6), and 1H-indole-3-carboxaldehyde (7). Previous studies reported the antiplatelet, anticoagulant and antioxidant activity of ferulic acid (4), caffeic acid (5) and hydroxytyrosol (6) and the antioxidant activity of nepetoidin B (3). This study demonstrated that both epimedokoreanone A (2) and nepetoidine B (3) also exhibited good antiplatelet effect and epimedokoreanone A (2) also had effective anticoagulant and antioxidant activity, while 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one (1) showed weaker antiplatelet and antioxidant activity but no anticoagulant effect.", "This is the first experimental study to demonstrate the potent dose-dependent antiplatelet aggregation, anticoagulant and antioxidant activity of C. edulis rhizome and its pure compounds, supporting the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of heart diseases. The C. edulis rhizome is a potential source of bioactive compounds or functional food for treatment and/or prevention of heart- and oxidative stress-related diseases and its bioactive compounds are good candidates for drug development of anti-thrombosis and antioxidant agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
