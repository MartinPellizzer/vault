The protectivity of these acids was compared with dexrazoxan, used as an adjuvant during DOX chemotherapy. The cytoprotective effects were assessed by enzyme (LDH and ASAT) and troponin I leakage, secondly by intracellular ATP content. All hydroxycinnamic acids proved non-cytotoxic, and they stabilized both membranes and the energetic status of cardiomyocytes. After preincubation of cardiomyocytes with the test compounds (100, 200 microm; 1 h) the cardiomyocytes were treated with the toxic agent, DOX (100 microm; 8 h). The test compounds protected cardiomyocytes against DOX induced oxidative stress (RA > CHA > or = CA) on all monitored parameters. Substantial preservation of monolayer integrity of the cardiomyocytes by test compounds was also found microscopically. All the acids were more effective in the assays used than dexrazoxan. RA showed the most effective cytoprotectivity. All the acids significantly reduced the iron-dependent DOX induced lipid peroxidation of heart membranes, although of the test compounds, CHA was found to be the most effective (IC(50) = 8.04 +/- 0.74/6.87 +/- 0.52 micro m for microsomes/mitochondria)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hnevot\u00ednsk\u00e1 3, 775 15 Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chlopc\u00edkov\u00e1", "ForeName": "S\u00e1rka", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Psotov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Jitka", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Miketov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Petra", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sousek", "ForeName": "Jarom\u00edr", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lichnovsk\u00fd", "ForeName": "V\u00e1clav", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sim\u00e1nek", "ForeName": "Vil\u00edm", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "318ADP12RI", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorogenic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15174003", "10.1002/ptr.1461"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
