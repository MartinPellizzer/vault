It can objectively describe the law of efficacy of Dao-di herbs, scientifically explain the mechanism of efficacy of Dao-di herbs, explore and establish the standards and methods of Dao-di herbs based on biological effect and clinical efficacy, and provide scientific basis for the special properties, pharmacology and clinical value of Dao-di herbs.Furthermore, we put forward a new idea of building the standard of Dao-di herbs based on the curative effect rather than the origin.The Dao-di herbs standard should come from the systematic research of traditional Dao-di herbs producing areas and form a new characteristic system, through the extraction of environmental, genetic, character, chemical, pharmacological and other characteristics.This standard originates from the tradition, but it is higher than the tradition. It may not have the origin meaning of strict administrative division, but it can better reflect the pharmacological characteristics and excellent clinical value of Dao-di herbs."]}, "AuthorList":
