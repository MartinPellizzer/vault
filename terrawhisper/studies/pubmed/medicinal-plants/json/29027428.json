In the present work, primers used to amplify full-length gene encoding WRKY transcription factor were designed based on the transcriptome data of P. ginseng that induced by benzoic acid, one of the most important autotoxins identified from root exudates and rhizosphere soil of P. ginseng. Then, a WRKY gene, temporarily named as WRKY7, was confirmed by RT-RCR. Furthermore, sequencing and sequence analysis of WRKY7 was conducted. Results indicated that, the full length cDNA of WRKY7 was 1 216 bp, the open reading frame (ORF) of which was 1 014 bp, encodes 337 amino acids. Homologous analysis and phylogenetic tree showed that, WRKY7 belonged to the \u2162 category of WRKY families, which showing 87% similarity to WRKY6 in P. quinquefolius. Real-time PCR results showed that the expression of WRKY7 in P. ginseng induced by benzoic acid was up-regulated markedly than the control, so we speculated that WRKY7 was involved in the response to benzoic acid stress, which will be helpful for further research on the molecular mechanism of ginseng plant response to benzoic acid stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zi", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Wan-Long", "Initials": "WL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8SKN0B0MIM", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzoic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzoic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29027428", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170217.004"]}}]}
