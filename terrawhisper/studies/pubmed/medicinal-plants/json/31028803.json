The study determined the effects of modulating the expression or activity of TAK1 on the SnoN protein level and its influence on the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition.", "Under the high-glucose condition, the activation of TGF-\u03b21/TAK1-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of SnoN protein resulted in reduced SnoN protein level as a consequence of enhanced SnoN degradation, which promoted EMT and ECM deposition in renal tubular epithelial cells. The study showed that TAK1 impaired SnoN protein level by decreasing the protein stability of SnoN.", "TAK1 mediated the phosphorylation of SnoN, resulting in SnoN ubiquitination and eventual degradation, which enhanced EMT and ECM deposition to promote renal fibrosis during DN."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
