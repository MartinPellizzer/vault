Medicinal plants-associated endophytic fungi possess a well-developed secondary metabolism. In this study, chemical investigation on <i>Penicillium ochrochloron</i> YT2022-65, an endophytic fungus associated with <i>Lonicera Japonica</i>, led to the isolation of six structurally diversified indole alkaloids, including a new one, namely peniochroloid A (<b>1</b>), as well as five previously reported alkaloids, flavonoid B (<b>2</b>), brocaeloid C (<b>3</b>), isoroquefortine C (<b>4</b>), roquefortine C (<b>5</b>), and dihydrocarneamide A (<b>6</b>). Their structures, including the absolute configuration of <b>1</b>, were determined by a combined analysis of HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic data, and calculation of the optical rotation. Their cytotoxicity against A549, HepG2, MCF-7, and THP-1 cell lines were evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. The new compound <b>1</b> was found to possess considerable cytotoxicity against MCF-7 and THP-1 cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.2 and 11.0\u2009\u03bcM, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicine & Pharmacy Research Center, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xingjie", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicine & Pharmacy Research Center, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Ruonan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Community Health Service center of Luoyang Road, Qingdao, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Xiaofei", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37867305", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2272778"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
