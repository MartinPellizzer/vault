The clinical usefulness of the doxorubicin has been precluded by its marked cardiotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Khamira Abresham Hakim Arshadwala, a well known unani cardiac tonic formulation, pre-treatment on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity in rats. Twenty-four Wistar albino rats, divided into four groups, were used. Khamira Abresham Hakim Arshadwala was administered daily, for 7 days, and a single dose of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg, i.v.) on day 5. After 48 h of doxorubicin injection, animals were sacrificed. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine were estimated in the serum. Heart specimens were used for biochemical estimations of lipid peroxides (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, and for microscopic examination of histopathological changes. Doxorubicin showed cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, as evidenced by elevated activities of AST, LDH, BUN, creatinine, and MDA, depletion in GSH level, and catalase activity. Histopathological studies showed disruption of cardiac tissues in doxorubicin groups. Khamira Abresham Hakim Arshadwala pre-treatment showed a protective effect against the enzymatic changes in serum as well as cardiac and kidney tissue damage, significantly. The present findings suggest that Khamira Abresham Hakim Arshadwala significantly (p < 0.01) improved the state of markers for cardiac and kidney damage investigated in this model of doxorubicin-induced experimental cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity; indicating its potential in limiting doxorubicin toxicity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jamia Hamdard, Hamdard University, New Delhi 110062, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nazmi", "ForeName": "Abdul Salam", "Initials": "AS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Shibli Jameel", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rashikh", "ForeName": "Azhar", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pillai", "ForeName": "Krishna Kolappa", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Najmi", "ForeName": "Abul Kalam", "Initials": "AK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Mech Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101134521", "ISSNLinking": "1537-6516"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80168379AG", "NameOfSubstance": "Doxorubicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antibiotics, Antineoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Aspartate Aminotransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blood Urea Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Doxorubicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Unani"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "11", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21067281", "10.3109/15376516.2010.529188"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
