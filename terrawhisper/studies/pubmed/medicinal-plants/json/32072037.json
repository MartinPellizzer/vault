However, little is known about the cultural practices of diabetic patients among the Bamar population of Myanmar.", "The aim of this study was to explore the cultural practices of Bamar diabetic patients in Myanmar.", "The conceptual framework of this ethnographic study was based on Spradley's ethnographic theory and Leininger's cultural care theory. Seven participants who met the preset criteria were purposively selected from Anawmar quarter, Tharkayta Township, Yangon. Their cultural practices were studied through participant observations, ethnographic interviews and writing field notes. Collected data were analyzed step-by-step using Creswell's data analysis method.", "The nine main themes that emerged were: reasons for late awareness of diabetes, misconceptions, cultural beliefs and practices, non-adherence, cultural influences on controlling diet, limitations in physical activities, suffering of living with diabetes, emotional reactions and coping by way of religious or spiritual beliefs. Fourty-six subthemes support the main themes.", "It was found that Bamar diabetics in this study were being strongly influenced by cultural beliefs and practices on treatment choice and controlling diet. They believed that diabetes is a curable disease, and its cause is due to cultural factors such as <i>karma</i> from either a previous or their current life. <i>Bamar</i> diabetic patients in this study used a variety of medicinal plants and traditional medicines due to availability at affordable prices.", "Although some cultural beliefs are not harmful, some have detrimental effects on these patients' health. Hopefully, this study may provide information which can reduce cultural influences on <i>Bamar</i> diabetic patients. The results of this study highlight patients' needs for nursing personnel when it comes to providing effective culturally-tailored care."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Fundamental Nursing, University of Nursing, Yangon, Myanmar."}], "LastName": "Wah Oo", "ForeName": "Htet Shwe", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Nursing, Yangon, Myanmar."}], "LastName": "Nau", "ForeName": "Kaw", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Services, Ministry of Health and Sports, Myanmar."}], "LastName": "Kyi", "ForeName": "Khin Mar", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Heliyon", "NlmUniqueID": "101672560", "ISSNLinking": "2405-8440"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Abdulrehman M.S., Woith W., Jenkins S., Kossman S., Hunter G.L.
