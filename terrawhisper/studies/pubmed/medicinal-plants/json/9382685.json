From these seeds, protein concentrates were elaborated by wet processing and two different procedures of drying were followed (freeze-drying and alcohol washing). The composition and content of several antinutritional factors (phytates, tannins, trypsin inhibitors and lectins) were assessed in all of them. Also some functional properties regarding their potential use in food technology were evaluated, such as protein solubility at different pH, as well as water and oil absorption capacities. All the obtained concentrates showed high protein contents, nevertheless protein extraction efficiency was smaller in alcohol-washed concentrates than in the lyophilized ones. In the other hand, the concentrates obtained from pea and faba bean showed higher yields than those obtained from soya. The content of antinutritional factors were markedly reduced after the concentration process. Furthermore, the functional properties of pea and faba bean protein concentrates point out their suitability for food preparation as previously reported for soya."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Area de Nutrici\u00f3n y Bromatolog\u00eda, Facultad de Farmacia, Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco, Espa\u00f1a."}], "LastName": "Cantoral", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Quintela", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Macarulla", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"], "VernacularTitle": "Estudio comparativo de la composici\u00f3n y el valor nutritivo de semillas y concentrados de prote\u00edna de leguminosas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}], "NumberOfReferences": "44"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9382685"]}}]}
