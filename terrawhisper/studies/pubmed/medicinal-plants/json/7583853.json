Because of the phylogenetic relationship between these plant species, cross-allergenicity has been a concern.", "The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible cross-allergenicity of plantain and psyllium.", "Homologous and heterologous crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) were performed using a commercial English plantain pollen extract and an extract of psyllium seed embryo. Crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) was performed using sera from subjects who were RAST positive only to plantain (group A), RAST positive only to psyllium (group B), RAST positive to both plantain and psyllium (group C), or RAST negative to both (group D).", "All of the group A plantain subjects showed IgE binding to at least one of the six plantain allergens in homologous plantain CRIEs while only one of the sera from the group B subjects reacted very weakly to these plantain allergens. In homologous psyllium CRIE, all group B subjects showed pronounced IgE binding to 2 to 7 of the seven psyllium allergens. Several of the plantain subjects demonstrated only very weak binding to psyllium allergens. Heterologous CRIEs demonstrated little relevant IgE binding.", "These results indicate that there is little cross-allergenicity between psyllium husk and English plantain pollen."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio, USA."}], "LastName": "Morgan", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Arlian", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vyszenski-Moher", "ForeName": "D L", "Initials": "DL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Deyo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kawabata", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fernandez-Caldas", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immune Sera"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8063-16-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Psyllium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Immediate"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immune Sera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoelectrophoresis, Two-Dimensional"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Psyllium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7583853"]}}]}
