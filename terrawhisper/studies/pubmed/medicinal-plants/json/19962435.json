This activity was assessed using a standard motility assay against a levamisole resistant strain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.", "Anthelmintic activity was confirmed in 12 plant species. Of these, eight showed strong evidence of activity (p<0.0001), one exhibited moderate evidence of activity (p<0.001), three demonstrated weak evidence of activity (p<0.05), and five plants showed no evidence of activity. The eight species with the strongest evidence of activity were Acacia polyacantha, Anogeissus leiocarpus, Bridelia micrantha, Cassia sieberiana, Combretum nigricans, Grewia bicolor, Strychnos spinosa and Ziziphus mucronata. In only two cases, Anogeissus leiocarpus and Cassia sieberiana, anthelmintic activity has been previously confirmed. The activity demonstrated against the levamisole resistant strain of Caenorhabditis elegans and the presence of molecules in these plants known or suspected of having a broad spectrum of activity provide support for further study of these plants and their compounds as possible treatments for parasitic worm infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
