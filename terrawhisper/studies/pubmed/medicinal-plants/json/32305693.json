Lindl leaves. The structures of all undescribed compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Structurally, maydispenoids A was characterized by a fascinating decahydro-3-oxacycloocta[cd]pentalene fragment. It is notable that the compounds 2 and 3 exhibited potential inhibitory activity in anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) stimulated murine splenocytes proliferation, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 5.28 and 9.38\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, and also suppress the murine splenocytes proliferation activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 7.25 and 16.82\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. This is the first report of ophiobolin-type sesterterpenoids as immunosuppressor, and may provide new chemical templates for the development of new immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune disease treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
