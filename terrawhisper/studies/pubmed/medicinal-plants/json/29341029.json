The aim of this study was to evaluate the active constituent petasin and its isomers isopetasin and neopetasin (petasins) in the <i>P. hybridus</i> extract Ze 339 for liberation, dissolution, absorption, and metabolism. The determination of pH-dependent thermodynamic solubility was performed via the shake-flask method. Petasins exhibited a low solubility that was pH independent. <i>In vivo</i>, the concentration of solute drugs is decreased continuously by intestinal absorption. Therefore, low solubility is not assumed to be critical for <i>in vivo</i> performance. Additionally, dissolution of an herbal medicinal product containing <i>P. hybridus</i> extract Ze 339 was assessed. Furthermore, high permeability through Caco-2 monolayers was evident. Using an <i>in situ</i> rat model, absorption capacity for petasins was found in all tested intestinal segments, namely, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Besides, high metabolism was evident both in Caco-2 monolayers and in the rat intestine. To compare intestinal and hepatic metabolism of petasins, <i>in vitro</i> enzyme assays using liver and intestinal cytosol and microsomes (S9 fraction) of rats and humans were performed. A significantly higher metabolic rate was found in the liver S9 fraction of both species compared with the intestinal S9 fraction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Zeller S\u00f6hne AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Disch", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Zeller S\u00f6hne AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Forsch", "ForeName": "Kristina", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Zeller S\u00f6hne AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Siewert", "ForeName": "Beate", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max Zeller S\u00f6hne AG, Romanshorn, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Drewe", "ForeName": "J\u00fcrgen", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ruprecht-Karls-University, Heidelberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Fricker", "ForeName": "Gert", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ze 339"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9Z0Q32J0QC", "NameOfSubstance": "petasin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D5LUE47SS6", "NameOfSubstance": "isopetasin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caco-2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Petasites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solubility"}], "CoiStatement": "The studies were supported financially by Max Zeller S\u00f6hne AG (Romanshorn, Switzerland).
