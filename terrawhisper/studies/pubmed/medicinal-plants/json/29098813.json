It plays an important role in the whole Chinese medicine industry with irreplaceable important economic and social values. However, wild resource of was abruptly depleted, and large-scale artificial cultivation has been inapplicable. In this study, Utilization history and the industrialization status of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix were summarized. Resource distribution, ecological suitability of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix and core technologies for seeds production, seedling breeding, large-scale cultivation has been reported by current studies, and basic conditions are already available for industrialization production of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix. However, there still some key technical problems need to be solved in the further research, and some policy dimensions need to be focused on in the coming industrialization cultivation of Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shun-Yuan", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hui", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hong-Lan", "Initials": "HL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100094, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jun", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environmental Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Ji-Hong", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Sichuan, Chengdu 610012, China."}], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Bing", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicaine Sciences, Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Jiu-Zhen", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Sichuan, Chengdu 610012, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Apiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crop Production"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Industrial Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29098813", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170614.015"]}}]}
