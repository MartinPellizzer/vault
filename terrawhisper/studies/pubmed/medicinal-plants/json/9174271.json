These alkaloids were hydrolyzed rapidly in alkaline solution (half lives (t1/2)<one day), were stable in solutions of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and diluted hydrochloric acid (t1/2>five months) and were unstable in solutions of methanol and ethanol (t1/2<one month). These alkaloids were separated on an octadecylsilica column with isocratic elution using a solvent mixture of tetrahydrofuran and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (14:86, v/v), which was found to be the optimal solvent of the elution systems examined. Calibration curves with UV detection were linear on injection of amounts ranging from 2.5 to 500 ng, and the limit of detection was 1 ng (S/N=3). These four alkaloids in aqueous solution were recovered almost totally by solid-phase extraction using the styrene polymer resin, Sep-Pak Plus PS-1, and were eluted using a mixture of acetonitrile and hydrochloric acid. These Aconitum alkaloids were confirmed by HPLC coupled with fast atom bombardment MS, giving their protonated molecular ions as base peaks. These alkaloids were detected by HPLC with UV detection from blood samples spiked with more than 50 ng ml(-1) of alkaloids, but were not detectable from urine samples spiked with 5 microg ml(-1) of alkaloids because of severe sample interference."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Institute of Police Science, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ohta", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seto", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsunoda", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9714109", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5207313N6E", "NameOfSubstance": "hypaconitine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "621OT356HL", "NameOfSubstance": "mesaconitine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8AR7G4VMN4", "NameOfSubstance": "jesaconitine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X8YN71D5WC", "NameOfSubstance": "Aconitine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "blood", "isolation & purification", "poisoning", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitine"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "isolation & purification", "poisoning", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9174271", "10.1016/s0378-4347(96)00471-9"]}}]}
