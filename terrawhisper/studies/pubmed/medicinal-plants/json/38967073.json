The pharmacological properties of plants are due to the presence of secondary metabolites like terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, etc. Anthraquinones represent a group of naturally occurring quinones found generously across various plant species. Anthraquinones attract a significant amount of attention due to their reported efficacy in treating a wide range of diseases. Their complex chemical structures, combined with inherent medicinal properties, underscore their potential as agents for therapy. They demonstrate several therapeutic properties such as laxative, antitumor, antimalarial, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, etc. Anthraquinones are found in different forms (derivatives) in plants, and they exhibit various medicinal properties due to their structure and chemical nature. The precursors for the biosynthesis of anthraquinones in higher plants are provided by different pathways such as plastidic hemiterpenoid 2-C-methyl-D-erthriol4-phosphate (MEP), mevalonate (MVA), isochorismate synthase and polyketide. By conducting a thorough analysis of scientific literature, this review provides insights into the intricate interplay between anthraquinone biosynthesis and its broad-ranging contributions to human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0003-1091-6979"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh-226026, India."}], "LastName": "Khatoon", "ForeName": "Mushfa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0001-4588-7683"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh-226026, India."}], "LastName": "Dubey", "ForeName": "Amita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0005-8574-0140"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biosciences, Integral University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh-226026, India."}], "LastName": "Km Verma", "ForeName": "Janhvi", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Pat Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101309942", "ISSNLinking": "1872-2083"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38967073", "10.2174/0118722083301761240628083511", "BIOT-EPUB-141458"]}}]}
