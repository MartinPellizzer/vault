The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of triphala, manjistha, or placebo dietary supplementation on gut microbiota as such studies in humans are lacking. <b><i>Design:</i></b> This was a 4-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. <b><i>Setting:</i></b> This trial was conducted at the University of California Davis, Department of Dermatology. <b><i>Subjects:</i></b> A total of 31 healthy human subjects were randomized to 3 groups. <b><i>Interventions:</i></b> The 3 groups were instructed to take 2,000 mg of either triphala, manjistha or placebo daily for 4 weeks. <b><i>Outcome Measures:</i></b> The impact of treatment on gut microbiota composition was evaluated following a 4-week dietary intervention by profiling fecal communities with 16S rRNA profiling in triphala (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20099), manjistha (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20099), or placebo (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200911) treated subjects that completed the intervention. <b><i>Results:</i></b> An average of 336 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range: 161 to 648). The analysis of gut microbiota in placebo control and herb-supplemented participants indicated that responses were highly personalized, and no taxa were uniformly altered by the medicinal herb supplementation protocol. Subjects in both treatment groups displayed a trend toward decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio and increased relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>. Both medicinal herb treatments reduced the relative abundance of Rikenellaceae, primarily reflecting changes in <i>Alistipes</i> spp. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Dietary supplementation with medicinal herbs altered fecal microbial communities. Despite the lack of a clear response signature, a group of bacterial taxa were identified that were more commonly altered in herb-supplemented participants compared to placebo controls.
