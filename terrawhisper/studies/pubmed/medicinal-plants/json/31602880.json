They have many pharmacological functions and play an important role in Chinese sumac( Rhus chinensis),which is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant. Chalcone isomerase( CHI,EC 5. 5. 1. 6) is one of the key enzymes in the flavonoids biosynthesis pathway. In this paper,the full-length c DNA sequence encoding the chalcone isomerase from R. chinensis( designated as Rc CHI) was cloned by RT-PCR and rapid-amplification of c DNA Ends( RACE). The Rc CHI c DNA sequence was 1 058 bp and the open reading frame( ORF) was 738 bp. The ORF predicted to encode a 245-amino acid polypeptide. Rc CHI gene contained an intron and two exons. The sequence alignments revealed Rc CHI shared47. 1%-71. 6% identity with the homologues in other plants. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the total flavonoid levels were positively correlated with tissue-specific expressions of Rc CHI mRNA in different tissues. The recombinant protein was successfully expressed in an Escherichia coli strain with the p GEX-6 P-1 vector. In this paper,the CHI gene was cloned and characterized in the family of Anacardiaceae and will help us to obtain better knowledge of the flavonoids biosynthesis of the flavonoid compounds in R. chinensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science,Shanxi University Taiyuan 030006,China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yue", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science,Shanxi University Taiyuan 030006,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science,Shanxi University Taiyuan 030006,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science,Shanxi University Taiyuan 030006,China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Zhu-Mei", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science,Shanxi University Taiyuan 030006,China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "chalcone isomerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rhus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602880", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190527.103"]}}]}
