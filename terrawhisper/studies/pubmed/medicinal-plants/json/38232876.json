However, the chemical structure and biological activities of polysaccharides from P. zeylanica. were still poorly understood. In this study, two water-soluble polysaccharides named WPZP-2-1 and WPZP-2-2 were purified from P. zeylanica L. Chemical and spectroscopic tests showed that the main chain of WPZP-2-1 was \u21924)-\u03b1-D-GalpA-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-\u03b1-L-Rhap-(1\u2192, and the branch chain was galactose or arabinose. The main chain of WPZP-2-2 was composed of \u21924)-\u03b1-D-GalpA-(1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)-\u03b1-L-Rhap-(1\u2192, and the O-2 and O-3 of \u21924)-\u03b1-D-GalpA had a small amount of acetylation. In addition, in vitro test showed that WPZP-2-1 and WPZP-2-2 significantly improved the inflammatory damage of LPS\u00a0+\u00a0IFN-\u03b3-induced THP-1 cells via reducing the protein levels of CD14, TLR4 and MyD88, thereby promoting IL-10 expression and inhibiting the mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. Those findings indicated that WPZP-2-1 and WPZP-2-2 from the plant should be served as the potential anti-inflammatory agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
