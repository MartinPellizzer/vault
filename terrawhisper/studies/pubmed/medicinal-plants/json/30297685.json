The aim of this study was the identification of luteolin in P. farcta extract (PFE) and to evaluate its effect on morphine discontinuation syndrome in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPCL), luteolin was evaluated in PFE. The frequency of behavioral symptoms of morphine withdrawal (jumping, rearing, and teeth chattering) induced by naloxone challenge were illustrated in morphine-dependent rats receiving PFE, luteolin, saline, or clonidine. LD50 of PFE and luteolin was 540 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg, respectively. Signs of behavioral morphine withdrawal in rats were significantly inhibited by chronic co-administration of PFE, luteolin, or clonidine with morphine. RESULTS This study showed that PFE was less effective than clonidine at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and at doses of 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg it was comparable to clonidine, and did not show a significant difference in the reduction of morphine withdrawal symptoms. Luteolin was comparable in 30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, and 90 mg/kg with clonidine to reduce the frequency of morphine withdrawal symptoms. PFE can be used as a source of luteolin. CONCLUSIONS The study findings suggest that PFE and luteolin might reduce the signs of narcotic withdrawal. Due to a similar effect to clonidine, its mechanism of action might be through the protein kinase A pathway and might have human therapeutic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moayeri", "ForeName": "Ardeshir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azimi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Ilam Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Elahe", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aidy", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran. \nCorresponding Author: Naser Abbasi, e-mail: ri.ca.malidem@n-isabba"}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Med Sci Monit Basic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101597444", "ISSNLinking": "2325-4394"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MN3L5RMN02", "NameOfSubstance": "Clonidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Clonidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Prosopis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Conflict of interest</b>.
