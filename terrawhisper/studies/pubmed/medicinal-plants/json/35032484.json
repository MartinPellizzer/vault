The increased contraction response to norepinephrine in CLP mouse aorta by LT-9 was mediated by opening of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC) verified by ex vivo experiment where LT-9 enhanced contraction response to CaCl<sub>2</sub> in the aorta while abolishing the contraction response of known VDCC opener Bay K8644. LT-9 in aortic smooth muscle cells showed Fluo-4 mediated increase in calcium fluorescence. Oral administration of LT-9 at 50 and 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup> for 15 days significantly enhanced the mean survival time, improved hemodynamic and Electrocardiogram (ECG) profile, and aortic tissue reactivity in CLP mice.
