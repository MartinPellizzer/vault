Among them, lipase (EC. 3.1.1.3) is a very prominent biocatalyst, which has the ability to catalyze the hydrolysis and synthesis of ester compounds. Many lipases have been isolated from various sources, such as animals, plants and microorganisms, among which microbial lipase is the enzyme with the most diverse enzymatic properties and great industrial application potential. It therefore has promising applications in many industries, such as food and beverages, waste treatment, biofuels, leather, textiles, detergent formulations, ester synthesis, pharmaceuticals and medicine. Although many microbial lipases have been isolated and characterized, only some of them have been commercially exploited. In order to cope with the growing industrial demands and overcome these shortcomings to replace traditional chemical catalysts, the preparation of new lipases with thermal/acid-base stability, regioselectivity, organic solvent tolerance, high activity and yield, and reusability through excavation and modification has become a hot research topic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [],
