Biologically active food supplement (BAFS) on the basis of lichens p. Cladonia was derived by mechanical-chemical biotechnology in the Educational-Research-Engineering Laboratory \"Mechanical-Chemical Biotechnology\" of the North-Eastern Federal University (NEFU). As a result of biotech impact, the solid \u03b2-glycoside bonds are destructed on \u03b2-oligosaccharide molecules, and other groups of lichen BAS is mobilized. The content of hydrolysable carbohydrates in samples of lichen increased 8 times after mechanical activation.", "The aim of investigation was to study the effects of BAFS \"Yagel-Detox\" in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2).", "The 150 patients (group 1--100 patients receiving \"Yagel-Detox\", group 2--50 patients receiving placebo) with a diagnosis DM 2 were examined. The research included: general clinical and instrumental examination, biochemical and clinical blood tests. \"Yagel-Detox\" was used 1 capsule 3 times a day, the rate of admission was 3 months.", "Clinical trials have shown that 3-month intake of BAFS \"Yagel-Detox\" reduces the concentration of blood glucose 1.3 1.6 times (in the control group--1.2 \u00f7 1.4 times), glycosylated hemoglobin--from 9.8 \u00f7 11.4% to 7.6% (in the control group--1.0%). The concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) reduced on 1.3% through 6 months.
