It is used to treat fever, diarrhoea, subcutaneous tumours, arthralgia, rheumatism, cough, amnesia and parasitic diseases in folk medicines. In this paper, we aimed to develop a simpler and faster method for the extraction of three alkaloids from Peganum harmala L. than other conventional methods by optimizing the parameters of a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method, and to investigate the acaricidal activities of three compounds against Psoroptes cuniculi.", "After optimizing the operating parameters with the single factor experiment and a Box-Behnken design combined with a response-surface methodology, a MAE method was developed for extracting the alkaloids from the seeds, and a high-performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify these compounds. An in vitro experiments were used to study the acaricidal activities.", "The optimal conditions of MAE method were as follows: liquid-to-solid ratio 31.3:1mL/g, ethanol concentration 75.5%, extraction time 10.1min, temperature 80.7\u00b0C, and microwave power 600W. Compared to the heat reflux extraction (HRE, 60min) and the ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE, 30min) methods, MAE method require the shortest time (10min) and obtain the highest yield of three compounds (61.9mg/g). Meanwhile, the LT<sub>50</sub> values for the vasicine (1.25 and 2.5mg/mL), harmaline (1.25 and 2.5mg/mL), harmine (1.25 and 2.5mg/mL) and MAE extract (100mg/mL) against Psoroptes cuniculi were 12.188h, 9.791h, 11.994h, 10.095h, 11.293h, 9.273h and 17.322h, respectively.", "The MAE method developed exhibited the highest extraction yield within the shortest time and thus could be used to extract the active compounds from Peganum harmala L. on an industrial basis. As the active compounds of Peganum harmala L., vasicine, harmalin and harmine presented the marked acaricidal activities against Psoroptes cuniculi, and could be widely applied for the treatments of acariasis in animals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
