The presence of inflammatory cells in atherosclerotic plaques of patients with stable coronary disease indicates the possibility to act by inhibiting the inflammatory phenomenon with Arnica comp.-Heel\u00ae tablets reducing the risk of instability of the plaque and, consequently, improving the clinical outcome in patients with stable coronary disease.", "Within this retrospective observational spontaneous clinical study 44 patients (31 males and 13 females) all presenting stable coronary artery disease were evaluated; 25 subjects were treated with only acetylsalicylic acid and/or clopidogrel in association with statins (standard therapeutic protocol) while for the other 18 subjects the standard therapeutic protocol was integrated with Arnica comp.-Heel\u00ae (one sublingual tablet/day). The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.", "The evaluation of the primary outcome showed that in the group of patients (18) who received the standard therapeutic protocol plus Arnica comp.-Heel\u00ae only one cardiovascular event was registered (5.6%) while in the group treated only with standard therapy 4 events were recorded in 25 patients (16%).", "The treatment with Arnica comp.-Heel\u00ae (one tablet/day) in combination with standard therapies for secondary prevention is effective in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "G.
