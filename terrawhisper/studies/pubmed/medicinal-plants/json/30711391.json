In this work, a series of 13-amino derivatives of PCL were synthesized through Michael addition reaction. Inhibition of IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling pathway and in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds were evaluated, and their effect on the cell cycle was also studied. The methyl hydroxyethylamine derivatives showed higher potency than PCL, which could induce significant mitotic arrest via G2/M arrest in HCT116 cancer cells, indicating that these derivatives have the potential to be developed into anti-colon cancer drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
