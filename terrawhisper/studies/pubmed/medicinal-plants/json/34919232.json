The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the anti-nociceptive efficacy of EO-based extracts for the management of orofacial pain (OFP).", "To address the focused question \"Are EO-based formulations effective for the management of OFP disorders?\", indexed databases were searched without time and language restrictions using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed.", "Eight studies were included and processed for data extraction. Two studies were clinical (one in adults and one in children) and 6 were performed in rodents. Results from one clinical study showed that inhalation of EO-extracts does not affect subjective toothache scores; and results from the study on children reported that inhalation of lavender oil reduces anxiety and pain during and after tooth extraction. Results from all experimental studies showed that administration of EO-extracts reduces orofacial nociceptive behavior. The ROB was high in 50% and 83.3% of the clinical and experimental studies, respectively.", "The anti-nociceptive efficacy of EO-extracts for the management of OFP remains debatable.
