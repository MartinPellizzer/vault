(VAL) are well described, demonstrating activation especially of T, T-helper cells and monocytes/macrophages. In order to characterise in detail the communication between different cell populations, we studied mistletoe-induced expression of co-stimulatory signals and their ligands by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 healthy controls were incubated for 7 days with a fermented VAL extract. VAL significantly upregulated the expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 (CD80) on monocytes/macrophages, but not B7.2 (CD86). No significant changes in the expression of either molecules on B cells could be found, suggesting that only monocytes/macrophages act as antigen presenting cells (APCs) in this in vitro system. Purified mistletoe lectins, components of most VAL extracts were also analysed, but did not induce similar responses of monocytes/macrophages. The receptor for B7 molecules, CD28, but not CTLA-4 (CD152), was also found to be significantly enhanced on CD4+ cells after VAL simulation. There was no evidence for activation of a B cell response via the CD40/CD40L pathway. Our data support the concept that stimulation by VAL extracts induces a specific T-helper cell reaction with monocytes/macrophages acting as APCs and purified lectins do not exert the same effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Krebsforschung Herdecke, Department of Applied Immunology, Communal Hospital, Germany."}], "LastName": "Stein", "ForeName": "G M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Berg", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "9005373", "ISSNLinking": "0959-8049"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigen-Antibody Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "B-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Communication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macrophage Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9849462", "10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00044-6", "S0959-8049(98)00044-6"]}}]}
