Dunal (WS) are generally related to withanolides; consistently, several strategies are under investigation to increase the concentration of these compounds in WS extracts. However, a potential toxicity of withanolides has been highlighted, thus questioning the safety of such preparations. At variance, the relative contribution of alkaloids is underrated, in spite of preliminary evidence underlining a possible pharmacological relevance. Starting from these considerations, the efficacy/safety profile of WS root extract (WSE) was compared with those of WS extracts which are enriched in alkaloids (WSA) and withanolides (WSW), respectively. MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability. The anti-inflammatory activities of the different extracts were estimated throughout the assessment of the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated release of nitric oxide (NO) and the upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 protein in RAW 264.7 cells. Both WSA and WSW were able to reduce LPS-mediated effects in RAW 264.7 cells, suggesting that alkaloids and withanolides may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of WSE. A significant higher anti-inflammatory activity and a lower toxicity were observed when WSA was compared to WSW. The present results highlighted that the contribution of alkaloids to WS pharmacological effects should not be neglected. Particularly, these compounds may concur to reach a more advantageous efficacy/safety profile when WS is used for anti-inflammatory purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 S.
