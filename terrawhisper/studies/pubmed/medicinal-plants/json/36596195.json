This work presents an unprecedented study of the proximate composition, lipid profile, a chromatographic analysis, and the antioxidant activity of extracts obtained from the pulp, peel and seeds of the fruit. The results showed that potassium, calcium, and magnesium stood out as the most abundant key minerals in the fruit peel and pulp, with an emphasis on the potassium present in the fruit pulp at 1750.0\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g. The peel had the highest content of total phenolics (374.86\u00a0mg/g), flavonoids (15.54\u00a0mg/g), tannins (27.45\u00a0mg/g) and O-diphenols (379.36\u00a0mg/g; 645.71\u00a0mg/g). The antioxidant activity (AA) was highest in the peel compared to the pulp in the DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC tests showing: IC<sub>50</sub> of 29.82; 43.67; and 407.13\u00a0\u00b5g/mL, respectively but a lower activity for the Fe<sup>2+</sup> chelator. The analysis of the lipid fractions from the peel, pulp, and seeds of the A. duckei fruit resulted in 14 types of fatty acids. The major fatty acids found in the three parts of the fruit were oleic acid (peel, 22.52\u00a0%), palmitic acid (pulp, 17.34\u00a0%), and linoleic acid (seeds, 47.99\u00a0%). The lipid profile and nutritional aspects had a PUFA/SFA ratio (0.4-1.8) in the different parts of the A. duckei fruit; the atherogenic and thrombogenic indexes were higher in the peel (1.23) and pulp (0.62), respectively. The ratio between the hypocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic fatty acids (0.5 - 3.8) calculated for the fruit are within the desirable range for a nutritious food. The chromatographic analysis of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the peel and pulp of the fruit, identified 74 VOCs, of which 60.9\u00a0% are related to terpenes, and emit notes such as cucumber, green, fatty, floral, and mint, due to the presence of substances with OAVs\u00a0>\u00a010, especially \u03b1-ionone, 1,8-cineole, 2,4-decadienal, and dodecanal. The analysis of the MS and MS/MS spectra of the chromatograms obtained by LC- QTOF-HRMS led to the identification of 26 compounds in the peel, seeds and pulp of A. duckei, such as fatty acids, phenolic acid, flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, alkaloids, and terpenoids. The results show that the pulp of A. duckei has potential as nourishing food and the nutritional and chemical aspects of the peel can be applied to commercial applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
