Proximate analysis and organoleptic tests were conducted. Method of pretreatment affected the proximate composition of the akara. The moisture, protein and fiber contents of akara prepared from BGN seeds, which were cracked and soaked or autoclaved, were significantly (p< or =0.05) different than those from soaked whole grains and flour. The cooked batch weights of the akara ranged from 258-272 g, akara from soaked whole and autoclaved seeds having the lowest and highest values, respectively. Akara from autoclaved BGN seeds was more highly preferred by panelists compared to akara from other pretreatments. Except for appearance and color, no significant differences were found between BGN akara and the cowpea akara used as reference. Heat treatment of BGN seeds prior to dehulling appeared to influence the level of acceptability of the akara."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science & Technology, The Federal Polytechnic, Idah, Kogi State, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alobo", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1992 Jan;42(1):13-23", "ArticleIdList": ["1546053"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr. 1994 Sep;46(2):147-55", "ArticleIdList": ["7855082"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10540983", "10.1023/a:1008005119326"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
