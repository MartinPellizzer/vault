However, little information is known about milRNAs and their target genes in Ganoderma lucidum. Here, we systematically predicted and characterised the milRNAs and their target genes across the three developmental stages of G. lucidum. A total of 168 unique milRNAs were predicted using a small RNA sequencing method. For them, 1612 target sequences corresponding to 1311 unique genes were predicted by degradome sequencing. We selected 42 predicted milRNAs and performed RT-PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the products. Five products were found to have sequences similar to those predicted, confirming the presence of milRNAs in G. lucidum, and demonstrating the difficulty in their validation. Among the 168 milRNAs, 111 were found to be significantly differentially expressed across the three developmental stages (q\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). The expression levels of 12 milRNAs were measured by stem-loop quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Eight of them were in line with the sequencing results (r\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.9, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). These 12 milRNAs and their target genes form 16 milRNA-target gene pairs. The expression profiles of 8 of these 16 miRNA-target pairs were negatively correlated, according to real-time quantitative analysis, whereas the other eight pairs were positively correlated. Furthermore, the results of functional enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of milRNAs mapped to the Gene Ontology terms 'GTP binding' and 'FAD binding' were enriched in specific developmental stages. These target genes were related to the biosynthesis of triterpenes and polysaccharides and lignin degradation pathway in G. lucidum. In summary, this study indicates that milRNAs may play crucial regulatory roles in various biological processes of G. lucidum and open up new avenues for research on milRNAs' biosyntheses and functions in basidiomycetes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.
