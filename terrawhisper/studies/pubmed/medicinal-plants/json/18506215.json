Reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage are the most important factors in cisplatin-induced acute renal failure. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects of crocin against cisplatin-induced acute renal failure and oxidative stress in rat.", "In this study, animals were randomly divided into 5 groups (6 each). Group one received normal saline (2 ml/day, i.p.). Group two received a single dose of cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.). Groups 3 to 5 received crocin (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p., respectively, for 4 consecutive days one hour before a single dose of cisplatin (5 mg/kg) only at the first day. Blood samples were taken out (on the fifth day) for measuring the level of urea and creatinine. The kidneys were removed for histopathological and biochemical examinations. Furthermore, 24-hour urinary factors were measured.", "Blood urea, creatinine and urinary glucose and protein concentrations in crocin-treated groups were significantly lower than those of cisplatin-treated group in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological studies showed a massive damage in S3 segment of proximal tubules in cisplatin-treated group. No damage was observed in crocin-treated groups. Crocin treatment resulted in a significant and dose-dependent reduction in malondialdehyde concentration as compared to the cisplatin-treated group. Moreover, crocin produced a significant elevation in total thiol and glutathione peroxidase concentrations, as compared with cisplatin-treated group.", "The results of the present study suggest that crocin has a protective effect against cisplatin-induced acute renal failure and relative oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Physiology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jondishapour University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naghizadeh", "ForeName": "Bahareh", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Pharmacology and Pharmacological Research Center on Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad,Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept.  of Pharmacodynamy and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vahdati Mashhadian", "ForeName": "Nasser", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Physiology Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Ahvaz Jondishapour University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mansouri", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Iran", "MedlineTA": "Iran Biomed J", "NlmUniqueID": "9814853", "ISSNLinking": "1028-852X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "877GWI46C2", "NameOfSubstance": "crocin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosuria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Proteinuria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18506215"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
