HPLC fingerprintings were obtained at the same time.", "The contents of icariin in most of the extracts are closely similar with the ones labeled by the companies. 3 type chromatograms were classified in all the HPLC fingerprintings, and were corresponded with their raw materials. The contents of epimedin C, sagittatoside B and total flavonoids were different in the samples with the same content of icariin.", "We can primarily confirm the origin of raw materials by comparing the HPLC fingerprinting of extracts with the ones of materials. The difference of extracts quality mainly comes from the difference of materials. So we suggest that Epimedium extract product should be labeled the origin of materials, and assayed with more compound contents, to ensure the quality stabilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100094, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yu-De", "Initials": "YD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Wen-Hu", "Initials": "WH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "sagittatoside B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110642-44-9", "NameOfSubstance": "epimedin C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VNM47R2QSQ", "NameOfSubstance": "icariin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18051889"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
