A C18 analytical column and a mobile phase consisting of methanol and McIlvaine buffer (pH 3) were used. T-514 was detected using a diode array detector and the chromatograms were recorded at 269 and 410 nm. A linear dependence of a peak area on the T-514 concentration (r=0.9991) was obtained in the range of 0.126-12.6 microg/ml. Limits of T-514 quantification (signal-to-noise ratio 10) in plant samples were 126 ng/ml at 410 nm and 28 ng/ml at 269 nm. T-514 was extracted from the plant material with ethyl acetate. Optimal extraction conditions were studied: number of extraction steps, volume of extracting agent and extraction time. The extracts were cleaned up using solid-phase extraction (SPE). SPE recoveries of 99.9% and 98.4% were achieved for the T-514 concentrations of 1.4 microg/ml and 0.26 microg/ml, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemical Technology, Slovak Technical University, Bratislava, Slovak Republic."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bovanov\u00e1", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brandsteterov\u00e1", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Caniov\u00e1", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Argal\u00e1sov\u00e1", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lux", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr B Biomed Sci Appl", "NlmUniqueID": "9714109", "ISSNLinking": "1387-2273"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthracenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "110270-61-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Karwinskia toxin T-514"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthracenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10517363", "10.1016/s0378-4347(99)00305-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
