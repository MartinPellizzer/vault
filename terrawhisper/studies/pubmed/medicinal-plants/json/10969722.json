We have tested the anti-ulcer actions of a novel protoberberine-type alkaloid (7,8,-dihydro-8-hydroxypalmatine (1)) obtained from the bark of E. chlorantha using the HCl/ethanol, absolute ethanol and pylorus ligation techniques. The healing effect on chronic acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer was also tested. 1 (50 and 100 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the formation of gastric ulcers induced by HCl/ethanol (35-52% inhibition), absolute ethanol (46-53% inhibition) and pylorus ligation (38-62% inhibition). The prophylactic actions were associated with significant increases in gastric mucus production compared with the controls. The significant inhibition of pylorus-ligated ulcers occurred at gastric acid concentrations (83 mEq/l) previously known to induce severe gastric ulceration in rats. The ulcer-healing test showed significant macromorphological and histological acceleration of healing following 10-day treatment with 1 (40 - 80 mg/kg). The results show that 1 has no anti-secretory effects. The prophylactic anti-ulcer effects are associated with enhanced mucus production, which is an important factor in the mechanism of the local healing process of chronic gastric ulcers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Biology and Physiology, Faculty of Science, University of Yaounde I, Cameroon."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nyasse", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Enow-Orock", "ForeName": "G E", "Initials": "GE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wafo", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Forcha", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10969722", "10.1016/S0944-7113(00)80046-X", "S0944-7113(00)80046-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
