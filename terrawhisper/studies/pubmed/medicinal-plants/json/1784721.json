The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between chewing sticks (Miswak) and gingival recession. Gingival recession was measured on the mid facial surfaces of the incisors, canines, and premolars in 238 patients presenting for routine dental appointments. All patients had been interviewed previously regarding their oral hygiene habits and use of Miswak. Patients were divided into three groups: Miswak group, toothbrush group, and Miswak/toothbrush group. The Miswak users had significantly more (P less than or equal to .05) sites gingival recession than did the toothbrush users. Furthermore, the severity of the recession was significantly more (P less than or equal to .05) pronounced in the Miswak users than it was in the toothbrush users."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Eid", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Selim", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "al-Shammery", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Quintessence Int", "NlmUniqueID": "0342677", "ISSNLinking": "0033-6572"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Devices, Home Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Recession"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Islam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Toothbrushing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1784721"]}}]}
