In view of this, present study was undertaken to investigate its antioxidant properties. Chelation, oxidation and reduction of Fe2+ and Fe3+ were measured using chelating agents 2-2' bipiridyl and potassium thiocyanate respectively. Podophyllum extract, in a dose dependent manner, chelated Fe2+ more efficiently than Fe3+ and also modulated Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio. Homogenate of mouse liver was used to measure TBARS for estimating lipid peroxidation. Podophyllum extract also inhibited lipid peroxidation in a dose dependent manner and maximum inhibition (92%) was achieved at 1000 micrograms/ml concentration. These results demonstrates that Podophyllum exhibits antioxidant properties as seen through chelation and modulation of redox state of iron ions and these may primarily contribute towards its radioprotective manifestation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Marg, Delhi 110 054, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "I P", "Initials": "IP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Iron Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Podophyllum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation-Protective Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11324151"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
