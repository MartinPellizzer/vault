To date, the genomics of this plant is unknown and the gene expression profiling of the genes related to its metabolite has never been studied before. In order to study the responses of in vitro-grown surahalala plants to abiotic stresses and the differential expression of the genes related to its essential oils under exogenous proline application; three levels of PEG600 (0, 10, and 20%) and five levels of proline (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u00a0\u00b5m) were combined in the culture media. Thus, water deficit increased oxidants levels and decreased fresh weight of surahalala tissues, whereas addition of proline up to 15\u00a0\u00b5m was able to relatively compensate the negative effect of water deficit. Contrarily, high proline level (20\u00a0\u00b5m) had a negative effect on surahalala plants probably due to the stress simulation (nutrition) under high proline concentration. In addition, the best combination for achieving highest essential oils content was 10\u00a0\u00b5m proline plus 10% PEG. The expressional profiling of the genes TPS27, L3H, TPS2, TPS1, OMT and GDH3 were successfully carried out and their involvement in 1,8-cineole, carvone, \u03b1-pinene, thymol, estragole and \u03b2-Citronellol biosynthesis, respectively, was verified. In addition, our results indicated that these genes could also be involved in the synthesis of other metabolites under water deficit condition."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022.
