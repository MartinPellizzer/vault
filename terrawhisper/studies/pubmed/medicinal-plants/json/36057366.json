In the present study, we sequenced the complete chloroplast genome (cp genome) of Cleome paradoxa. The chloroplast genome is 159,393\u00a0bp long, with a typical four-region structure: a large single copy (LSC) region of 88,191\u00a0bp, a small single copy (SSC) region of 18,620\u00a0bp, and inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb) of 26,291\u00a0bp each. The proportion of GC content was 35.79\u00a0%. The chloroplast genome of C. paradoxa contains 133 genes, 81 of which encode proteins, 29 encode tRNA, and 4 encode rRNA. We noticed a divergence in the location and number of certain genes at the IR-LSC and IR-SSC boundaries. The phylogenetic tree constructed from the complete chloroplast genome data broadly supported the taxonomic situation of Cleome paradoxa as belonging to the Cleomaceae family and Cleome species. The cp genome of C. paradoxa was rich in single sequence repeats (SSRs), with a total of 314 SSRs. Additionally, several genes were under positive selection. These results could be useful for determining the genetic variations and resolving conflicting relationships among Cleomaceae species."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
