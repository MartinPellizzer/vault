Male Wistar rats were implanted with one tripolar and two monopolar electrodes in right basolateral amygdala and dura surface, respectively. The control group was injected solvent of essential oil and two experimental groups were injected 750 and 1000 mg kg(-1) of essential oil (ip), 30 min before a daily kindling stimulation. The number of stimulations required for the first appearance of seizure stages was significantly larger in two experimental groups than in control group. Mean after discharge duration was significantly different and essential oil reduced the increase of after discharge duration. Mean after discharge amplitude was also shorter in the groups treated with essential oil than in control group. Duration time for 5th stage of seizure at fully-kindled rats was significantly shorter in two experimental groups than control group. These results suggest that Rosa damascena essential oil significantly retarded the development of seizure stages and possesses the ability to counteract kindling acquisition. The flavonoids of Rosa damascena may act via GABAA receptors as previous studies have proposed for flavonoids of other medicinal plants. More detailed studies are recommended to define the effective component(s) of Rosa on different types of epilepsy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Roohollah", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moghimi", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ejtehadi", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kheirabadi", "ForeName": "Masoumeh", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticonvulsants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Kindling, Neurologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Seizures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18819571", "10.3923/pjbs.2008.746.751"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
