Endophytic streptomyces are the link between medicinal plants and the microbial world. Edible plants endophytic streptomyces were not targeted before despite their uniqueness and importance. In this review, we analyzed the chemical diversity of more than 150 compounds belonging to endophytic Streptomyces chemical classes such as alkaloids, polyketides, peptides, macrolides and terpenes and their biological activities. This analysis showed a dominant antimicrobial effect for most of the isolated compounds and highlighted an underestimated diversity to be studied or repurposed for other biological activities. Return to edible plants use and conducting toxicity studies to rationalize their nutraceutical potential based on their beneficial endophytes is urged. Although there are many studies for non-vertebrates, the nutraceutical potential of these plants is expected to improve the gut microbiota since they are enriched with bioactive compounds from streptomyces species. This is the first review to discuss edible plants associated streptomyces, and we prospect that many studies will follow to unravel the mysterious health benefits of streptomyces in the human microbiome and encourage the revival of a correct lifestyle for the sack of a healthier microbiome."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 Wiley\u2010VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ain Shams University Faculty of Pharmacy, pharmacognosy, 24 Abdel Moutti Khyal street, Gamaa Elfath, 11566, \u00c9gypte, 11566, Cairo, EGYPT."}], "LastName": "Moussa", "ForeName": "Ashaimaa Yehia", "Initials": "AY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38884446", "10.1002/cbdv.202400888"]}}]}
