The mobile phase consisted of Acetonitril-0.1% phosphoric acid with gradient elution. The column temperature was 20 degrees C, the detective wavelength was 296 nm, the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the sample injection was 20 microL.", "Fingerprint spectrum of the stems of Actinidia deliciosa was established, and 16 samples of different origin Actinidia deliciosa were detected. Twenty-eight peaks in chromatogram were common. There was a high similarity and each chromatographic peak was obtained with good separation correlation according to the technical requirements of fingerprint of Chinese traditional medicine.", "This method is accurate, reliable and provides a scientific basis for controlling the quality of the stems of Actinidia deliciosa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University, Nanning 530001, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "Han-Shen", "Initials": "HS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Linag", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2Y8906LC5P", "NameOfSubstance": "quercitrin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Actinidia"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20518300"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
