In agricultural production, MPs can not only affect the growth of crops but also affect yield. Compared with micron-sized MPs, nanoplastics (NPs) may be more harmful to plants. However, the effects of NPs on plant growth and development have attracted relatively little attention. As such, research has currently plateaued at the level of morphology and physiology, and the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, soybeans (Glycine max L.) were treated with polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) to observe phenotypic changes and measure the effects of PS-NPs on diverse aspects of soybeans. Compared to the control group, the soybean stem and root lengths were inhibited by 11.78% and 12.58%, respectively. The reactive oxygen species content and the antioxidant enzyme activities changed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The accumulation of manganese (Mn) and magnesium (Mg) in the roots revealed that root transmembrane transport was affected by PS-NPs stress. The content of salicylic acid 2-O-\u03b2-glucoside was inhibited whereas the accumulation of l-tryptophan, the precursor of auxin synthesis, was significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in leaves. Transcriptomic analysis showed that PS-NPs could affect soybean DNA repair, membrane protein transport, and hormone synthesis and response. This study revealed the toxicity of NPs to soybeans and that NPs affected a variety of biological processes through transcriptome and hormone metabolome analysis, which provides a theoretical basis to further study the molecular mechanism of the effects on plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
