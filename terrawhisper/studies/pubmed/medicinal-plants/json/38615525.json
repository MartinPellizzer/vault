In the analysis of Scutellariae Radix (SR), the pharmacopoeia of many countries stipulates that the quality control component is baicalin (\u22659% by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)). The component with highest response in SR was also baicalin detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). However, in the attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the carbonyl peak of glucuronic acid of baicalin did not appear in SR. The results of element analysis, time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance all supported the existence of baicalin magnesium salt. Based on this, this study proposes an analysis strategy guided by infrared spectroscopy and combined with multi-spectroscopy techniques to analyze the structure of organic salt components in medicinal plant. It is meaningful for the research of mechanisms, development of new drugs, and quality control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
