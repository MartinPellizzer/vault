This study was conducted to examine the effects of the treatment of DAS and garlic homogenates on the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with DAS i.g. at daily doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg for 8 days, causing the hepatic catalase activity to decrease by 55 and 95%, respectively. Such a decrease in hepatic catalase activity was also observed when the DAS treatment was extended to 29 days. Western blot analysis showed that the DAS treatments resulted in corresponding decreases in the liver catalase protein level. No significant change in the catalase activity in the kidney, lung, and brain was observed with the treatments, but a slight decrease in heart catalase activity was observed. These treatments did not cause significant changes in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities in these tissues. Treatment with DAS at a daily dose of 200 mg/kg for 1-7 days resulted in a gradual decrease in the liver catalase activity to 5% of the control level, but it did not decrease the erythrocyte catalase activity. Treatment of rats with fresh garlic homogenates (2 or 4 g/kg, i.g., daily for 7 days) caused a 35% decrease in liver catalase activity. A/J mice treated with DAS and garlic homogenates also showed a decrease in the liver catalase activity. Diallyl sulfone (DASO2), a DAS metabolite, however, did not effectively decrease catalase activity in mice. The catalase activity was not inhibited by either DAS or DASO2 in vitro. The present results demonstrate that treatment with DAS and garlic homogenates decrease the hepatic catalase level in rats and mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Cancer Research, College of Pharmacy, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "J Y", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "So", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hussin", "ForeName": "A H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "ES03938", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES05022", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "ES05693", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Mol Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9717231", "ISSNLinking": "1095-6670"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16841-48-8", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl sulfone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfones"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "5"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10098897", "10.1002/(sici)1099-0461(1999)13:3/4<127::aid-jbt2>3.0.co;2-x", "10.1002/(SICI)1099-0461(1999)13:3/4<127::AID-JBT2>3.0.CO;2-X"]}}]}
