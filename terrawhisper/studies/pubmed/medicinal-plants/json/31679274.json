Traditional literature suggests that many herbal or natural medicines can be easily made available for the management of urolithiasis and its consequences.", "The data used for this study were collected from various research /review articles, Internet sources, and text books. Literature regarding epidemiology and pharmacological studies performed by various researchers were taken into consideration in this review. The data from the last few decades, reported in different formats, were analyzed.", "The present review reveals the severity of the progression of the occurrence of urolithiasis worldwide. The epidemiology gave in this review clearly indicates that stress-related factors and dietary complications, the key factors in the development of urolithiasis. are increasing. In this review, we acknowledge the limitations of conventional therapy. Many natural drug options are abundantly available throughout the world and can be useful for the management of urolithiasis. Future Perspectives: The development of a suitable formulation of bioactive components obtained from natural sources is being widely researched. However, traditional remedies that are very helpful in the management of urolithiasis and its related complications require scientific support and appropriate standardization for the assessment of their quality and dosage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMIMS, School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shirpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Patle", "ForeName": "Ajay", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMIMS, School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shirpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Hatware", "ForeName": "Ketan Vinayakrao", "Initials": "KV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMIMS, School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shirpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "NMIMS, School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, Shirpur, Maharashtra, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Sanjay", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Suresh Gyan Vihar University."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Gaurav", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urolithiasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31679274", "10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2019029075", "2a1f3ff2521fee54,53500b3e78808b4b"]}}]}
