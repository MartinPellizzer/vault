Later, kinetic functions were evaluated on an elevated rotating rod. No long-term influences of the treatments were observed on this task. Significant positive influences of ginseng were observed in the position reversal task. The learning deficits observed in the saline control brain-damaged rats were significantly attenuated in the ginseng-treated animals. An analysis of trial 2 response accuracy across reversals revealed enhanced cognitive abilities (i.e. acquisition of a win-stay, lose-shift strategy) in both the brain damaged and sham control rats administered ginseng. Generally, administration of the higher dose resulted in better performance in the learning paradigm. The exact mechanism responsible for these promising results remains to be discovered. Several possible mechanisms are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychology, Georgia College and State University, Milledgeville 31061, USA."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McDaniel", "ForeName": "W F", "Initials": "WF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neuroreport", "NlmUniqueID": "9100935", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4965"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Damage, Chronic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Learning"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Prefrontal Cortex"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9631476", "10.1097/00001756-199805110-00066"]}}]}
