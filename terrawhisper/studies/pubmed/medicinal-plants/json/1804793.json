Other, more weakly IgE-binding allergens were seen in the range of 40,000-60,000 M(r). HPLC followed by RAST inhibition demonstrated that components of approximately 17,000 M(r) were also responsible for much of the IgE-binding activity of the extract. These components appeared to have pI values between 4.5 and 5.2. RAST inhibition showed that there were no common IgE-binding epitopes in grass pollen and plantain pollen extracts, indicating that skin test responses should not necessarily be interpreted in terms of cross-reaction. 82 subjects with a clinical history of seasonal, respiratory allergy were screened in a skin prick test survey. 28% were skin test positive to plantain pollen extract. The frequency of positive skin test reactions to plantain pollen extract was greater than that to Betula (23%) and Artemisa (16%), both which are considered to be important allergens. In a larger survey positive RAST scores to plantain pollen were given by 34% of sera from subjects with respiratory allergy. Plantain pollen sensitivity should therefore be considered during diagnosis of seasonal allergy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bencard Allergy Research Unit, SmithKline Beecham, Epsom, Surrey, UK."}], "LastName": "Mehta", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wheeler", "ForeName": "A W", "Initials": "AW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Arch Allergy Appl Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "0404561", "ISSNLinking": "0020-5915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioallergosorbent Test"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1804793", "10.1159/000235497"]}}]}
