Recent studies have shown that up to 10 % of India's urban population and 2 % of the rural population above the age of 15 years have diabetes and WHO had declared India as the diabetic capital of the world. India has wealth of medicinalplants, and these plants have credited to the development of therapeutic agents for various ailments and diseases. Hark of Salacia Reticulata was screened for its hypoglycemic and hypo-lipidaemic effect. A- total of 60 type II diabetics were enrolled, consisting of experimental group 30 and control group 30. Experimental group received 2 grams of Kadalazhinjil powder daily for a period of 90 days and control group did not receive any supplements. Blood glucose levels before and after medications were estimated in both groups at baseline and at 90 days. There was insignificant reduction in fasting blood glucose, HbA(1) c and lipid levels at the end of 90 days in the supplemented group. The experimental group showed encouraging results which call for long term supplementation in Diabetes Mellitus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lecturer in Food Service Management and Dietetics Department, Avinashilingam University for Women, Coimbatore 641 043, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Radha", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amrithaveni", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Anc Sci Life", "NlmUniqueID": "8307589", "ISSNLinking": "0257-7941"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2012", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["22557337", "PMC3336296"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
