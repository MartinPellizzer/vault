Based on morphological observation and microscopic identification of different structures, we chose Anhui, Henan, Jilin, and Shanxi Province to study Pulsatilla chinensis (Bunge) Regel populations. We specifically addressed different diameters and anatomical structures of different parts of underground organs. We also found that P. chinensis (Bunge) Regel had a \"joint point\" structure in its underground organ. Above the \"joint point\" is the rhizome, below the \"joint point\" is the root. The main medicinal organ is the rhizome. The protective tissues of the endothelial layer of P. chinensis (Bunge) Regel changed in the process of its development. The protective tissues were replaced by epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and phloem. With the secondary growth, the endothelial cells have been radial division. This study showed that morphology and microscopic identification was an important mean of medicinal material identifications, and it had the characteristics of a convenient, fast, and intuitive method to identify the composition and structural characteristics of P. chinensis (Bunge) Regel medicinal parts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wen-Hao", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6006-8291"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4656-1543"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Hua-Sheng", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Anhui University of Chinese Medicine, Hefei, Anhui, 230031, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Jiang-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Microsc Res Tech", "NlmUniqueID": "9203012", "ISSNLinking": "1059-910X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "chemistry", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Pulsatilla"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28621842", "10.1002/jemt.22888"]}}]}
