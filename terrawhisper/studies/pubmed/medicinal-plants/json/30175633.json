The present study is the first to analyze the biotechnological potential of microemulsion systems for therapeutic purposes, through transdermal route, for pain treatment.", "Patents were searched in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), European Patent Office (Espacenet), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and National Institute of Intellectual Property (INPI). The inclusion criteria were published patents containing the keywords; 'microemulsion' and 'transdermal' in their title or abstract. 208 patents were found. However, only those patents which mentioned in their abstract or in their description the use of microemulsion system (object of invention) for pain treatment were selected. Were excluded duplicate patents and those that did not report pharmacological use of MEs specifically for pain treatment. Thus, sixteen patents were selected and described in the present study.", "Patents were found that focused specifically on the development process of microemulsion systems, the inclusion of essential oils in microemulsions, which place microemulsions as delivery systems for NSAIDs and other substances, as well as microemulsions for transdermal administration. These studies reinforce the therapeutic applicability of MEs in the treatment of acute and chronic pain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lima", "ForeName": "Marluce Pereira Damasceno", "Initials": "MPD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Lopes", "ForeName": "Everton Moraes", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gomes", "ForeName": "La\u00e9rcio da Silva", "Initials": "LDS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Fran\u00e7a", "ForeName": "Ana Rita de Sousa", "Initials": "ARS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Acha", "ForeName": "Boris Timah", "Initials": "BT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmacy, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Carvalho", "ForeName": "Andr\u00e9 Luis Menezes", "Initials": "ALM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Medicinal Plants Research nucleus, Center of Health Sciences , Federal University of Piau\u00ed , Teresina , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Almeida", "ForeName": "Fernanda Regina de Castro", "Initials": "FRC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Ther Pat", "NlmUniqueID": "9516419", "ISSNLinking": "1354-3776"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Emulsions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emulsions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patents as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30175633", "10.1080/13543776.2018.1519025"]}}]}
