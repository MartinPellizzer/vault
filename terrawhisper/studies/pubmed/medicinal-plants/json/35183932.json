Here we examined if SsnB also possesses antithrombotic activity and the underlying mechanisms.", "Anti-thrombotic effects of SsnB were determined by measuring in vitro/ex vivo/in vivo clotting times, platelet aggregation assay, production and activity of factor Xa, nitric oxide, and expressions of relative proteins.", "Treatment with SsnB prolonged the clotting time of human platelet-poor serum at concentrations comparable to the clinical anticoagulant rivaroxaban (as a positive control) and inhibited human platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or the thromboxane A2 analog U46619. SsnB also inhibited U46619-induced and ADP-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC)\u03b32/protein kinase C (PKC) and intracellular calcium mobilization, both of which are required for platelet aggregation. In addition, SsnB inhibited expression of the cell adhesion factors P-selectin and PAC-1. SsnB increased production of the vasodilator nitric oxide and suppressed secretion of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 from ADP- or U46619-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Further, SsnB reduced coagulation factor Xa (FXa) catalytic activity and production by endothelial cells as well as FXa-induced platelet aggregation.", "Finally, SsnB injection reduced thrombus formation time, number, size, and related mortality in mouse models of thromboembolism. SsnB is a promising antithrombotic agent targeting both FXa and platelet aggregation pathways, which can overcome the side effects of existing antithrombotic agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
