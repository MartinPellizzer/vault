Artapilosine A (<b>1</b>) is the first compound representative of a new class of phenanthrene derivatives having an unprecedented carbon skeleton, in which the six-membered nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structure in a typical aporphine alkaloid was substituted with a unique five-membered carbocyclic ring. This is the first report of the formation of a carbon-carbon bond between C-5 and C-6a in <b>1</b> with the loss of the nitrogen atom N-6 in the classic aporphine alkaloid. Artapilosine B (<b>2</b>) is a novel phenanthrene derivative having a hydroxyethyl as a substituent on the phenanthrene ring. Their chemical structures as well as absolute configurations were determined based on analysis of spectroscopic data. Additionally, the potential anti-HIV activities of all isolates <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> were appraised. Artapilosines A (<b>1</b>) and B (<b>2</b>) showed notable anti-HIV reverse transcriptase affects, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 20.93 and 125.29 nM, respectively. These results suggested that the discovery of these novel phenanthrene derivatives from <i>A. pilosus</i> with remarkable anti-HIV effects could be essentially important for the researching and developing of new anti-HIV agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education and Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yan-Ping", "Initials": "YP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tong-Wei", "Initials": "TW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Zhen", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Bian", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yun-Yao", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Ruo-Qing", "Initials": "RQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ze-Yu", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 211198, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qiang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang-Ying", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1282-2178"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Engineering Research Center for Industrialization of Southern Medicinal Plants Resources of Hainan Province and College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571126, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Yan-Hui", "Initials": "YH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aporphines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "13NS2KTD6H", "NameOfSubstance": "aporphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "448J8E5BST", "NameOfSubstance": "phenanthrene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Annonaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-HIV Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Aporphines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34812640", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00896"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
