The optimal compounding of medium that induced calli from stems and leaves were the MS medium supplemented with 2,4-D 2.0 mg/L, NAA 0.5 mg/L and BA 1.0 mg/L and the MS medium with 2,4-D 0.5 mg/L and NAA 2.0 mg/L, respectively. Numerous shoots could formed directly when leaf explants were cultured on the MS medium with BA 3.0 mg/L and NAA 1.0 mg/L and calli were cultured on the MS medium with BA 2.0 mg/L and IAA 1.0 mg/L. The MS medium supplemented with BA 2.0 mg/L, IAA 0.1 mg/L was optimal for shoots growth. For the root growth was 1/2 MS medium with 1.0 mg/L IBA. At pH 6.0 and 0.8% - 1.0% agar was optimal for callus and shoot formation, while pH 5.8 and 0.6% - 0.7% agar was optimal for root formation. The tube seedling can be successfully transplanted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710061, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cui-Qin", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe-Zhi", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16850712"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
