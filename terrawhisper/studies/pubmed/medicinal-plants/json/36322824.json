Using <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, we demonstrated that 2-PE suppressed mycelium growth <i>in vitro</i> and in strawberry fruit and reduced natural disease without adverse effects to fruit quality. 2-PE caused structural damage to mycelia, as shown by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. From RNA sequencing analysis we found significantly upregulated genes for enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging systems including sulfur metabolism and glutathione metabolism, indicating that ROS stress was induced by 2-PE. This was consistent with results from assays demonstrating an increase ROS and hydrogen peroxide levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, and malondialdehyde content in treated cells. The upregulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter genes, the downregulation of major facilitator superfamily transporters genes, and the downregulation of ergosterol biosynthesis genes indicated a severe disruption of cell membrane structure and function. This was consistent with results from assays demonstrating compromised membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation. To summarize, 2-PE exposure suppressed <i>B. cinerea</i> growth through ROS stress and cell membrane disruption."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7504-5332"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Utilization and Conservation of Food and Medicinal Resources in Northern Region, Henry Fok School of Food Science and Engineering, Shaoguan University, Shaoguan 512005, China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Xiurong", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2177-2301"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Yingying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0633-2335"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Shu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7056-9575"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hongfei", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "the Bio-ultrastructure Analysis Laboratory of the Key Laboratory of Applied Marine Biotechnology of the Ministry of Education, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Zhan", "ForeName": "Pingping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0724-8186"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Managing Biotic and Chemical Threats to the Quality and Safety of Agro-products, Zhejiang-Malaysia Joint Research Laboratory for Agricultural Product Processing and Nutrition, College of Food and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ningbo University, Ningbo 315800, China."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Xingfeng", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "ML9LGA7468", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Botrytis cinerea"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylethyl Alcohol"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Botrytis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36322824", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06187"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
