The chemical structures of these undescribed isolates were determined by analyses of 1D and 2D NMR and MS data, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and chemical transformation. Biogenetically, elaeocarpudubins A and B might be derived from cucurbitacin F through Michael addition with vitamin C and (-)-catechin, respectively. These six isolates were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against human leukemia HL-60, human lung adenocarcinoma A549, human hepatoma SMMC-7721, human breast cancer MCF-7, human colon cancer SW480, and paclitaxel-resistant A549 (A549/Taxol) cell lines, for their antioxidant properties using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, and for their differentiation effects on nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12\u00a0cells. Cucurbitacins F (IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.98-38.11\u00a0\u03bcM) and D (IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.03-4.40\u00a0\u03bcM) showed growth-inhibitory activities against these six cancer cell lines. Elaeocarpudubin B (IC<sub>50</sub> of 61.04\u00a0\u03bcM) and elaeocarpudoside B (IC<sub>50</sub> of 6.93\u00a0\u03bcM) showed antioxidant activities. Elaeocarpudubin B and elaeocarpudoside B also showed neurite outgrowth-promoting activities in PC12\u00a0cells at a concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
