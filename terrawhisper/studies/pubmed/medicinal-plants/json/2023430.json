Many of the uses, however, are magical in nature. Those in which a cause-effect relationship may be established (56) are presented in this paper. A review of the ethnomedical and experimental literature showed that medicinal plant uses in Seberida fall into three categories: those for which uses are corroborated by similar medicinal uses for the same plant or different species of the same genus in other cultures, those for which uses of the plant or species of the same genus are corroborated by evidence of relevant pharmacological activity in the experimental literature and those for which the medicinal uses are not corroborated. A discussion of these categories is presented. Taken as a whole, the medicinal uses of plants in Seberida are characterized by a remarkably high proportion of plants used to treat fevers and malaria and by a high proportion of species of which the leaves are used (externally or internally) for medicinal purposes. Comparison with other studies reported in the literature seems to indicate that a high frequency of the use of leaves in therapy may be a part of a larger cultural phenomenon among the tropical forest tribes of Southeast Asia and the southern Pacific Islands. Possible rationales for this type of use are offered."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbarium Bogoriense, Center for Research in Biology, LIPI, Bogor, Indonesia."}], "LastName": "Mahyar", "ForeName": "U W", "Initials": "UW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burley", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gyllenhaal", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soejarto", "ForeName": "D D", "Initials": "DD"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "N01-CM-67925", "Acronym": "CM", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "45"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2023430", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90007-z", "0378-8741(91)90007-Z"]}}]}
