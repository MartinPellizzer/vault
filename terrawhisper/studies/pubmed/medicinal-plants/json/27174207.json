Plants were collected from Car Nicobar of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using agar well diffusion method. Among the plants tested, J.\u00a0syringifolium, D.\u00a0andamanica, C.\u00a0indicum were most active. The antimalarial activity was evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-sensitive MRC-2 isolate. The crude extract of M.\u00a0andamanica showed excellent antimalarial activity followed by extracts of P.\u00a0tithymaloides, J.\u00a0syringifolium and D.\u00a0andamanica. The chemical injury to erythrocytes was also carried out and it showed that, there were no morphological changes in erythrocytes by the methanol crude extracts. The in\u00a0vitro antimicrobial and antimalarial activity might be due to the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, triterpenes, sterols, tannins and saponins in the methanol extracts of tested plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
