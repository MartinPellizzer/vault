Among all of these derivatives, several displaying the same acrylate moiety on the B ring exhibited potent inhibition, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.29 to 10.46\u00a0\u03bcM. A functional study of the most potent of these compounds, designated 6b, revealed that it significantly suppressed the transcriptional expression of inflammatory factor IL-1\u03b2 in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages, and also mildly inhibited CCL2, IL6 and TNF-\u03b1. In addition, compound 6b was found to inhibit IL-1\u03b2 released in LPS-induced BMDM cells. This study demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of 6b on LPS-stimulated inflammatory mediator production in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 correlates with the suppression of the NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
