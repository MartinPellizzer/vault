Its development relies on the continuous discovery of efficient and low-toxic differentiation inducers, including plant-derived active components that offer significant biological utilization and therapeutic potential. For this reason, the exploration of plant-derived inducers, particularly in their application in differentiation therapy, holds great promise in advancing cancer treatment strategies toward more effective and safer alternatives.", "This paper aims to provide a valuable reference for researchers seeking to identify natural, efficient, and low-toxic differentiation inducers from plants and highlights a promising research direction for the application of differentiation therapy in malignant tumor treatment.", "For the collection of pertinent information, an extensive search was conducted across diverse literature and electronic databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, ACS, CNKI, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar. This comprehensive approach aimed to retrieve and include all relevant literature from 1985 to 2023. Primary keywords such as \"Natural medicinal plant,\" \"Differentiation therapy,\" and \"Differentiation inducer\" were utilized, supplemented by secondary search terms including \"Cancer,\" \"Tumor,\" \"Herbal medicine,\" \"Induced differentiation,\" and \"Cancer treatment.\"", "This study systematically evaluated the application of plant-derived inducers in tumor-induced differentiation therapy. Through extensive literature review, specific plant components with confirmed differentiation-inducing properties were identified. Furthermore, potential molecular mechanisms underlying this process were outlined, shedding light on the future development of differentiation therapy in cancer treatment.", "Plant-derived active components exhibit substantial biological utility and therapeutic potential. Delving deeper into the research on these components as differentiation inducers holds promise for the selection of novel cancer drugs and the unveiling of novel pathways for cancer treatment. These results emphasize the importance of continued exploration and in-depth research into natural, efficient, and low-toxic differentiation inducers from plants, which could significantly advance cancer treatment strategies. Moreover, the highlighted research direction underscores the relevance of differentiation therapy in the context of malignant tumor treatment, indicating its potential as a safer and more effective alternative in cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
