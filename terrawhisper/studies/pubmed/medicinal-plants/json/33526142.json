Industrial hemp is defined as Cannabis sativa L. with a total \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u0394-9-THC) content \u22640.3%. Therefore, for hemp to become an agricultural commodity, it is important to regulate production by developing standard methods for sampling and testing of the plant material.", "An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analytical method for the quantification of twelve cannabinoids was developed. The method was applied to a regulatory sampling trial of three hemp varieties cultivated for cannabidiol (CBD) production. Two samples were taken from 28 plants with one sample being flower only while the other was a composite sample that included flowers, leaves, and stems.", "The assay method was validated for specificity, range, repeatability, reproducibility, and recovery in accordance with all applicable standards for analytical methods. The results of the regulatory study indicated a significant decrease in the concentration of total \u0394-9-THC and total CBD of 0.09% and 1.32%, respectively, between a flower only and a composite sample.", "There are many factors that may influence reported total \u0394-9-THC content in industrial hemp. A robust analytical method was developed to analyze hemp samples in a trial regulatory study. The results indicate that the way hemp is sampled and analyzed may influence the legality of a crop, which could have negative economic and legal consequences."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Berthold", "ForeName": "Erin C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Florida Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Quincy, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Drug Development Core, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Abhisheak", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Drug Development Core, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Kamble", "ForeName": "Shyam H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Drug Development Core, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Kanumuri", "ForeName": "Siva R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "King", "ForeName": "Tamara I", "Initials": "TI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Popa", "ForeName": "Raluca", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "North Florida Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Quincy, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Freeman", "ForeName": "Joshua H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tropical Research and Education Center, University of Florida, Homestead, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Brym", "ForeName": "Zachary T", "Initials": "ZT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Drug Development Core, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA."}], "LastName": "Avery", "ForeName": "Bonnie A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.
