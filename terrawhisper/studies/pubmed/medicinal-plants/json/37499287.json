The therapeutic application of ETO is constrained by its limited solubility, weak absorption, and severe side effects. This article summarizes substantial progress made in the development of ETO nanomedicine for the treatment of cancer. It discusses various organic and inorganic nanostructures used to load or affix ETOs, such as lipids, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles (NPs), dendrimers, micelles, gold NPs, iron oxide NPs, and silica NPs. In addition, it evaluates the structural properties of these nanostructures, such as their size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and drug release mechanism, as well as their in vitro or in vivo performance. The article also emphasizes the co-delivery of ETO with other medications or agents to produce synergistic effects or combat drug resistance in the treatment of cancer. It concludes with a discussion of the challenges and potential avenues for clinical translation of ETO nanomedicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
