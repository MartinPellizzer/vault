Hormone therapy is associated with some problems and some women prefer herbal medicine to reduce vaginal atrophy. Considering the phytoestrogenic compounds present in the nettle, this study aimed to investigate the effect of the nettle vaginal cream on subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.", "This triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 84 eligible postmenopausal women aged 45-60\u00a0years, who referred to comprehensive health service centers in Aliabad Katul in 2021-2022. Women eligible for the study received 5% nettle vaginal cream and placebo for 8\u00a0weeks. Subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy were assessed before, four and eight weeks after the intervention. Data collection tools included a checklist for research unit selection, individual and midwifery characteristics questionnaire, vaginal assessment scale (VAS), vaginal pH, laboratory results of the vaginal maturation value (VMV). Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 21) and independent t-test, Mann-Whitney, chi-square, Two-way analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.", "Subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy decreased significantly after the intervention compared to before the intervention in both the nettle and placebo groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but in the comparison between groups four weeks and eight weeks after the intervention, the subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy in nettle group decreased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the nettle group, the scores of vaginal burning, vaginal dryness, vaginal itching and dyspareunia significantly improved after the intervention compared to before the intervention (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Also, in the nettle group compared to the placebo group, after the intervention, vaginal burning and vaginal dryness score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and vaginal itching score (0.004) improved significantly.", "Based on the results of the present study, Nettle vaginal cream reduced subjective symptoms of vaginal atrophy, including vaginal burning, vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women, so it is a cost-effective, available and do not have the side effects product that can be useful for menopausal women."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
