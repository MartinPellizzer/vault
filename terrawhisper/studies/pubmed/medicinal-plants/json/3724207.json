Mastic at an oral dose of 500 mg/kg produced a significant reduction in the intensity of gastric mucosal damage induced by pyloric ligation, aspirin, phenylbutazone, reserpine and restraint + cold stress. It produced a significant decrease of free acidity in 6-h pylorus-ligated rats and a marked cytoprotective effect against 50% ethanol in rats which could be reversed by prior treatment with indomethacin. The protective effect was not seen when it was given intraperitoneally in phenylbutazone and restraint + cold stress models. The reduction in the intensity of ulceration in cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcers was not found to be statistically significant in mastic-pretreated rats. The results suggest that mild antisecretory and a localized adaptive cytoprotectant action may be responsible for its anti-ulcer activity. These observations support the results of an earlier study on the clinical effectiveness of mastic in the therapy of duodenal ulcer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Said", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ageel", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Parmar", "ForeName": "N S", "Initials": "NS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mastic Resin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenal Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastic Resin"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3724207", "10.1016/0378-8741(86)90165-0", "0378-8741(86)90165-0"]}}]}
