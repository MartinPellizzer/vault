Induction of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is an effective strategy to reduce excessive generated oxidants during the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of the present study is to investigate that whether the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant features of astragalin is HO-1 dependent in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in animal study. Intratracheal LPS was performed to induce experimental ALI model. Astragalin was administrated 1\u00a0h after LPS challenge. Human lung epithelial cells were used in cell study. Samples from rats were harvested at 24\u00a0h post LPS challenge. Astragalin treatment inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cells infiltration in the lung and pulmonary edema. Astragalin treatment markedly enhanced the activity of HO-1 compared with vehicle-treated group at 24\u00a0h post LPS challenge. Levels of lipid hydroperoxide, a marker for oxidative stress, were decreased in astragalin-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated group. However, the protective effect of astragalin on LPS-induced ALI was abolished in an inhibitor of HO-1-treated animals. Moreover, the astragalin-induced the upregulation of HO-1 in human lung epithelial cells was inhibited when nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was silenced by small interfering RNA. Astragalin reduces LPS-induced ALI via activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 58 Zhongshan Er Road, Guangzhou, 510000, GuangDong, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Donghua", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510000, GuangDong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dawei", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 58 Zhongshan Er Road, Guangzhou, 510000, GuangDong, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510000, GuangDong, China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Yukun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, No. 58 Zhongshan Er Road, Guangzhou, 510000, GuangDong, China. zjclassi@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tai", "ForeName": "Qiang", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Kaempferols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "APM8UQ3Z9O", "NameOfSubstance": "astragalin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Heme Oxygenase-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Kaempferols"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31250343", "10.1007/s12272-019-01171-8", "10.1007/s12272-019-01171-8"]}}]}
