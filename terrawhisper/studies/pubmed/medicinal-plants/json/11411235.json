It was found in shake flasks that oxygen supply exhibited significant influence on the production of taxol. Further investigation in bioreactor showed that noly 1.5 mg/L taxol was produced when DO(dissolved oxygen) level was 20%. Taxol production increased when DO level was increased to 40%-60%. Moreover, taxol accumulation was remarkably improved by the cultivation of cells initially at the DO level of 60% during the growth phase for 14 days followed by changing the DO level to 20%-40% during the taxol production phase for another 10 days. An optimum taxol level of 7.2 mg/L was obtained by the dissolved oxygen controlled process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China. jie_luo@163.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "X G", "Initials": "XG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Suspensions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suspensions"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11411235"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
