The results of studies in animals and humans have suggested a potential role for boron as a modulator of the steroid hormone pathway.", "As part of a study to obtain baseline information on boron in humans, the boron content of selected foods (66 items) consumed in Australia was determined. Mean values are presented for the element per 100 g or 100 ml of food and per serving.", "Major sources of the element were nuts, dried fruits, legumes, fresh vegetables and fruits. The boron content of these foods correlated positively and strongly with values provided by the comprehensive Finnish Tables of mineral composition of foods and with the US Food and Drug Administration Total Diet Study. Because of the similarity in methods employed by this study and that used for the comprehensive Finnish Tables, the latter was used to analyze the boron content in 7-day weighed food records of 32 subjects.", "Using data obtained from the food records and assigning the corresponding values from the Finnish Tables for the boron content of foods, the average daily consumption of boron for a selected group of Australians was found to be 2.23 +/- 1.23 mg/day."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, Australia."}], "LastName": "Naghii", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wall", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Samman", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Coll Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8215879", "ISSNLinking": "0731-5724"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9E3X5056Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Boron"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Australia"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Boron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet Records"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8951740", "10.1080/07315724.1996.10718638"]}}]}
