Among 18 species distributed in India, Sida acuta, Sida cordifolia, Sida rhombifolia, and Sida cordata are used in traditional medicines along with its possible adulterant Abutilon indicum for several therapeutic uses. The non-availability of marker-based validated methods for the identification and classification of these species leads to adulteration. Indoloquinoline and quinazoline are the major bioactive alkaloids distributed in Sida spp. First time, a simple, economical and high throughput method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of 20-hydroxyecdysone (1), vasicine (2), vasicinone (3), cryptolepine (4), quindolinone (5), and cryptolepinone (6) using HPTLC-UV densitometry. The method was validated to meet globally accepted ICH guidelines. The method was sensitive with LOD and LOQ ranging from 0.38-0.63 and 1.57-2.12\u00a0\u00b5g/band. The samples were spiked at 3 different concentrations, the recovery values were 93.49-98.88%. In addition, the greenness index of the HPTLC method was estimated using four different greenness assessment techniques. Targeted HPTLC analysis indicated the distribution of specialized metabolites in Sida spp. and A. indicum. However, the occurrence of cryptolepine in A. indicum was not reported in the literature, so this was further confirmed by liquid chromatographic studies of the samples from different locations. The chromatographic data was statistically evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HCA). HPTLC-based targeted metabolite quantitation explains the adulteration/substitution in Sida raw material and derived herbal preparations."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
