This underlines research undertaken here regarding the risks of contamination by A. flavus and the subsequent formation of aflatoxins on and in soya beans. We have studied on parallel lines soya beans and other legumes important in the local dietary habits. These legumes are either obtained locally or imported. On every specimen of legume we have tried to confirm, or otherwise, the presence of A. flavus and the aflatoxins. This was followed by experimenting on the conditions for growth and formation of aflatoxins on every one of the legumes. During subsequent experiments we have studied mixtures of legumes containing soya. Research on these lines has shown the inhibitory effects of legumes such as lentils, dried garden peas, Bengal gram, green peas, red peas, and broad beans on the growth of A. flavus and the formation of aflatoxins. Groundnut, on the other hand, seems to encourage such growth and such formation. The results of the experiments carried out, as above, lead us to conclude that soya must form part of our national food monitoring programme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Topsy", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Etudes des aflatoxines par l'Aspergillus flavus dans le soja et autres l\u00e9gumineuses."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Ann Nutr Aliment", "NlmUniqueID": "0372653", "ISSNLinking": "0003-4037"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["418721"]}}]}
