Miers, and Cedrusdeodara (Roxb. ex D.Don) G.Don, is used in Ayurveda for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions. Although this herbal decoction has been used for a long period for treating chronic inflammatory conditions, the mechanism of action of the decoction in reducing inflammatory conditions associated with chronic inflammation has not been clearly understood. Mass spectroscopy-based identification of bioactive molecules present in the decoction and its interaction with enzymes/proteins involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammation has been carried and reported in this study.", "Polyherbalism is one of the major principles of Ayurveda. Various phytoconstituents with different activities in the polyherbal decoction act on multi targets of a wide range of diseases. Balaguluchyadi kashayam is a polyherbal decoction prescribed for chronic inflammatory etiologies and the present study aims to evaluate the binding potential of the compounds, identified from Balaguluchyadi kashayam to enzymes/proteins involved in the development and progression of chronic inflammation.", "The bioactive compounds present in the Balaguluchyadi Kashayam fractions were extracted by preparative HPLC and identified using UPLC MS Q-TOF. The physicochemical characteristics and ADMET properties of the compounds were calculated using Mol soft, Swiss ADME and OSIRIS data warrior software. Then the binding interactions between the molecules and the proinflammatory mediators such as 5 Lipoxygenase, Cyclooxygenase 2, Tumor necrosis factoralpha convertase enzyme (TACE) and Caspase 1 were determined using molecular docking software Auto Dock 4.0 (http://autodock.scripps.edu/downloads).", "The identified bioactive molecules in the decoction showed a good binding affinity towards the enzymes/proteins involved in the development and progression of chronic inflammation compared to the binding affinity of known inhibitors/drugs to the respective enzymes/proteins.", "The bioactive molecules identified in Balaguluchyadi Kashayam could be developed as potential therapeutic molecules against enzymes/proteins involved in the development and progression of chronic inflammation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inflammation Research Lab, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Priyadarshini Hills, Kottayam, Kerala 686560, India."}], "LastName": "S J", "ForeName": "Rahitha Devi", "Initials": "RD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inflammation Research Lab, School of Biosciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Priyadarshini Hills, Kottayam, Kerala 686560, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar B", "ForeName": "Prakash", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Comput Aided Drug Des", "NlmUniqueID": "101265750", "ISSNLinking": "1573-4099"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.34", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.36", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.24.86", "NameOfSubstance": "ADAM17 Protein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "ADAM17 Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclooxygenase 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31749431", "10.2174/1573409915666191015113753", "CAD-EPUB-101459"]}}]}
