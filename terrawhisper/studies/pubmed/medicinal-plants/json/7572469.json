A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of PC on virus-specific protein synthesis in influenza virus-infected cells. The expression of viral glycoproteins on the surface of chick embryo fibroblasts infected with virus A/FPV, strain Rostock (H7N1) was suppressed. Virus protein synthesis was selectively inhibited as shown by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 35S-methionine-labelled proteins and proteins immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies. The inhibitory effect was dose-dependent and better pronounced when PC was applied after virus infection. Two variants of influenza virus FPV/Rostock with reduced drug susceptibility were selected. PC affected to a lesser extent the synthesis of viral proteins in cells infected with the variants as compared to the sensitive parental virus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia."}], "LastName": "Serkedjieva", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Slovakia", "MedlineTA": "Acta Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370401", "ISSNLinking": "0001-723X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chick Embryo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Influenza A virus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7572469"]}}]}
