The capability of halophytes plantation with wind deposits containing around 10% gypsum was evaluated for reclamation of saline soil and its effect on the production of <i>Sorghum bicolar</i> L., in an arid area. Two substance treatments at concentrations of 25 and 50\u2009ton ha<sup>-1</sup> gypsum and wind deposits at levels of 85 and 170\u2009ton ha<sup>-1</sup> were applied. Biological treatments were applied using halophyte plantation as a pioneer species. Sorghum was cultivated for all substance treatments and the production of sorghum was determined for the different treatments. Results indicated that the method leads to a reduction of salinity from 139 to <4 dS m<sup>-1</sup> and SAR declined from 129.6 to 6.2 after a period of 15\u2009months. The performance of wind deposits used in these experiments was higher than pure gypsum to reclaim saline soils. Maximum production of sorghum has been obtained by the treatment of 85\u2009ton ha<sup>-1</sup> wind deposit. Results indicated land reclamation and biomass production of forage seems possible when using wind deposit in the study area and therefore the wind deposit can effectively be used for reclamation of saline soil and plant production in arid environments."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3278-5300"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nature Engineering, Faculty of Agriculture & Natural Resources, Ardakan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Industrial Plants Research Institute, Ardakan University, Ardakan, Iran."}], "LastName": "KhavaninZade", "ForeName": "Ali Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2099-1580"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Natural Resources, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sodaeizadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1386-3214"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Natural Resources, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Akhavan Ghalibaf", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9019-0498"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience Engineering, Faculty of Sciences, Antwerp University, Antwerp, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Veroustraete", "ForeName": "Frank", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7888-1501"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Antwerp University Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Balzarolo", "ForeName": "Manuela", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WAT0DDB505", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saline Solution"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salt-Tolerant Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sorghum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wind"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saline Solution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "16"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35166627", "10.1080/15226514.2022.2037505"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
