Pyrethrum seeds of the variety Avadh were irradiated with gamma rays at 20 to 300\u2009Gy doses in Gamma chamber 5000 (cobalt-60 research irradiator).", "Observations gathered visually in M<sub>1</sub> based on vigor, synchronization of flowering, and flower's size. Out of 90\u2009M<sub>2</sub> families, 20 mutants were raised in M<sub>3</sub> along with the check-in preliminary evaluation trial. The four promising mutants, 1 (20\u2009Gy-3), 7 (40\u2009Gy-5), 10 (40\u2009Gy-8), 14 (60 Gy19-10) was grown for four years in a bench-scale trial (randomized block design, replicated thrice) to test the yield performance and selection of high yielding elite mutant (s). It has been found that pyrethrum is sensitive to gamma rays irradiation and produced a high range of qualitative and quantitative variations. After massive screening over four years, two promising mutants for high dry flower yield and pyrethrins content, namely 7 (40\u2009Gy-5), and 10 (40GY-8) were isolated.", "The mutagenesis changed traits mean in positive or negative directions. Pyrethrum plant is highly sensitive to gamma irradiation and produced a high range of variability in the qualitative and quantitative traits. The mutagenesis changed the mean of traits in both positive and negative directions. Due to mutagenic efficacy, two mutants 7 (40\u2009Gy-5), and 10 (40GY-8) were expressed high performance for pyrethrin percent i.e., 87.23 and 59.78% improvement over the check variety 'Avadh', with synchronous flowering. These two mutants are in the pipeline for release as a variety for cultivation in the North Indian plains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9713-8908"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants CSIR, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "Raj Kishori", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9802-0162"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemical Sciences, Laboratory of Aromatic Plants and Chiral Separation, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Chanotiya", "ForeName": "Chandan Singh", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9285-2486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR- Human Resource Development Centre Campus, Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Biotechnology, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants CSIR, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Pankhuri", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4208-2481"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants CSIR, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Anand", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Analytical Chemistry, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants CSIR, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Madan Mohan", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Radiat Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8809243", "ISSNLinking": "0955-3002"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "11"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33320726", "10.1080/09553002.2021.1864050"]}}]}
