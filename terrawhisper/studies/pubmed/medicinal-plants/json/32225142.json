Gaertn] possesses various biological and pharmacological activities because it contains abundant secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, especially rutin. Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been gradually used worldwide to induce hairy roots in medicinal plants to investigate gene functions and increase the yield of secondary metabolites. In this study, we have described a detailed method to generate A. rhizogenes-mediated hairy roots in TB. Cotyledons and hypocotyledonary axis at 7-10 days were selected as explants and infected with A. rhizogenes carrying a binary vector, which induced adventitious hairy roots that appeared after 1 week. The generated hairy root transformation was identified based on morphology, resistance selection (kanamycin), and reporter gene expression (green fluorescent protein). Subsequently, the transformed hairy roots were self-propagated as required. Meanwhile, a myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factor, FtMYB116, was transformed into the TB genome using the A. rhizogenes-mediated hairy roots to verify the role of FtMYB116 in synthesizing flavonoids. The results showed that the expression of flavonoid-related genes and the yield of flavonoid compounds (rutin and quercetin) were significantly (p < 0.01) promoted by FtMYB116, indicating that A. rhizogenes-mediated hairy roots can be used as an effective alternative tool to investigate gene functions and the production of secondary metabolites. The detailed step-by-step protocol described in this study for generating hairy roots can be adopted for any genetic transformation or other medicinal plants after adjustment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Artemisinin Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Mi", "ForeName": "Yaolei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Huaibei Normal University."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Zhihui", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Huaibei Normal University."}], "LastName": "Qian", "ForeName": "Guangtao", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Economic Crop Research Institute Sichuan Academy of Agriculture Sciences."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xiangxiao", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Science, Huaibei Normal University."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Jianping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Buckwheat Industry Technology, Guizhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qingfu", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; wsun@icmm.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Beijing for Identification and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Artemisinin Research Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; yhshi@icmm.ac.cn."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yuhua", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Vis Exp", "NlmUniqueID": "101313252", "ISSNLinking": "1940-087X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "147336-22-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Green Fluorescent Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5G06TVY3R7", "NameOfSubstance": "Rutin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Agrobacterium"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fagopyrum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Vectors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Green Fluorescent Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rutin"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transformation, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32225142", "10.3791/60828"]}}]}
