The objective of this study was to evaluate the drought tolerance of tepary bean as a function of biochemical processes linked to isozyme synthesis and changes in enzymatic activity related to proline metabolism. Mature seeds of common beans var. flor de mayo, Phoseolus vulgaris and tepary beans Phaseolus acutifolius were grown under two water conditions (irrigation and drought), and four levels of urea. Vertical electrophoresis and spectrophotometric techniques were used to evaluate protein patterns, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), proline oxidase (PO) and pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (P5C reductase) enzyme activities. These enzymes were studied because they are directly related to protein synthesis. Electrophoretic patterns showed more proteins in tepary beans than in common beans with limited irrigation. GDH showed only one isozyme, with a molecular weight between 240) to 270 kDa. A decrease in PO activity was observed in common beans under drought stress with a value of 237 micromol/min, in comparison to irrigation conditions of 580 micromol/min. GDH and P5C reductase enzymes have had higher activity in common beans than in tepary beans under water stress. There was a significant difference only in glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme with respect to urea level. The results suggest that drought tolerance of tepary beans is due to biochemical processes related to proline metabolic enzymes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico, Qro, Mexico."}], "LastName": "Camacho Barr\u00f3n", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gonz\u00e1lez de Mej\u00eda", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8W8T17847W", "NameOfSubstance": "Urea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DLQ4CIU6V", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.88", "NameOfSubstance": "1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.4.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutamate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.5.3.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glutamate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proline"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proline Oxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Urea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9839811", "10.1023/a:1008011529258"]}}]}
