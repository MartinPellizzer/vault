The extract efficiently reduced silver ions to spherical silver nanoparticles. The size was measured as 13.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2\u00a0nm from high resolution transmission electron microscopic images. The reaction yield was determined to be 99.6% using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The silver nanoparticles were highly stable for 28\u00a0days at ambient temperature without forming agglomeration or aggregation of nanoparticles. Dose-dependent antioxidant activity of the silver nanoparticles was observed in terms of the scavenging activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals. The silver nanoparticles also exerted cytotoxicity on Mus musculus skin melanoma cells (B16F10) and human lung cancer cells (A549) in a dose-dependent manner. Specifically, the cytotoxicity of the silver nanoparticles on A549 cells was closely associated with apoptotic cell death. Cellular uptake of the silver was evaluated via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and a higher percentage of silver was taken up by A549 cells (22.6%) than by B16F10 cells (17.3%). This result indicated that higher cellular uptake of silver nanoparticles resulted in higher cytotoxicity on A549 cells. Therefore, plant extracts are capable of being valuable natural sources for the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles that exhibit potent biological activities for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications in future nanomedicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Inje Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, Inje University, 197 Inje-ro, Gimhae, Gyeongnam, 50834, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ahn", "ForeName": "Eun-Young", "Initials": "EY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YAAS), 2238 Beijing Road, Kunming, 650205, Yunnan Province, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Hang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0193-9613"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Inje Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research, Inje University, 197 Inje-ro, Gimhae, Gyeongnam, 50834, Republic of Korea. youmiep@inje.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Youmie", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "20180019", "Agency": "Inje University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3M4G523W1G", "NameOfSubstance": "Silver"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Green Chemistry Technology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Silver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30972559", "10.1007/s12272-019-01152-x", "10.1007/s12272-019-01152-x"]}}]}
