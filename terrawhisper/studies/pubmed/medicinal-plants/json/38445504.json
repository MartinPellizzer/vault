Given the diverse ecological and cultural makeup of the regional states, it is likely that different ethnic groups will use the same or different plants for the same or different diseases. However, since 2019, this has not been compiled into a single study.", "The study aimed to compile and record the medicinal plants utilized in East Africa from April 2019 to June 2023 to treat various cancer types.", "The study examined 13 original studies that included ethnobotanical research conducted in East Africa. They were retrieved from several internet databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, and Research for Life. The study retrieved databases on plant families and species, plant parts used, preparation methods and routes of administration, and the country where the ethnobotanical field surveys were conducted. Graphs were produced using the GraphPad Prism 8.125 program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Tables and figures were used to present the data, which had been condensed into percentages and frequencies.", "A total of 105 different plant species from 45 different plant families were identified, including Asteraceae (14), Euphorbiaceae (12), Musaceae (8), and Apocynaceae (7). Uganda registered the highest proportion (46% of the medicinal plants used). The most commonly mentioned medicinal plant species in cancer management was <i>Prunus africana</i>. Herbs (32%), trees and shrubs (28%), and leaves (45%) constituted the majority of herbal remedies. Most herbal remedies were prepared by boiling (decoction) and taken orally (57%).", "East Africa is home to a wide variety of medicinal plant species that local populations and herbalists, or TMP, frequently use in the treatment of various types of cancer. The most frequently used families are Asteraceae and Euphorbiaceae, with the majority of species being found in Uganda. The most frequently utilized plant species is <i>Prunus africana</i>.
