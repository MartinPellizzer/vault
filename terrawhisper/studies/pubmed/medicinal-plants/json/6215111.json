The biological criterion was growth reduction in Vicia faba bean roots. Two varieties of Vicia faba were used. For Vicia faba Sutton's seeds, an RBE of 5.7 to 6.6 was obtained for 252Cf Dn + gamma doses of 0.5 to 0.2 Gy respectively and at a Dn + gamma dose rate of 0.11 Gy-1. The gamma contribution D gamma/Dn + gamma at the level of the root tipes was 0.35 and the derived RBE of the neutron emission of 252Cf was then 8.2 to 9.7. For Vicia faba Be1B and in the same irradiation conditions, an RBE of 5.1 to 6.2 was obtained for the total (n + gamma) 252Cf emission and for Dn + gamma doses of 0.4 to 0.2 Gy respectively. These values lead to an RBE of 7.4 to 9.0 for the neutron emission of 252Cf. For Vicia faba BelB, but for another source arrangement (Dn + gamma dose rate of 0.13 Gy . h-1 for 252Cf), an RBE of 5.6 to 7.5 was obtained for the total (n + gamma) emission of 252Cf and for Dn + gamma doses of 0.4 to 0.1 Gy respectively. The gamma contribution (D gamma/Dn + gamma) at the level of the root tips was 0.42, and the derived RBE of the neutron emission of 252Cf was then 8.9-12.3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Dam", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Billiet", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dutreix", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wambersie", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Efficacit\u00e9 biologique relative (EBR) du californium-252 \u00e0 faible d\u00e9bit."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "C R Seances Soc Biol Fil", "NlmUniqueID": "7505439", "ISSNLinking": "0037-9026"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioisotopes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "44448S9773", "NameOfSubstance": "Iridium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "975X05H15A", "NameOfSubstance": "Californium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Californium"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Iridium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Dosage"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Radioisotopes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Relative Biological Effectiveness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6215111"]}}]}
