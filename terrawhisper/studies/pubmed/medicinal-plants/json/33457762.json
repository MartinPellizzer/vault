We acquired its whole chloroplast genome (CP) through genome skimming. The CP genome of<i>Centella asiatica</i> was 154,771\u2009bp in length, including a large single-copy (LSC) region with 86176\u2009bp, a small single copy (SSC) region with 18107\u2009bp, and a pair of inverted repeats (IR) regions with 25,343\u2009bp. The whole AT content of the CP genome was 62.3%. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that <i>Centella asiatica</i> formed a separate clade sister to Saniculoideae and Apioideae species in the family Apiaceae. The work provides beneficial data for following researches on the genetic variation, species identification, phylogeny, and classification of <i>Centella.</i>"], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).
