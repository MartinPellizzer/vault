Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as one of the most promising antifungal drugs. However, most of the designed AMPs showed side-effects. In the present study, 10 novel peptides were designed based on the sequence of frog skin secretions peptide (Ranacyclin AJ). Among them, AKK8 (RWRFKWWKK) exhibited the strongest antifungal effect against both standard and clinically isolated drug-resistant C. albicans. AKK8 killed C.\u00a0albicans (within 30\u00a0min), and the antifungal effect lasted for 24\u00a0h, showed an efficient and long lasted antifungal effect against C. albicans. Notably, AKK8 showed low toxicity to human red blood cells and high stability in human serum. Moreover, AKK8 administration showed therapeutic effects on systemic infections mice induced by the clinical drug-resistant C.\u00a0albicans, in a dose-depended manner. These findings suggested that AKK8 may be a potential candidate for the anti-inflammation treatments for diseases caused by clinical drug-resistant C.\u00a0albicans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
