The isolates were distributed to sordariomycetes (62.63%), dothideomycetes (19.78%), eurotiomycetes (7.69%), zygomycetes (4.19%), agaricomycetes (1.09%), and mycelia sterilia (4.39%). Based on colony morphology and examination of spores, the isolates were classified into 18 taxa, of which Colletotrichum, Phomopsis and Phoma were dominant, their relative frequencies were 23.07%, 17.58% and 12.08% respectively. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi was determined and found to be significantly higher in leaf segments (50.76%), followed by root (41.53%) and stem tissues (27.69%). All the isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity and revealed that 26.37% endophytic fungi were active against one or more pathogens. Twenty four isolates showing significant antimicrobial activity were identified by sequencing the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rRNA gene. Results indicated that endophytic fungi associated with leaf were functionally versatile as they showed antimicrobial activity against most of the tested pathogens. The endophytic fungi Diaporthe phaseolorum var. meridionalis (KF193982) inhibited all the tested bacterial pathogens, whereas, Penicillium chermesinum (KM405640) displayed most significant antifungal activity. This seems to be the first hand report to understand the distribution and antimicrobial ability of endophytic fungi from ethno-medicinal plant M. malabathricum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Vineet Kumar", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Garima", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Passari", "ForeName": "Ajit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Mukesh Kumar", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Vijai Kumar", "Initials": "VK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bhim Pratap", "Initials": "BP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8300544", "ISSNLinking": "0254-8704"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Melastomataceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27097442"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
