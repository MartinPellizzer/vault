This plant has different chemical compounds classes including terpenoids, iridoids, flavonoids and phenylethanoids that have been isolated from the aerial parts of it. This review covers the plant botany, traditional medicinal uses and chemical composition of <i>S. lavandulifolia</i>, along with its biological and pharmacological activities including clinical trial data. The information of this review article was obtained from different scientific databases such as Google scholar, Science Direct, Hindawi, SID, Scopus, PubMed, and ACS as well as traditional Persian books. Pharmacological and clinical studies, especially Anxiolytic activity and anti-inflammatory on the plant are relatively low, so these studies are suggested in the future. Also, phytochemical investigation on root of the plant is necessary."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dastan", "ForeName": "Dara", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Science, Medicine & Health, and Molecular Horizons, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Illawarra Health & Medical Research Institute, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia."}], "LastName": "Dobie", "ForeName": "Christopher", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Islamic Azad University-Damghan Branch, Damghan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Zadali", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourrashid", "ForeName": "Mouhamad Hassan", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chemistry & Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Science, Medicine & Health, and Molecular Horizons, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Illawarra Health & Medical Research Institute, Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia."}], "LastName": "Skropeta", "ForeName": "Danielle", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Miran", "ForeName": "Mansour", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38189318", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2301004"]}}]}
