The identified plant species belonged mostly to the families Asparagaceae (12%), Araliaceae (12%), Apiaceae (12%), Xanthorrhoeaceae (12%) and Lamiaceae (12%). The remaining 40% of identified plant species was evenly split over seven families - Urticaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Leguminosae, Verbenaceae, Rosaceae, Compositae and Rutaceae. The most frequently used medicinal plants were Hypoxis hemerocallidea (85%), Asparagus densiflorus (68%) and Lessertia frutescens (68%). The leaves (43.5%) and roots (21.7%) were the most frequently used plant parts, usually prepared as infusions and decoctions for oral administration.", "This study provides documentation of medicinal plants used in the management of HIV and treatment of commonly associated OIs, which might provide a potential lead that will significantly contribute in reducing the burden of HIV infections in South Africa. We envisage that this paper will provide some background for further studies in developing new, effective, safe and affordable plant-derived medicines."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
