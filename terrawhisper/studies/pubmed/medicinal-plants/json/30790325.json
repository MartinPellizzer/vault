The two herbs serve as anti-inflammatory agents and are generally applied to many prescriptions. The aims of the study were to evaluate herb-drug interaction of C. bungeanae with BER and to investigate the mechanisms of the interaction action. Pre-treatment of BER caused reduction of plasma CRL in rats with increased formation of its three oxidative metabolites (M1-M3). Compared with the vehicle-treated group, the peak concentration and area under the concentration-time curve of CRL decreased by ~60% (given CRL) and ~50% (given extracts) in rats pre-treated with BER, respectively, along with 130 and 100% increases in apparent clearance. More M1-M3 were formed in liver microsomes of rats pretreated with BER (7 days) than in those pretreated with vehicle. Additionally, elevated activities of rCYPs2D2 and 1A2 (CYPs2D6 and 1A2) were observed in the BER-induced group. Up-regulated expression of hepatic rCYP2D2 (CYP2D6) was found in animals after 7 days of treatment of BER. The study illustrated that C. Bungeanae and BER produced metabolic herb-drug interaction and provided important information that combination of C. bungeanae with BER-containing herbal medicines may encounter the risk of decreased efficacy of CRL."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning, P.
