Psychosis can have serious negative effects. Like many psychiatric phenomena, psychosis has a variety of causes, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression. Antipsychotic medications, psychotherapy, and social support are the most common treatments. Antipsychotic drugs reduce the symptoms of psychosis by changing brain chemistry. Based on the mechanism of action, antipsychotics have two groups, typical and atypical. Most people who take antipsychotics experience side effects. People taking typical antipsychotics tend to have higher rates of extrapyramidal side effects, but some atypical drugs, especially olanzapine, are associated with the risk of significant weight gain, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, which, in turn, increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and premature death. Physical exercise, diet regimen, psychoeducation, monotherapy, or switching to an alternative antipsychotic are strategies to correct metabolic aberrates in atypical antipsychotic users. In light of several successful studies on the use of medicinal plants to control metabolic syndrome, this article briefly reviews the studies on some herbal medications for the management of metabolic disorders associated with atypical antipsychotics and discusses probable mechanisms. Therefore, we searched the Cochrane, Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases for works published before July, 2022, on the effect of herbal medications on antipsychotic-related metabolic abnormalities in animals or humans. We recommend that some herbal medicines may be efficient for regulating the metabolic changes related to atypical antipsychotics due to their multipotential action, and more efforts should be made to make herbal drug treatments more effective. We hope this review will be a reference for research on developing herbal therapeutics for metabolic alterations in antipsychotic customers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naghibi", "ForeName": "Hamideh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salari", "ForeName": "Roshanak", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yousefi", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khadem-Rezaiyan", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Department of Persian Medicine, School of Persian and Complementary Medicine, Sabzevar University of Medical Sciences, Sabzevar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghanbarzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fayyazi Bordbar", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N7U69T4SZR", "NameOfSubstance": "Olanzapine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antipsychotic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Olanzapine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Schizophrenia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37055899", "10.2174/1570163820666230411111343", "CDDT-EPUB-130854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
