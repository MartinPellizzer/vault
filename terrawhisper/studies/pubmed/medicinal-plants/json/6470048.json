The polypeptides were the large subunit (LSU) and the small subunit (SSU) of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO), and the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein (LHCP). The polypeptides were assayed by a sensitive radioimmune assay, and the mRNAs were assayed by hybridization to cloned DNA probes. LSU, LSU mRNA, and LHCP mRNA were detectable in etiolated seedlings but LHCP, SSU, and SSU mRNA were at or below the limit of detection. During the first 48 hr of de-etiolation under continuous white light, the mRNAs for LSU, SSU, and LHCP increased in concentration per apical bud by about 40-fold, at least 200-fold, and about 25-fold, respectively, while the total RNA content per apical bud increased only 3.5-fold. In the same period, the LSU, SSU, and LHCP contents per bud increased at least 60-, 100-, and 200-fold, respectively. The LHCP increased steadily in concentration during de-etiolation, whereas the accumulation LSU, SSU, and SSU mRNA showed a 24-hr lag. The accumulation of SSU, SSU mRNA, and LHCP mRNA showed classical red/far-red reversibility, indicating the involvement of phytochrome in the regulatory mechanism. LSU and LSU mRNA were induced equally well by red and far-red light. The LHCP failed to accumulate except under continuous illumination. These results indicate that the accumulation of SSU is controlled largely through the steady-state level of its mRNA, which is in turn almost totally dependent on light as an inducer and on phytochrome as one of the photoreceptors. The accumulation of LSU is largely but not totally determined by the level of its mRNA, which appears to be under strong photoregulation, which has yet to be shown to involve phytochrome. Phytochrome is involved in the regulation of LHCP mRNA levels but substantial levels of the mRNA also occur in the dark. LHCP accumulation is not primarily governed by the levels of LHCP mRNA but by posttranslational stabilization in which chlorophyll synthesis plays a necessary but not sufficient role."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bennett", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "G I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hartley", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "8205768", "ISSNLinking": "0730-2312"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11121-56-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochrome"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6470048", "10.1002/jcb.240250102"]}}]}
