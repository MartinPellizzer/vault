On the other hand, their chemical composition is not much studied especially of those grown in Balkan Peninsula. We have analyzed individual phenolics, tocopherols, carotenoids and chlorophylls using HPLC in berries from Sorbus aucuparia and Sorbus aria collected in different localities in Serbia and Montenegro together with the amounts of total phenolics and proanthocyanidins as well as their radical scavenging activity against DPPH radical. Berries of S.\u00a0aucuparia were richer source of polyphenolics in comparision with S.\u00a0aria and, regardless the species and locality, caffeoylquinic acids such as neochlorogenic and chlorogenic acid were the most abundant compounds. Among analyzed tocopherols the most abundant in all samples was \u03b1-tocopherol (0.48\u00a0-\u00a019.85\u00a0\u03bcg/g\u00a0dw) as it was \u03b2-carotene among carotenoids (mean concentration of 0.98\u00a0\u03bcg/g\u00a0dw in S.\u00a0aucuparia and 0.40\u00a0\u03bcg/g\u00a0dw in S.\u00a0aria, respectively). Correlation between total phenolics and DPPH radical scavenging activity was noticed. Our study represents comprehensive report on chemical composition of S.\u00a0aucuparia and S.\u00a0aria which could contribute to a better understanding of their quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Medicinal Plants Research 'Dr Josif Pan\u010di\u0107', Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161ka 1, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "\u0160avikin", "ForeName": "Katarina P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Medicinal Plants Research 'Dr Josif Pan\u010di\u0107', Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161ka 1, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Zduni\u0107", "ForeName": "Gordana M", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Biological Research 'Sini\u0161a Stankovi\u0107', University of Belgrade, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Krsti\u0107-Milo\u0161evi\u0107", "ForeName": "Dijana B", "Initials": "DB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, 1000, Ljubljana, Slovenia."}], "LastName": "\u0160ircelj", "ForeName": "Helena J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Montenegro, 81000, Podgorica, Montenegro."}], "LastName": "Ste\u0161evi\u0107", "ForeName": "Danijela D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Medicinal Plants Research 'Dr Josif Pan\u010di\u0107', Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161ka 1, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Pljevljaku\u0161i\u0107", "ForeName": "Dejan S", "Initials": "DS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R0ZB2556P8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tocopherols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tocopherols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28845915", "10.1002/cbdv.201700329"]}}]}
