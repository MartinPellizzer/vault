Only one dose was administered on any day. The mean changes of DNA-p/min in gastric aspirates after intragastric infusions of 2 and 4 g ginger were -1.37 +/- 2.3 and 6.74 +/- 3.06 respectively, which were not significant statistically. However, 6 g ginger given intragastrically showed a mean significant increase in DNA-p/min of 3.23 +/- 1.02 (P less than 0.05). Intragastric infusion of 0.3 g uncooked garlic showed a non-significant increase in DNA-p/min of 0.307 +/- 0.59. On the other hand, infusion of 0.75, 1.5 and 3 g of uncooked garlic each caused significant increase in DNA-p/min of 5.47 +/- 1.63 (P less than 0.01), 10.42 +/- 3.46 (P less than 0.01) and 29.26 +/- 4.55 (P less than 0.001) respectively. Infusion of 3 g of cooked garlic also showed significant increase in DNA-p/min of 21.43 +/- 4.62 (P less than 0.001). There was no significant difference between the effect of cooked and uncooked (3 g) garlic. Ginger in quantities of 6 g or more and garlic in quantities of 0.75 g or more cause a significant increase in exfoliation of gastric surface epithelial cells in human subjects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pai Department of Gastroenterology, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Bombay."}], "LastName": "Desai", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kalro", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choksi", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2370094"]}}]}
