Bioinformatics analysis showed that the base numbers of CmCHI1-3 open reading frame were 708,633 and 681 bp,encoding 235,210 and 226 amino acids,respectively. Three fusion proteins of about 30 kDa were successfully induced by prokaryotic expression technology,and the corresponding recombinant fusion proteins were isolated and purified by Ni-NTA resin column. Clustering analysis showed that the 3 CmCHI were homologous with Compositae plants,and CmCHI1 and CmCHI3 belonged to type \u2160 CHI. CmCHI2 belongs to type \u2163 CHI. Using \u03b2-actin as an internal reference gene,RT-qPCR was used to detect and analyze the expression of CmCHI1-3 genes in Hangju. The results showed that the expression levels of CmCHI1 and CmCHI3 were higher,while the expression levels of CmCHI2 were lower. It was concluded that CmCHI1 and CmCHI3 were the main chalcone isomerase genes involved in the synthesis of flavonoids in Hangju,and CmCHI2 was a helper gene. Flooding treatment significantly promoted the expression of CmCHI1 and CmCHI3 genes,but had no regulatory effect on CmCHI2. The above results provided a basis for further study of the molecular regulation mechanism of CHI gene in the metabolism of flavonoids in Hangju,which laid a foundation for improving the content of flavonoids in Hangju and finally improving the medicinal quality of Hangju."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials,Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials,Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Zou", "ForeName": "Qing-Jun", "Initials": "QJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials,Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Qiao-Sheng", "Initials": "QS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials,Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Medicinal Materials,Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing 210095,China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Bo-Xing", "Initials": "BX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "chalcone isomerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602848", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190325.102"]}}]}
