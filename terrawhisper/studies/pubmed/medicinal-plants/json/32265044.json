This study aimed to evaluate the polyphenolic composition as well as genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of methanolic extracts from T. arduini and T. flavum, two native species found in Montenegro. We determined the total phenolic and flavonoid contents of these plants using spectrophotometric methods; the qualitative content of polyphenolic compounds was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Genotoxicity in cultured human lymphocytes was measured in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) and comet assay in the range between 125 and 1000 \u03bcg/mL. Cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT viability assay in normal human MRC-5 fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. The content of total phenolics and flavonoids in T. arduini extract was higher than in T. flavum (200.35 mg GA/g vs. 171.08 mg GA/g; 96.32 mg RU/g vs. 78.14 mg RU/g). The polyphenolic composition of both extracts was qualitatively similar and eight phenol compounds were identified. The most commonly present phenol was caffeic acid and among four flavonoids, the most common was quercetin. Both plant extracts were genotoxic in both the CBMN and comet assays at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 \u03bcg/mL. After 72 h of exposure, the extracts of T. arduini and T. flavum were found to induce cytotoxicity in MRC-5 fibroblasts but not in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The results suggest that the constituents of both plant species are genotoxic and cytotoxic, therefore these extracts warrant additional evaluation to be safely applied in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
