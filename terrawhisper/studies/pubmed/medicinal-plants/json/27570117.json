Natural coumarins comprise five major subtypes: simple coumarins, linear furanocoumarins, angular furanocoumarins, linear pyranocoumarins and angular pyranocoumarins. Studies pertaining to the antifungal activities of linear pyranocoumarins are few, and no reports exist for the antifungal activities of angular pyranocoumarins. In order to discover more antifungal natural coumarins, we synthesised a series of simple natural coumarins and isolated several plant-based furanocoumarins and pyranocoumarins using previously described methods. The compounds were biologically evaluated against some plant fungal pathogens.", "Several of the 35 coumarins evaluated here exhibited strong activities against specific fungal species, including compound 25 (Pd-D-V, a linear pyranocoumarin), compound 26 (libanorin, an angular furanocoumarin) and compound 34 (disenecioyl khellactone, an angular pyranocoumarin). Compound 25 exhibited a high activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (EC<sub>50</sub> = 13.2\u2009\u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ); compound 34 displayed a strong antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea (EC<sub>50</sub> = 11.0\u2009\u00b5g mL<sup>-1</sup> ).", "This study demonstrates that several natural coumarins (one linear pyranocoumarin and one angular pyranocoumarin in particular) exhibit strong antifungal activities. These results call for further studies, where these coumarins can be examined as potential lead compounds for developing novel antifungal agents. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry."],
