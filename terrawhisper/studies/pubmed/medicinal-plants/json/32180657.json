Antimicrobial activity was assessed using two methods, by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the broth dilution method and determining the zone of inhibition using well diffusion method on mitis salivarius bacitracin selective for <i>S. mutans</i> and Saboraud's dextrose agar plates for <i>C. albicans</i>.

While for cloves, it was 5.5 mg/ml for both.
