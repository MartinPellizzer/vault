The extracts, standard drugs and distilled water were administered into GIT by gavage to evaluate the antipyretic effect after inducing pyrexia in mice.", "All extracts of both plants that were administered orally at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg per kg showed antipyretic property. The antipyretic effects were observed to be dose dependent. In both plants, the aqueous extract was found to have more potent antipyretic effect than the ethanol extract. No mouse manifested toxic effects at any dose levels of all the extracts for the observed period of two weeks.", "The present study show that both extracts of the investigated plants have got antipyretic effects and the extracts are effective and safe at the doses tested.
