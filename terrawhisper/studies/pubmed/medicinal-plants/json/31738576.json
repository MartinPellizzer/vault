In order to prevent the contamination in the food chain, there is an urgent need for the development of sewage sludge clean up technology. The use of non-food, multi-harvest aromatic crops for phytoremediation of sewage sludge has many benefits. Besides the eco-friendly approach, plant biomass generated can be used to extract economically important essential oil free of heavy metals. <i>Cymbopogon martinii</i> was grown in soil (s) amended with different ratios of sewage sludge (ss), that is, 100s:0ss (control), 80s:20ss, 60s:40ss, 40s:60ss, 20s:80ss, and 0s:100ss. The experiment was conducted in a plastic sack under an open environment for 1\u00a0year and harvesting was done thrice. Plant growth and essential oil yield were significantly increased with the increasing dose of sewage sludge. Accumulation of toxic metal (Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni) and micronutrient (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn) increased significantly in the shoot tissues confirmed by estimation of bioaccumulation and bioconcentration, and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalyses. Soil enzyme activities were significantly improved with the plant growth period and increased doses of sludge. Results showed <i>C. martinii</i> acts as hyper-accumulator and thus could be used for phytoremediation of sewage sludge."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Geetu", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Pankaj", "ForeName": "Umesh", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Analytical Chemistry, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Ajayakumar", "ForeName": "P V", "Initials": "PV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Soil Science, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Rajesh Kumar", "Initials": "RK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cymbopogon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31738576", "10.1080/15226514.2019.1687422"]}}]}
