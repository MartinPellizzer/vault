The data set in the subspace was visualized by means of two-dimensional grayscale images. Consequently, the characteristic fingerprint for appraising the quality of CMP was obtained.", "42 mulberry root-bark samples from three different quality classes were identified with the proposed method, which showed that the fingerprint images had satisfactory resolution and classification accuracy as high as 90.5%.", "The proposed method is a useful technique for appraising the quality of CMP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Engineering, College of Material Science & Chemical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yong-jiang", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Yi-yu", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Principal Component Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Infrared"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12774381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
