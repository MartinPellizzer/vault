Thus, the improvement of plant drought tolerance or water use efficiency/water uptake efficiency is important in modern agriculture. In this review, we mainly focus on new genetic factors for ameliorating drought tolerance or water use efficiency/water uptake efficiency of plants and explore the involvement of these genetic factors in the regulation of improving plant drought tolerance or water use efficiency/water uptake efficiency, which is a result of altered stomata density and improving root systems (primary root length, hair root growth, and lateral root number) and enhanced production of osmotic protectants, which is caused by transcription factors, proteinases, and phosphatases and protein kinases. These results will help guide the synthesis of a model for predicting how the signals of genetic and environmental stress are integrated at a few genetic determinants to control the establishment of either water use efficiency or water uptake efficiency. Collectively, these insights into the molecular mechanism underpinning the control of plant drought tolerance or water use efficiency/water uptake efficiency may aid future breeding or design strategies to increase crop yield."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9704-4944"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Medicinal Plant of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science , Jiangsu Normal University , Xuzhou , Jiangsu 221116 , People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Lai-Sheng", "Initials": "LS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stomata"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29589939", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b05990"]}}]}
