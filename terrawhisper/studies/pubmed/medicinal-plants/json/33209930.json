These factors can cause fatigue in a long time. Fatigue reduces the ability to process information and decrease to respond to hazardous conditions and will affect the safety of the environment. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between safety climate and occupational fatigue in nurses working in Zabol city.", "This cross-sectional study was performed on 143 nurses working in educational hospitals of Zabol in 2019. The proportional sampling method was used, and the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Questionnaire and the Nurses Safety Questionnaire were used for data collection. Data were analyzed using independent <i>t</i>-test, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and SPSS-21 software.", "In the present study, 57.3% were women and 42.7% were men. The mean score of occupational fatigue was 85.09 \u00b1 41.49, and the mean score of safety climate was 67.15 \u00b1 12.73. There is a significant inverse relationship between occupational fatigue and safety climate. The comparison of safety climate and its subscales between occupational and demographic variables showed that the score of male supervisors' attitude was 01.36 \u00b1 2.41 while the score of female supervisors' attitude was 8.88 \u00b1 2.61, and this difference was significant. Furthermore, cumulative burnout, the attitude of supervisors, and the safety climate were significantly different between different educational levels.", "The results of this study showed that there is a relationship between occupational fatigue and safety climate. Issues related to safety and risk factors in hospitals due to the high risk of disease outbreak and mortality, in addition to being economical, are important in terms of the human aspect as well. In addition, the activity of nursing staff is more important compared to other groups because of providing health care and communicating with patients; thus, more education about the safety climate of the workplace environment in hospitals can reduce nurses' fatigue."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2020 Journal of Education and Health Promotion."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health Engineering, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Poursadeqiyan", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health Engineering, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Arefi", "ForeName": "Maryam Feiz", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khaleghi", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nursing, Dezful University of Medical Sciences, Dezful, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghaddam", "ForeName": "Ali Sadeghi", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Sciences Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mazloumi", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Research Center, Life Style Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Raei", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Health Management and Economics Research Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hami", "ForeName": "Mahsa", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Occupational Health, Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khammar", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Educ Health Promot", "NlmUniqueID": "101593794", "ISSNLinking": "2277-9531"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Harrington J.
