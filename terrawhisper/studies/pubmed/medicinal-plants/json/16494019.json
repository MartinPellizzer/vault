The growth and nodulation of seedlings was determined after 70 days.", "Different nitrogenous compounds were able to enhance the vegetable growth of seedlings variously. The effect of (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3 on growth was better than that of KNO3. Seedlings nodulation was obviously inhibited by these nitrogenous compounds. Their inhibitory effects ranked NH4NO3 > (NH4)2SO4 > KNO3. The treatments of KNO3 and the lower concentration treatments of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2 SO4 didn't inhibit the nodulation of seedlings, but the higher concentration treatment of NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 severely inhibited nodulation or even made a no formation of nodule.", "The results showed that ammonium nitrogen the higher inhibitory ability to the nodulation of seedlings of A. cantoniensis than nitrate nitrogen. Therefore, the application of ammonium nitrogen fertilizer should be controlled in culture of the herb, which is in favor of increasing the function of biological nitrogen fixation and the quality of the medicinal materials of A. cantoniensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural College of Guangxi University, Nanning 530005, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Rong-Shao", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yong-Xiong", "Initials": "YX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sheng", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bang", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RU45X2JN0Z", "NameOfSubstance": "potassium nitrate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SU46BAM238", "NameOfSubstance": "Ammonium Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8YA51M7Y6", "NameOfSubstance": "ammonium nitrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Abrus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ammonium Sulfate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16494019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
