Several cultivars of Cymbopogon species are available for commercial cultivation in India and identification of these cultivars was conceded by means of morphological markers and essential oil constitution. Since these parameters are highly influenced by environmental factors, in most of the cases, it is difficult to identify Cymbopogon cultivars. In the present study, Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were employed to discriminate nine leading varieties of Cymbopogon since prior genomic information is lacking or very little in the genus. Ninety RAPD and 70 ISSR primers were used which generated 63 and 69\u00a0% polymorphic amplicons, respectively. Similarity in the pattern of UPGMA-derived dendrogram of RAPD and ISSR analysis revealed the reliability of the markers chosen for the study. Varietal/cultivar-specific markers generated from the study could be utilised for varietal/cultivar authentication, thus monitoring the quality of the essential oil production in Cymbopogon. These markers can also be utilised for the IPR protection of the cultivars. Moreover, the study provides molecular marker tool kit in both random and simple sequence repeats for diverse molecular research in the same or related genera."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PDPIAS, Charotar University of Science and Technology, Changa, Anand, Gujarat, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Boriavi, Anand, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Bishoyi", "ForeName": "Ashok Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Boriavi, Anand, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Anjali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Boriavi, Anand, Gujarat, India."}], "LastName": "Kavane", "ForeName": "Aarti", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ICAR-Directorate of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, Boriavi, Anand, Gujarat, India. geethaka99@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Geetha", "ForeName": "K A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cymbopogon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fingerprinting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "11", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26922722", "10.1007/s12010-016-2022-y", "10.1007/s12010-016-2022-y"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
