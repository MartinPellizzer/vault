Medicinal plants have attracted the researcher's attention for their outstanding advantages in treating many diseases, including snake venom poisoning. <i>Clitoria ternatea</i> L, is a plant popularly known for its various pharmacological effects especially, anti-snake venom property. However, the molecular mechanism behind this is poorly understood. It is reported that snake venom PLA<sub>2</sub> is an extensively studied toxic factor. This study is meant to screen the compound's capability to act as inhibitors of the <i>Daboia russelli</i> snake venom PLA<sub>2</sub> through molecular docking and dynamics studies. Our results show that among the 27 compounds taken for the study, only Kaempferol showed good interaction profile with the conserved catalytic active site residues, His48 and Asp49. The pharmacophore features of the compound also demonstrate its exact fitting at the binding pocket. Further RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and hydrogen bond analysis confirmed the stable binding of Kaempferol with PLA<sub>2</sub> through molecular dynamic simulations for 100\u2009ns. In addition, the MM/PBSA binding free energy calculation of the complex was also affirming the docking results. The binding free energy (BFE) of Kaempferolis better than the reference compound. ADME and Lipinski's rule of five reveals its drug like properties.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
