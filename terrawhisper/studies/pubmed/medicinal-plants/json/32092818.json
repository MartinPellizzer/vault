In the present study, total of 45 fungal strains were isolated from the three As contaminated sites of West Bengal, India. These strains were morphologically different and inhibited variable As tolerance (10 to 5000\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>As). Total 21 fungal isolates, tolerant up to 5000\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> AsV, were investigated for As removal (10\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> As) after 21\u00a0d of cultivation under laboratory conditions. The As bioaccumulation in fungal biomass ranged between 0.146 to 11.36\u00a0g\u00a0kg<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> biomass. Range of volatilized As was between 0.05 to 53.39\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> biomass. Most promising bioaccumulation and biovolatilization potential were observed in strains viz., 2WS1, 3WS1 and 2WS9. Strain 2WS1 showed highest As biovolatilization (53.39\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup> biomass) and was identified as Humicola sp. using ITS/5.8S rDNA gene sequencing. This is the first report of Humicola sp. having As biomethylation property. Best first 8 As biomethylating fungal strains were further tested for their As remediation and PGP potential in Bacopa monnieri plant grown in As contaminated soil (20\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>) in a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. The highest leaf stem ratio and lowest As content in leaf tissues were observed in 2WS1 inoculated Bacopa monnieri plants. The presence of arsM gene in 2WS1 strain suggests As biovolatilization as possible bioremediation and As stress mitigation strategy of 2WS1. Therefore, application of this strain of Humicola sp. strain 2WS1 in As contaminated soils could be a potential and realistic mitigation strategy for reducing As contamination to cropping system coupled with enhanced productivity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
