The ingestion of 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of aqueous or 400 mg/kg of ethanolic extracts of S. fruticosa from day one to day six of pregnancy by female rats did not cause pregnancy failure. However, the ingestion of an ethanolic extract reduced the number of viable fetuses and increased the number of resorptions in the pregnant rats. The ingestion of aqueous extract (800 mg/kg) or ethanolic extract (400 mg/kg) of S. fruticosa for 30 consecutive days by adult female rats had no effect on the occurrence of pregnancy. However, the ingestion of these extracts reduced both the number of implantations and viable fetuses and increased the number of resorptions in the pregnant females. The ingestion of aqueous extract (800 mg/kg) or ethanolic extract (400 mg/kg) of S. fruticosa for 30 consecutive days by adult male rats had no effect on the number of females impregnated by these males. However, the number of implantations and viable fetuses were reduced in females impregnated by males which ingested either aqueous or ethanolic extracts of S. fruticosa, whereas the number of resorptions was increased in females impregnated by males administered either aqueous or ethanolic extracts of S. fruticosa. On the other hand, the prenatal exposure of male and female rat offspring to 400 mg/kg ethanolic extract of S. fruticosa had no effects on the timing of testicular descent and vaginal opening, respectively. It would appear from these experiments that the ingestion of S. fruticosa may produce adverse effects on the fertility of male and female rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Jerash Private University, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Al-Hamood", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elbetieha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alkofahi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bataineh", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "J Ethnopharmacol 1998 Dec;63(3):265"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Implantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Maturation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9687083", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00016-6", "S0378-8741(98)00016-6"]}}]}
