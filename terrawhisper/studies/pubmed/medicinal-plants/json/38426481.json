(Solanaceae) has been used in tropical and subtropical countries of the world as medicinal and fruit trees. In this study, a new withanolide named withaperuvin O (<b>1</b>) and seven known ones, including physalolactone B-3-O-<i>\u03b2</i>-D-glucopyranoside (<b>2</b>), withanolide J (<b>3</b>), physapruin A (<b>4</b>), physaperuvin G (<b>5</b>), withaperuvin (<b>6</b>), withaperuvin C (<b>7</b>) and 28-hydroxywithaperuvin C (<b>8</b>), were isolated from the whole plants of <i>P. peruviana</i>. Their structures were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analyses including NMR and HR-ESI-MS. The bioactivities of these compounds against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells and cytotoxicity against HepG2 were tested. Compound <b>3</b> showed strong anti-inflammatory activities with IC<sub>50</sub> 3.55\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u00b5M (compared to positive control L-NMMA 7.72\u2009\u00b1\u20090.46\u2009\u00b5M). Compounds <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> inhibited HepG2 cell line with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 2.01\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12\u2009\u00b5M, 0.96\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05\u2009\u00b5M, respectively (Ellipticine, 0.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u2009\u00b5M). Our study indicated that compounds <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> could be new potential natural products for the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Van Cong", "ForeName": "Pham", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Thi Trang", "ForeName": "Vu", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Marine Biochemistry, VAST, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Quynh Lien", "ForeName": "Le", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Xuan Hoan", "ForeName": "Vu", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Administration Ministry of Health, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Minh Ngoc", "ForeName": "Tran", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Thai Binh University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Thai Binh, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Thanh Tuan", "ForeName": "Do", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Thi Thu Hien", "ForeName": "Do", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Van Hieu", "ForeName": "Ngo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Viet Duc", "ForeName": "Ngo", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Research and Technology Transfer, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Le Tuan Anh", "ForeName": "Hoang", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38426481", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2323539"]}}]}
