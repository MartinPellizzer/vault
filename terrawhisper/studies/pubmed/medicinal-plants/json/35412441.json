This largest group of photosynthetic prokaryotes is rich in structurally novel and biologically active compounds; several of which have been utilized as prospective drugs against cancer and other ailments, as well. Consequently, the integument of nanoparticles-synthetic approaches in cyanobacterial extracts should increase pharmacological activity. Moreover, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are small materials with diameters below 100\u2009nm that are classified into different classes based on their forms, sizes, and characteristics. Indeed, the biosynthesized AgNPs are generated with a variety of organisms, algae, plants, bacteria, and a few others, for the medicinal purposes, as the bioactive compounds of curio and some proteins from cyanobacteria have the potentiality in the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. The critical focus of this review is on the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties of cyanobacteria. This would be useful in the pharmaceutical industries in the future drug development cascades.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
