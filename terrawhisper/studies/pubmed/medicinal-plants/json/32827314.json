However, there are only a limited number of drugs clinically available against IAV infection. Further, emergence of drug-resistant strains can render those drugs ineffective. Thus there is an unmet medical need to develop new anti-influenza agents. In this study, we show that punicalagin from plants possesses strong anti-influenza activity with a low micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> value in tissue culture. Using a battery of bioassays such as single-cycle replication assay, neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay, and virus yield reduction assay, we demonstrate that the primary mechanism of action (MOA) of punicalagin is the NA-mediated viral release. Moreover, punicalagin can inhibit replication of different strains of influenza A and B viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant virus (NA/H274Y), indicating that punicalagin is a broad spectrum antiviral against both IAV and IBV. Further, although punicalagin targets NA like oseltamivir, it has a different MOA. These results suggest that punicalagin is an influenza NA inhibitor that may be further developed as a novel antiviral against influenza viruses."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley
