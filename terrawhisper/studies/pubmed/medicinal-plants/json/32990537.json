Quality control of traditional formulations ensures their safe, pure, and pharmaceutical efficacy. \"Qurs-e-Vard\", containing petals of Rosa damascena Mill., fruits of Rhus coriaria L. and roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra L. has been suggested as a hepatoprotective preparation in Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM).", "This study was directed at the evaluation of the phytochemical characterization, standardization, and in vitro antioxidant activity determination of a solid formulation and its components.", "Some qualitative and quantitative controls were performed like ash value, heavy metals investigation, and microbial contamination. The phytochemical assays were used for obtaining total phenolic and flavonoid contents with spectrophotometric methods. 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-c (DPPH) and Nitric Oxide (NO) assays were run for determining Radical scavenging activities of the formulation and its components. Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) was determined as well.", "Total phenolic contents of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts of the polyherbal formulation measured respectively, (376\u00b10.93) and (297.6\u00b10.96) mg of gallic acid/g of dry matter. Total flavonoid contents of the formulation were also measured (36.27\u00b10.98) for hydroalcoholic extract and (17.79\u00b10.86) mg of quercetin/g of dry matter for aqueous extract. The IC50 of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extract was obtained (88.14\u00b11.15) and (140.78\u00b12.98) \u03bcg/ml, respectively. NO scavenging percentages (200\u03bcg/ml) of hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts were measured (59.11\u00b12.15) and (65.08\u00b12.35).
