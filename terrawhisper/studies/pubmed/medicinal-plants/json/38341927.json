Taking Fritillariae Bulbus (FB) as a case study, we herein proposed a three-step strategy that integrates mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and multivariate statistical analysis to identify specific markers, thereby accurately identifying FBs and determining the adulteration level. First, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics method was employed to profile steroid alkaloids in five sorts of FB and screen potential differential markers. Then, the reliability of the screened markers was further verified by the distribution in different FB groups acquired from ultra-high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry-based pseudotargeted metabolomics analysis. As a result, a total of 16 compounds were screened out to be the specific markers, which were successfully applied to distinguish five FBs by using discriminant analysis model. Besides, partial least squares regression models based on specific markers allowed accurate prediction of three sets of adulterated FBs. All the models afforded good linearity and good predictive ability with regression coefficient of prediction (R<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>) >\u00a00.9 and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) <\u00a00.1. The reliable results of discriminant and quantitative analysis revealed that this proposed strategy could be potentially used to identify specific markers, which contributes to rapid chemical discrimination and adulteration detection of herbal medicines with close genetic relationship."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
