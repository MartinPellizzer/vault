Most antiviral plants contain active phytoconstituents such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and polyphenols, some of which play an important antiviral role. Herein, we present a background to viral central nervous system (CNS) infections, followed by a review of medicinal plants and bioactive compounds that are effective against viral pathogens in CNS infections.", "A comprehensive literature search was conducted on scientific databases including: PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The relevant keywords used as search terms were: \"myelitis\", \"encephalitis\", \"meningitis\", \"meningoencephalitis\", \"encephalomyelitis\", \"central nervous system\", \"brain\", \"spinal cord\", \"infection\", \"virus\", \"medicinal plants\", and \"biological compounds\".", "The most significant viruses involved in central nervous system infections are: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Enterovirus 71 (EV71), Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV), and Dengue Virus (DENV). The inhibitory activity of medicinal plants against CNS viruses is mostly active through prevention of viral binding to cell membranes, blocking viral genome replication, prevention of viral protein expression, scavenging reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and reduction of plaque formation.", "Due to the increased resistance of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) to antimicrobial therapies, alternative treatments, especially using plant sources and their bioactive constituents, appear to be more fruitful."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malekmohammad", "ForeName": "Khojasteh", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Plants Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sardari", "ForeName": "Samira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cardiff School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3NB, Wales, United Kingdom."}], "LastName": "Sewell", "ForeName": "Robert D E", "Initials": "RDE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Viral Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Viruses"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31309894", "10.2174/1570163816666190715114741", "CDDT-EPUB-99613"]}}]}
