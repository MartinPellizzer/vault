To isolate and identify the compounds having biological activity, they were further purified by each fraction of solvents, silica gel column chromatography, preparative TLC and reversed-phase HPLC. The peak in HPLC, which coincided with the inhibitory activity against elastase, was identified as a phenolic substance by using various colorimetric methods, UV and IR. IC(50) values of this phenolic substance were 26.9 mug mL(-1) for porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and 60.8 mug mL(-1) for human neutrophil elastase (HNE). This phenolic substance showed more potent activity than that of reference compounds, oleanolic acid (76.5 mug mL(-1) for PPE, 219.2 mug mL(-1) for HNE) and ursolic acid (31.0 mug mL(-1) for PPE, 118.6 mug mL(-1) for HNE). According to the Lineweaver-Burk plots, the inhibition against both PPE and HNE by this phenolic substance was competitive inhibition with the substrate. The phenolic substance from A. catechu effectively inhibited hyaluronidase activity (IC(50) : 210 mug mL(-1) ). These results suggest that the phenolic substance purified from A. catechu has an anti-ageing effect by protecting connective tissue proteins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R & D Center, Coreana Cosmetic Co.
