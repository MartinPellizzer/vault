Trade routes to the East and the influence of Arab medicine, which supplemented the knowledge of Greco-Roman physicians, enabled the foundation and development of the Salerno Medical School, whose most famous work is <i>Flos medicinae: Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum.</i> This medical textbook, written in verse and drawn up on the basis of ancient sources and empirical experiences of Salerno physicians, contains rules on how to preserve health, on diseases and the use of medicinal plants for medicinal purposes. The work was originally written in Latin, and was translated into Croatian by Franciscan Father Emerik Pavi<sup>c'</sup> (1768). It was the first medical book in the Croatian language. This paper provides an insight into the importance of <i>Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum</i> in medieval medicine and its influence on European medical literature through many translations, commentaries and analyses. In this context, ten recipes from the Croatian translation of <i>Flos medicinae</i> were researched and analysed which contain medicinal plants most of which grow in Croatia, and which were in use at that time: fig, fennel, anise, mallow, peppermint, sage, rue, nettle, celandine and willow. Most of the listed herbal drugs are used in contemporary phytotherapy and some of them have the potential for further research. The paper also deals with the particularities of the Croatian translation of this medical textbook, which can be used for further multidisciplinary research involving medicinal and pharmaceutical historians, botanists and philologists."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Zagreb Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, A.
