These fields are becoming of great interest for several high-impact scientific journals, including eCAM. The available literature in general, and a survey of reviews and original articles recently published, establishes that natural products, including extracts from medicinal plants and essential oils, retain interesting therapeutic activities, including antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic and differentiating properties. In this commentary, we focus attention on interest in networks based on complementary activation and comparative evaluation of different experimental strategies applied to the discovery and characterization of bioactive natural products. A representative flow chart is shown in the paper."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Section of Molecular Biology, Via Fossato di Mortara, 74, 44100 Ferrara, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gambari", "ForeName": "Roberto", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101215021", "ISSNLinking": "1741-427X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Cooper R, Morr\u00e9 DJ, Morr\u00e9 DM.
