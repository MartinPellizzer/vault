Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an untreatable neurodegenerative condition characterized by dementia and alterations in a patient's physiological and mental states. Since ancient times, medicinal plants have been an important source of bioactive phytochemicals with immense therapeutic potential. This review investigates new and safer alternatives for prevention and treatment of disease related to inevitable side effects associated with synthetic compounds. This review examines how nanotechnology can help in enhancing the delivery of neuroprotective phytochemicals in AD. Nevertheless, despite their remarkable neuroprotective properties, these natural products often have poor therapeutic efficacy due to low bioavailability, limited solubility and imperfect blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Nanotechnology produces personalized drug delivery systems which are necessary for solving such problems. In overcoming these challenges, nanotechnology might be employed as a way forward whereby customized medication delivery systems would be established as a result. The use of nanocarriers in the design and application of important phytochemicals is highlighted by this review, which indicate potential for revolutionizing neuroprotective drug delivery. We also explore the complications and possibilities of using nanocarriers to supply nutraceuticals and improve patients' standard of living, and preclinical as well as clinical investigations displaying that these techniques are effective in mitigating neurodegenerative diseases. In order to fight brain diseases and improve patient's health, scientists and doctors can employ nanotechnology with its possible therapeutic interventions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
