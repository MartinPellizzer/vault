To this end, the powdered root of Yashtimadhu (<i>Glycyrrhiza glabra</i> L.), commonly known as liquorice, is frequently used in Indian Ayurvedic medicine with an eye to neuroprotection but its target proteins, mechanisms of action, and metabolites remain to be determined. Using a metabolomics and network pharmacology approach, we identified 98,097 spectra from positive and negative polarities that matched to \u223c1600 known metabolites. These metabolites belong to terpenoids, alkaloids, and flavonoids, including both novel and previously reported active metabolites such as glycyrrhizin, glabridin, liquiritin, and other terpenoid saponins. Novel metabolites were also identified such as quercetin glucosides, coumarin derivatives, beta-carotene, and asiatic acid, which were previously not reported in relation to liquorice. Metabolite-protein interaction-based network pharmacology analyses enriched 107 human proteins, which included dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine neurotransmitter receptors among other regulatory proteins. Pathway analysis highlighted the regulation of signaling kinases, growth factor receptors, cell cycle, and inflammatory pathways. <i>In vitro</i> validation confirmed the regulation of cell cycle, MAPK1/3, PI3K/AKT pathways by liquorice. The present data-driven, metabolomics and network pharmacology study paves the way for further translational clinical research on neuropharmacology of liquorice and other traditional medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Systems Biology and Molecular Medicine, Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Karthikkeyan", "ForeName": "Gayathree", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sushrutha Ayurveda Hospital, Puttur, India."}], "LastName": "Pervaje", "ForeName": "Ravishankar", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Systems Biology and Molecular Medicine, Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Subbannayya", "ForeName": "Yashwanth", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Systems Biology and Molecular Medicine, Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Patil", "ForeName": "Arun H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Systems Biology and Molecular Medicine, Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Modi", "ForeName": "Prashant Kumar", "Initials": "PK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Systems Biology and Molecular Medicine, Yenepoya Research Centre, Yenepoya (Deemed to be University), Mangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Thottethodi Subrahmanya Keshava", "Initials": "TSK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "OMICS", "NlmUniqueID": "101131135", "ISSNLinking": "1536-2310"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolome"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33275529", "10.1089/omi.2020.0156"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
