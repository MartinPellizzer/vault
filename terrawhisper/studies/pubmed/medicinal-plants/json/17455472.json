The efficacy were evaluated with the time of passage of gas by anus, information of wound healing, blood routine, blood coagulaton function, liver function. Changes recovery factor, immune index and hemorheological index were detected too.", "The time of passage of gas by anus in SF group was significantly shorter than that in control group. Blood routine, blood coagulaton function, liver function showed no significant difference in the two group of preoperative and postoperative. Whole blood viscosity, blood reduced viscosity and plasma fibrinogen viscosity in SF group were significantly lower than that in control group after operation. IgG and IgA in SF group was significantly higher than that in control group after operation. IgG and CD4+/CD8+ in control group was significantly higher after operation than that in before operation. Among tissue damage plerosis correlation factor, the blood levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in SF group and control group is significantly lower than that in preoperation (P < 0.05), SOD in SF group was significantly higher than that in control group after operation. The blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in SF group and control group is significantly higher than that in preoperation (P < 0.05). MDA in SF group was significantly lower than that in control group after operation.
