The puzzling finding that alpha-mannosidase stably carries its own substrate suggests that the N-glycans have unique topologies, and important functions in protein folding, oligomerization or enzyme activity. As a first step towards the elucidation of this enigma, we purified the N-glycans of jack bean alpha-mannosidase and determined their structures by sugar composition analysis, mass spectrometry and 1H-NMR. The structures of two N-glycans were identified in an approximate ratio of one-to-one: a glucose-containing high-mannose-type glycan (Glc1Man9GlcNAc2) and a small xylose- and fucose-containing complex-type glycan (Xyl1Man1Fuc1GlcNAc2). Isolation and sequencing of glycopeptides strongly suggests that one high-mannose-type and one complex-type glycan are linked to specific glycosylation sites of the large alpha-mannosidase subunit. The high-mannose-type glycan, which is a good substrate of the endoglycosidase (endo-H), can only be removed from the enzyme after denaturation and cleavage of disulfide bonds by a reducing agent, suggesting that this glycan is buried within the folded polypeptide and, thus, protected from its hydrolytic activity. Denaturation and reduction of the native enzyme led to a marked decrease in alpha-mannosidase activity. However, the activity could largely be recovered by renaturation in an appropriate renaturation buffer. In contrast, recovery of alpha-mannosidase activity failed when the high-mannose-type glycan was removed by endo-H prior to renaturation, indicating that this glycan appears to be important for enzyme activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioresources Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Okayama University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hess", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sturm", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0107600", "ISSNLinking": "0014-2956"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.24", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Mannosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glycopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mannosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Mannosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10447685", "10.1046/j.1432-1327.1999.00598.x", "ejb598"]}}]}
