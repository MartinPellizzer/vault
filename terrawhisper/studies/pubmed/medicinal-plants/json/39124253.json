The current study aimed to determine the cause of the phenomenon and find a genetic solution to the problem. The disease was reproduced in a growth chamber using naturally-infested soil from a commercial field. Wilt became apparent within two weeks, and after ten weeks, all plants died compared to plants in sterilized soil from the same source. <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> was isolated from infected plants, and Koch's postulates were completed. Sequence analysis of the <i>Elongation Factor</i> (<i>EF1\u03b1</i>) encoding gene of the pathogen had a 99.54% match to <i>F. oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>coriandrii</i>. Several coriander varieties were screened for resistance or tolerance to the disease. In four independent experiments, only the cultivar 'Smadi' showed high tolerance, while other genotypes were susceptible. In a trial in a naturally infested field, the cultivar 'Smadi' outperformed the commercial cultivar 'Blair'. 'Smadi' provides a cropping solution to many Israeli farmers, yet this winter cultivar bolts early in the summer. There is a further need to characterize the tolerance mechanism and inheritance for informed breeding of late-bolting Fusarium-resistant coriander."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Newe Ya'ar Research Center, Volcani Institute, Ramat-Yishay 30095, Israel."}], "LastName": "Chaimovitsh", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Newe Ya'ar Research Center, Volcani Institute, Ramat-Yishay 30095, Israel."}], "LastName": "Kahane-Achinoam", "ForeName": "Tali", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot 7610001, Israel."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Weed Science, Volcani Institute, Agricultural Research Organization, Rishon LeZion 7505101, Israel."}], "LastName": "Nuriel", "ForeName": "Ohad", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Protection and Inspection Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Rishon LeZion 7505101, Israel."}], "LastName": "Meller Harel", "ForeName": "Yael", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Extension Service, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Rishon LeZion 7505101, Israel."}], "LastName": "Silverman", "ForeName": "David", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Valley of Springs Research & Extension Center, Beit She'an 11710, Israel."}], "LastName": "Nitzan", "ForeName": "Nadav", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Agriculture, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Rehovot 7610001, Israel."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Weed Science, Volcani Institute, Agricultural Research Organization, Rishon LeZion 7505101, Israel."}], "LastName": "Frenkel", "ForeName": "Omer", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2144-1561"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants, Newe Ya'ar Research Center, Volcani Institute, Ramat-Yishay 30095, Israel."}], "LastName": "Gonda", "ForeName": "Itay", "Initials": "I"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "870-6873-20", "Agency": "Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Extension Service", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "261-1821-22", "Agency": "Israel Herbs Growers Committee", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Plants (Basel)", "NlmUniqueID": "101596181", "ISSNLinking": "2223-7747"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "6"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39124253", "10.3390/plants13152135", "plants13152135"]}}]}
