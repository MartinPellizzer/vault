Individual ingredients were selected on the basis of published findings of induction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and/or catalase in rodents in vivo, combined with evidence of decreasing lipid peroxidation. Each ingredient was present at a dosage sufficiently low to avoid any accompanying unwanted pharmacological effects. Blood was analyzed before supplementation and after 30 and 120 days of supplementation (675 mg/day). Erythrocytes were assayed for SOD and catalase, and plasma was assayed for lipid peroxidation products as thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS), as well as uric acid, C-reactive protein, and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL). Before supplementation, TBARS showed a strong age-dependent increase. After 30 days of supplementation, TBARS declined by an average of 40% (p = 0.0001) and the age-dependent increase was eliminated. By 120 days, erythrocyte SOD increased by 30% (p < 0.01) and catalase by 54% (p < 0.002). We conclude that modest induction of the catalytic antioxidants SOD and catalase may be a much more effective approach than supplementation with antioxidants (such as vitamins C and E) that can, at best, stoichiometrically scavenge a very small fraction of total oxidant production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Webb-Waring Institute for Cancer, Aging and Antioxidant Research, University of Colorado Denver Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO 80262, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nelson", "ForeName": "Sally K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bose", "ForeName": "Swapan K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Grunwald", "ForeName": "Gary K", "Initials": "GK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Myhill", "ForeName": "Paul", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCord", "ForeName": "Joe M", "Initials": "JM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Free Radic Biol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8709159", "ISSNLinking": "0891-5849"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protandim"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PQ6CK8PD0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Ascorbic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ascorbic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "C-Reactive Protein"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16413416", "10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2005.08.043", "S0891-5849(05)00520-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
