Borkh.). The effects of three variables including ethanol concentration A<sub>1</sub>, solid-liquid ratio A<sub>2</sub>, extraction temperature A<sub>3</sub> were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) coupled with Box-Behnken design (BBD). The adsorption/desorption characteristics of MC on the five types of macroporous resins were investigated. According to batch adsorption test, HPD-300 resins were selected for kinetics. The adsorption mechanism showed that the process was appropriate by pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and purification parameters of MC were optimized through adsorption/desorption experiments with the column packed by HPD-300 resin. The effective fractions were obviously superior to other fractions according to DPPH, ABTS, COX-2 and 15-LOX radical scavenging. This work implies that the purified active fraction with high contents of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds from crabapple might be potential source for natural products and food industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
