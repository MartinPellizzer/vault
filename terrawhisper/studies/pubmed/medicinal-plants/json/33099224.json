It has increasingly become clear that a disturbance in the internal clocks has negative effects on our body. Terpenes are organic compounds found in various plants that are reported to have several pharmacological actions. In this study, we focused on commercially available 27 triterpenoids and evaluated their influence on the circadian rhythm of human U2OS cells and mouse NIH3T3 cells. The expression level of Per2, one of the core clock genes, was measured using luminescent reporters over the time period of a few days. We found that 8 triterpenoids reset the phase of the circadian clocks. Representative compounds were corosolic acid, cucurbitacin B, and celastrol; similar effects were also confirmed with some structural analogues of cucurbitacin B and celastrol. These compounds shifted the phase bilaterally depending on the stimulus timing and also acted as synchronizers in desynchronized cells. The effective concentrations of cucurbitacin B and celastrol were less than 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM. In addition, cucurbitacin B and celastrol were also found to be effective in tissue explants in mice. Furthermore, celastrol dose-dependently shortened the period length of NIH3T3 cells. Some of these compounds are found in edible and medicinal plants and may help regulate our circadian clocks in everyday life."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
