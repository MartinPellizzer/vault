In this view, the present study was executed to predict the anticancer potential of <i>Solanum torvum</i> Swartz. fruits derived phytocompounds against one of the breast cancer target proteins (MAPK14, PDB ID: 5ETA, resolution: 2.80\u2009\u00c5) through pharmacoinformatics-based screening and molecular dynamics simulation tools. Initially, a graph theoretical network approach was used to visualize the genes, enzymes, and proteins involved in the signalling pathway of breast cancer and identify the significant target protein (MAPK14). A total of thirty-three active compounds were selected from <i>S. torvum</i> sw. through the IMPPAT database, and their structures were drawn by Chemsketch software. The drug-like behaviours of the compounds were assessed through pharmacokinetics and physicochemical characterization studies. Five compounds, namely chlorogenin (-10.90\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>), corosolic acid (-10.80\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>), solaspigenin (-10.80\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>), paniculogenin (-10.70\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>), spirostane-3,6-dione (-10.70\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>) exhibited top binding score against MAPK14, these are higher than that of the standard drug (Doxorubicin) (-8.60\u2009kcal\u2009\u00d7\u2009mol<sup>-1</sup>). Additionally, the five top-binding compounds revealed better drug-likeness traits and the lowest toxicity profiles. MD simulation studies confirmed the stability of the top five scored compounds with the MAPK14 binding pockets. According to these findings, the selected five compounds might be used as significant MAPK14 inhibitors and can be used as new medicines for the treatment of breast cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
