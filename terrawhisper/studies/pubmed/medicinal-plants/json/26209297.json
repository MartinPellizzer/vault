Family Rosaceae dominated with 26% species followed by Moraceae (12%) and Rhamnaceae (10%), with mostly tree type of growth form (55%). The most consumed part of plants was fruit (72%) followed by leaves (21%). Decoction (26%) and unprocessed fruit (24%) were the major modes of crude drug preparation. The Informant consensus factor (ICF) of Joint/body aches was the highest followed by digestive disorders.
