Most of newly synthesized compounds (except 5i, 5m, and 5p) exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in the range of IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0\u03bcM - 9.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.47\u00a0\u03bcM. Among them, compound 5j (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a02.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0\u03bcM), bearing ethoxy at the 4-position of the phenyl ring, was found to be the most active compound in this series of compounds, with five folds more active than the standard drug cisplatin (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a015.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27\u00a0\u03bcM). In addition, compound 5j and colchicine showed the same ability to inhibit tubulin polymerization with the IC<sub>50</sub> values of 4.6\u00a0\u03bcM and 6.7\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Cellular mechanism studies elucidated that compound 5j arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 5j formed stable interactions in the colchicine-binding site of tubulin."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
