Scientific research on the healing properties and bioactivity of natural compounds, especially of plant origin, has been extensive particularly in the Western world. However, a rich heritage of floral biodiversity is found in developing countries. South Africa, a country with a strong history of traditional healing, hosts a variety of around 30000 plant species. Indigenous bulbous plants of importance to South African traditional healers mainly belong to the Amaryllidaceae and Hyacinthaceae families. A number of these plants have particular uses as disinfectants and anti-inflammatory agents, although there is still a lack of scientific research regarding their unique pharmacological compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, University of Pretoria, South Africa. camlouw@bioagric.up.ac.za"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Louw", "ForeName": "C A M", "Initials": "CA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Regnier", "ForeName": "T J C", "Initials": "TJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Korsten", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Communicable Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}], "NumberOfReferences": "60"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12241989", "10.1016/s0378-8741(02)00184-8", "S0378874102001848"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
