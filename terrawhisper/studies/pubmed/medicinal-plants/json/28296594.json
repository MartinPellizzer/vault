In the wake of this new concept, a new science-based TCM formula that counteracts various syndromes is needed. The objective of this study was to develop such a formula. Five of the most clinically prescribed TCM herbs that work on different syndromes, namely Gastrodia elata, Uncaria rhynchophylla, Pueraria thomsonii, Panax notoginseng, and Alisma orientale, were selected for this study. The fingerprints of these five herbs were analyzed by tri-step Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Three different solvents, 95% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and distilled water, were used for the maceration of the herbs and their vasodilatory effects were studied using in vitro precontracted aortic ring model. Among these, the 50% ethanolic extracts of G. elata (GE50) and A. orientale (AO50), and 95% ethanolic extracts of U. rhynchophylla (UR95), P. thomsonii (PT95), and P. notoginseng (PN95) were found to be the most effective for eliciting vasodilation. Thus, these five extracts were used for orthogonal stimulus-response compatibility group studies by using L<sub>25</sub> (5<sup>5</sup>) formula. The best combination ratio for GE50, UR95, PT95, PN95, and AO50, which was assigned as Formula 1 (F1), was found at EC<sub>0</sub>, EC<sub>25</sub>, EC<sub>20</sub>, EC<sub>20</sub>, and EC<sub>10</sub>, respectively. The vasodilatory effect of the extracts prepared from different extraction methods using F1 ratio was also studied. From the results, the EC<sub>50</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> of total 50% ethanolic extract of five herbs using F1 ratio (F1-2) were 0.028\u2009\u00b1\u20090.005\u2009mg/mL and 101.71%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.64%, with better values than F1 (0.104\u2009\u00b1\u20090.014\u2009mg/mL and 97.80%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.12%, respectively). In conclusion, the optimum ratio and appropriate extraction method (F1-2) for the new TCM formula were revealed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}], "LastName": "Loh", "ForeName": "Yean Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Chu Shan", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}], "LastName": "Ch'ng", "ForeName": "Yung Sing", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mariam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}], "LastName": "Asmawi", "ForeName": "Mohd Zaini", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia , Minden, Malaysia ."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine , Fuzhou, China ."}], "LastName": "Yam", "ForeName": "Mun Fei", "Initials": "MF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Food", "NlmUniqueID": "9812512", "ISSNLinking": "1096-620X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28296594", "10.1089/jmf.2016.3836"]}}]}
