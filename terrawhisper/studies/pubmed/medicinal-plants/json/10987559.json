At the beginning of the experiment in space, the amyloplasts were grouped at the distal pole of the statocytes by a root-tip-directed 1-g centrifugal acceleration. The seedlings were then placed in microgravity for increasing periods of time (13, 29, 46 or 122 min) and chemically fixed. During the first 29 min of microgravity there were local displacements (mean velocity: 0.154 microm min(-1)) of some amyloplasts (first at the front of the group and then at the rear). Nevertheless, the group of amyloplasts tended to reconstitute. After 122 min in microgravity the bulk of amyloplasts had almost reached the proximal pole where further movement was blocked by the nucleus. After a longer period in microgravity (4 h; experiment carried out 1994 during the IML 2 mission) the statoliths reached a stable position due to the fact that they were stopped by the nucleus. The position was similar to that observed in roots grown continuously in microgravity. Treatment with cytochalasin D (CD) did not stop the movement of the amyloplasts but slowed down the velocity of their displacement (0.019 microm min(-1)). Initial movement patterns were the same as in control roots in water. Comparisons of mean velocities of amyloplast movements in roots in space and in inverted roots on earth showed that the force responsible for the movement in microgravity (Fc) was about 86% less (Fc = 0.016 pN) than the gravity force (Fg = 0.11 pN). Treatment with CD reduced Fc by two-thirds. The apparent viscosity of the statocyte cytoplasm was found to be 1 Pa s or 3.3 Pa s for control roots or CD treated roots, respectively. Brownian motion or elastic forces due to endoplasmic reticulum membranes do not cause the movement of the amyloplasts in microgravity. It is concluded that the force transporting the statoliths is caused by the actomyosin system."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire CEMV, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France. dominique.driss@snv.jussieu.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Driss-Ecole", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jeune", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prouteau", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Julianus", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Perbal", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10987559", "10.1007/s004250000298", "10.1007/s004250000298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
