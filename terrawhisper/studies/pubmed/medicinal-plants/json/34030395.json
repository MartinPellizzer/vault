Anthropogenic emissions are causing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels to rise. Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) boosts plant growth both under optimal and suboptimal growth conditions. However, the crop-specific interaction between eCO<sub>2</sub> and soil arsenic exposure has not been investigated at the whole plant, physiological and biochemical level. Here, we tested the effects of eCO<sub>2</sub> (620\u00a0ppm) and soil As exposure (mild and severe treatments, 25 and 100\u00a0mg As/Kg soil) on growth, photosynthesis and redox homeostasis in barley (C3) and maize (C4). Compared to maize, barley was more susceptible to soil As exposure at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Barley plants accumulated more As, particularly in roots. As accumulation inhibited plant growth and induced oxidative damage in a species-specific manner. As-exposed barley experienced severe oxidative stress as illustrated by high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and protein oxidation levels. Interestingly, eCO<sub>2</sub> differentially mitigated As-induced stress in barley and maize. In barley, eCO<sub>2</sub> exposure reduced photorespiration, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, and lipid/protein oxidation. In maize eCO<sub>2</sub> exposure led to an upregulation of the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC/GSH)-mediated antioxidative defense system. Combined, this work highlights how ambient and future eCO<sub>2</sub> levels differentially affect the growth, physiology and biochemistry of barley and maize crops exposed to soil As pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
