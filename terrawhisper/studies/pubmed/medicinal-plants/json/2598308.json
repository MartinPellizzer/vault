Mueller-Arg. (Euphorbiaceae) has led to the isolation of five new hydrolyzable tannins (16-20), together with fourteen known tannins (1-14). On the basis of chemical and spectroscopic evidence, the structures of compounds 16 and 17 were established as 1,2-di-O-galloyl-3,6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-beta-D-glucose and 1-O-digalloyl-3,6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-beta-D-glucose, respectively, while compounds 18 (mallojaponin) and 19 (mallonin) were shown to be 1-O-galloyl-2,4-elaeocarpusinoyl-3,6-(R)-valoneayl-bet a-D-glucose and 1-O-galloyl-2,4-elaeocarpusinoyl-beta-D-glucose. Compound 20 (mallotusinin) was characterized as a novel ellagitannin which possesses a unique 1,1'-(3,3',4,4'-tetrahydroxy)dibenzofurandicarboxyl group. On the other hand, examination of the leaves revealed the presence of hydrolyzable tannins (8-10, 12-15) all containing a beta-D-glucopyranose core with 1C4-conformation. Furthermore, the orientation of the valoneayl group in mallotinic acid (13) and mallotusinic acid (14), which had remained unclarified, was determined on the basis of 1H-13C shift correlation spectral analysis and chemical correlations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saijo", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nonaka", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishioka", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2598308", "10.1248/cpb.37.2063"]}}]}
