The rats in MI/R group, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for 1 h and reperfused for 1 h. The rats in SND group were pretreated with Sini decoction(5 g/kg x d) for three days, the last treatment was pretreated 24 h before the index occlusion. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, the expression of PKC was measured by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Smac was analyzed by Western blotting. The activity of Caspase-3 was also measured.", "24 h after Sini Decoction treatment, Myocardial cell apoptosis significantly decreased, PKC was translocated and its expression increased, the release of Smac decreased, the activity of Caspase-3 decreased.", "Sini Decoction treatment can protect myocardial cell from apoptosis caused by MI/R, the mechanism is related to PKC activation, Mitochondria protection and in turn inhibition of Smac release, and inhibition of apoptosis signal transduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathophysiology of Guangdong Pharmacological College, Guangzhou 510006, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nie", "ForeName": "Yong-Mei", "Initials": "YM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Wei-Kang", "Initials": "WK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Western"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemic Preconditioning, Myocardial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria, Heart"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondrial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19260278"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
