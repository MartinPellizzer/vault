Schisandra chinensis, a woody vine plant belonging to the family of Magnoliaceae, is a rich source of dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans exhibiting potent activity. However, the functional role of PAL in the biosynthesis of lignan is relatively limited, compared with those in lignin and flavonoids biosynthesis. Therefore, it is essential to clone and characterize the PAL genes from this valuable medicinal plant. In this study, molecular cloning and characterization of three PAL genes (ScPAL1-3) from S. chinensis was carried out. ScPALs were cloned using RACE PCR. The sequence analysis of the three ScPALs was carried out to give basic characteristics followed by docking analysis. In order to determine their catalytic activity, recombinant protein was obtained by heterologous expression in pCold-TF vector in Escherichia coli (BL21-DE3), followed by Ni-affinity purification. The catalytic product of the purified recombinant proteins was verified using RP-HPLC through comparing with standard compounds. The optimal temperature, pH value and effects of different metal ions were determined. V<sub>max</sub>, K<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> values were determined under the optimal conditions. The expression of three ScPALs in different tissues was also determined. Our work provided essential information for the function of ScPALs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 China Pharmaceutical University. Published by Elsevier B.V.
