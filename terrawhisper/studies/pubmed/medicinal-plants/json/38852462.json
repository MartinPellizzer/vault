Herein, a wide-targeted metabolomics-based approach revealed 1199 concurrent metabolites, with further analysis of their fluctuations across with the five stages of fruit growth. The bioactive compounds in Chinese quince primarily comprised sugars and organic acids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. Moreover, 395 metabolites were identified as having medicinal properties and rutin was the most content of them. Transcriptome analysis further provided a molecular basis for the metabolic changes observed during fruit development. By thoroughly analysing metabolite and transcriptome data, we revealed changes in bioactive compounds and related genes throughout fruit development. This study has yielded valuable insights into the ripening process of Chinese quince fruit, presenting substantial implications for industrial applications, particularly in quality control."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
