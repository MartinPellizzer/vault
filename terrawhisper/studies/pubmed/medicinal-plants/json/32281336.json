Its development provides new biotechnology and methods for the study of traditional pharmacognosy. The formation of molecular biology has brought the development of pharmacognosy into a new era of gene research. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos is a classical Chinese medicine. Many scholars of home and abroad have carried out relevant studies on its molecular biology on the basis of the in-depth study with traditional methods, and have achieved certain results. In order to provide references on the method, technical for promoting the modernization of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, and the development, protection, and utilization of other traditional Chinese medicine resources. This article summarized the application status of molecular biology methods and techniques on the identification, biosynthesis of active constituents, and molecular mechanism of secondary metabolite under stress conditions of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos in recent years. In hybridization technology of tag(RFLP), molecular markers based on PCR(RAPD, AFLP, SSR and ISSR), based on DNA sequence analysis of SNP and DNA barcode for the variety identification, diagnosis, identification of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, and so forth in detail. At the same time, it is proposed that multi-omics technology can be used to build systems biology technology and platforms, and establish related models of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, so as to deepen acknowledge the molecular mechanism of the active component biosynthesis of Lonicerae Japonicae Flos and the accumulation of metabolites, life activities of other medicinal plants under adverse environment, then to regulate them."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Zhi-Chen", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xun-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Cheng", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Meng-Xia", "Initials": "MX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Li", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Mei", "ForeName": "Yu-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Li-Fang", "Initials": "LF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32281336", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200104.106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
