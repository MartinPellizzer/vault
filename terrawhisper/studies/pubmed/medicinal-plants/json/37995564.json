Although five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for treating several cancers, only one of them is a Class I HDAC inhibitor, which may have advantages over pan-HDAC inhibitors due to the various side effects associated with the latter. On the other hand, the emerging strategy of molecular glue degraders offers a unique advantage for targeting therapeutic proteins. In this study, we synthesized a series of candidate compounds based on the molecule glue, pomalidomide, using a \"merger principle\", initially aiming to obtain molecular glue degraders that can target HDAC degradation. However, we serendipitously discovered that compounds 2f and 3f may be potent Class I HDAC selective inhibitors. After further evaluation, we found that compounds 2f and 3f exhibit selective inhibitory effects on Class I HDAC in cancer cells. Moreover, they showed the robust antiproliferative activities against various hematological tumor cells, comparable to that of the approved Class I HDAC inhibitor, Chidamide. These results suggest that pomalidomide-derivatized compounds have promising potential as Class I HDAC inhibitors with therapeutic applications in cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
