We assessed metal-induced phytotoxicity in L. chuanxiong by exposing the plants to soil treated with Cd, Pb, or Cd/Pb mixtures. A combined Cd/Pb treatment alleviated the inhibition in plant growth, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolite generation seen in single-metal exposures in three of the four combinations. Most combined Cd/Pb treatments resulted in preferential uptake of magnesium, copper, and nitrogen in underground plant parts and accumulation of phosphorus and calcium in aboveground plant parts, thereby leading to improvements in photosynthetic potential. Compared with single-metal exposures, combined Cd/Pb treatment significantly decreased the contents of Cd by 16.67%-40.12% and Pb by 10.68%-21.70% in the plant, respectively. At the subcellular level, the Pb presence increased the Cd percentage associated with cell wall from 64.79% to 67.93% in rhizomes and from 32.76% to 45.32% in leaves, while Cd reduced Pb contents by 9.36%-46.39% in the subcellular fractions. A combined Cd/Pb treatment decreased the contents of water- and ethanol-extractable metal forms and increased the contents of acetic acid- and hydrochloric acid-extractable forms. The lower toxic effects of the Cd/Pb mixture in L. chuanxiong were associated with photosynthetic potential, subcellular distribution, the chemical forms of Cd and Pb, and synthesis of secondary metabolites. These findings are useful for plant production strategies in soils contaminated by heavy metals."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
