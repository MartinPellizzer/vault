Both extracts were extracted at 40 degrees C and afterward, one of them was boiled for 15 minutes. Thirty-three of these patients underwent oral challenges with lentils and three had a convincing recent history of lentil anaphylaxis.", "Twenty patients had a positive oral challenge; 13 were negative. Skin prick tests performed with the boiled extract at 0.5 and 5 mg/mL were positive in 96% and 100% of patients with positive food challenge, and in 31% and 85% of those with negative food challenge, respectively; positive skin test results were similar in both groups using the crude extract. Mean wheal sizes using the boiled extract at 0.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL were significantly greater in patients with a positive oral challenge than in those with a negative one (4.9, 6.8, and 7.4 mm versus 1.9, 3.5, and 5.1 mm, respectively; P < 0.05) These mean values were not statistically different using the crude extract.", "These data suggest that lentil extracts for the diagnosis of lentil hypersensitivity should be heated, since boiled extracts, used at a concentration of 0.5 or 5 mg/mL, best identify clinically sensitive individuals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Allergy Department, Hospital Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas, Madrid, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez San Ireneo", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Sand\u00edn", "ForeName": "M D", "Initials": "MD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Caldas", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mara\u00f1\u00f3n", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mu\u00f1oz Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laso Borrego", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "9503580", "ISSNLinking": "1081-1206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allergens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Allergens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11428743", "10.1016/s1081-1206(10)62299-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
