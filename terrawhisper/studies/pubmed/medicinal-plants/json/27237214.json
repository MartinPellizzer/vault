Extracts were then subjected to test antimicrobial efficacy against primary plaque colonizers and periodontal pathogens using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Mean zone of inhibition (ZOI) was measured by HI antibiotic zone scale. One-way ANOVA using Tukey's post hoc and t-test were applied for statistical analysis.", "G. glabra was found to have potential antibacterial activity against primary plaque colonizers and periodontal pathogens with highest mean ZOI measuring 9.2 \u00b1 1.09 mm and 10.6 \u00b1 0.54 mm at 24 h, respectively. F. religiosa showed antibacterial activity against primary plaque colonizers only at 48 h with mean ZOI of 2.6 \u00b1 0.54 mm. P. major showed no antibacterial activity against any of the microorganism in this study. Tukey's post hoc test showed statistically nonsignificant difference between G. glabra and standard antibiotic (vancomycin 10 mcg) for periodontal pathogens.", "G. glabra and F. religiosa showed antibacterial activity against primary plaque colonizers and periodontal pathogens.
