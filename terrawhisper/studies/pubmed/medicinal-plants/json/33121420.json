At a time of increasing cancer incidence in the world, alleviating the bothersome side effects of radiotherapy in debilitated cancer patients is becoming an important challenge.", "The aim of the study was to overview the literature data concerning the radioprotective activity of extracts, essential oils, and some chemical compounds obtained from 12 species belonging to the Lamiaceae family, gathering of numerous spice and medicinal plants rich in valuable phytochemicals.", "The analysis of available publications showed radioprotective effectiveness of essential oils and complex extracts containing phenolic acids and flavonoids in various in vitro and in vivo models. Relatively welldocumented preventive properties exhibited the following species: Mentha \u00d7 piperita, Ocimum tenuiflorum, Origanum vulgare, and Rosmarinus officinalis. However, few plants such as Lavandula angustifolia, Mentha arvensis, M. spicata, Plectranthus amboinicus, Salvia miltiorrhiza, S. officinalis, Scutellaria baicalensis, and Zataria multiflora should be more investigated in the future. Among the mechanisms of radioprotective effects of well-studied extracts and phytochemicals, it can be mentioned mainly the protection against chromosomal damage, scavenging free radicals, decreasing of lipid peroxidation and elevating of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and alkaline phosphatase enzyme levels as well as the reduction of the cell death. The plant substances protected the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow and lung fibroblasts.", "The studied species of Lamiaceae family and their active chemical compounds are potent in alleviating the side effects of radiotherapy and should be considered as a complementary therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chair and Department of Medical Microbiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Karpi\u0144ski", "ForeName": "Tomasz M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Breeding and Agricultural Technology of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants - National Research Institute, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Adamczak", "ForeName": "Artur", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants - National Research Institute, Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "O\u017carowski", "ForeName": "Marcin", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation, Ionizing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33121420", "10.2174/1871520620666201029120147", "ACAMC-EPUB-111012"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
