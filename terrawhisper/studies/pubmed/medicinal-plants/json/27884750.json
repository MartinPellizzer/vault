We designed an experimental study first to investigate the serum level of lactate as a biomarker of MS progression and also to investigate the effect of methylprednisolone on serum lactate.", "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was inducted in Lewis rats, and then rats were treated intraperitoneally with methylprednisolone (30mg/kg/d), at the disease onset, and the clinical scores were recorded. After seven days of treatment, the serum levels of lactate were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Moreover, lymphocyte infiltration and the demyelinated area was analysed in spinal cord.", "Compared to the untreated-EAE rats, methylprednisolone remarkably improved the clinical score of EAE and ameliorated the spinal cord inflammation and demyelination. In addition, the marked decline in IFN-\u03b3 and the increase in IL-4 confirmed improvement in the rats treated with methylprednisolone. Measurement of lactate using HPLC indicated enhancement in the serum level of lactate in the untreated-EAE rats; the lactate level significantly decreased after methylprednisolone therapy. Moreover, serum lactates and disease severity were correlated positively and significantly.", "These data confirmed for the first time, that methylprednisolone can decreases the enhanced level of serum lactate in EAE model. In addition, it was shown that measurement of serum lactate could be an inexpensive and accurate laboratory test to determine the response to treatment and to assess disease severity in MS patients."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
