Several diseases, including malignancy, have been associated with lncRNA dysregulation. Due to their functions in cancer development and progression, lncRNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Several studies have investigated the anti-cancer properties of lncRNAs; however, only a few lncRNAs have been found to exhibit tumor suppressor properties. Furthermore, their length and poor stability make them difficult to synthesize. Thus, to overcome the instability of lncRNAs, poor specificity, and their off-target effects, researchers have constructed nanocarriers that encapsulate lncRNAs. Recently, translational medicine research has focused on delivering lncRNAs into tumor cells, including cancer cells, through nano-drug delivery systems <i>in vivo</i>. The developed nanocarriers can protect, target, and release lncRNAs under controlled conditions without appreciable adverse effects. To deliver lncRNAs to cancer cells, various nanocarriers, such as exosomes, microbubbles, polymer nanoparticles, 1,2-dioleyl-3-trimethylammoniumpropane chloride nanocarriers, and virus-like particles, have been successfully developed. Despite this, every nanocarrier has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to delivering nucleic acids effectively and safely. This article examines the current status of nanocarriers for lncRNA delivery in cancer therapy, focusing on their potential to enhance cancer treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Science, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran. davodabadii.fateme@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Davodabadi", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute of Cellular and Molecular Sciences in Infectious Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. shokufemn@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Mirinejad", "ForeName": "Shekoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Amity Institute of Biotechnology, Amity University Jharkhand, Ranchi-834002, India. smalik@rnc.amity.edu."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Sumira", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Himalayan School of Biosciences, Swami Rama Himalayan University, Jolly Grant, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, 248140, India. dhasmana15bio@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Dhasmana", "ForeName": "Archna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biochemistry, Institute of Health Sciences, Ege University, \u0130zmir 35100, Turkey. ulucanfulden@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Ulucan-Karnak", "ForeName": "Fulden", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute of Cellular and Molecular Sciences in Infectious Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. shokufemn@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sargazi", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2255-5977"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Research Institute of Cellular and Molecular Sciences in Infectious Diseases, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran. shokufemn@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sargazi", "ForeName": "Saman", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1712-9367"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, 94531-55166, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Sciences and Technologies in Medicine, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd 9414974877, Iran.
