Regression model equations were developed to predict the trace elements concentration in lemongrass plant parts. Model efficiency values ranged between 0.53 and 0.85 for roots and 0.50 to 0.77 for shoots. R<sup>2</sup> for all the equations was high and ranged between 0.52 and 0.95 for roots and 0.50 to 0.91 for shoots. Path analysis coefficients revealed the status of interdependence between soil properties and heavy metal concentrations in plant tissues and their translocation pattern in the same. TF\u00a0>\u00a01 for Ni and Pb was recorded in all test varieties at different tannery sludge concentrations in soil and for Cd in Suwarna variety grown in sole TS. BAF>1 and BAC>1 for Ni and Pb was observed for all test varieties. BCF>1 for Cr was found in Suwarna variety at sole tannery sludge. It can be concluded that lemongrass can accumulate lead and nickel in its harvestable plant parts. Hence, it can act as a suitable phytoextractor for the same metals. Range of essential oil content (percentage) varied in all test varieties i.e. Shikhar (1.04-1.29), Krishna (0.94-1.05), Suwarna (0.82-0.95) and Chirharit (0.87-1.06) at different tannery sludge concentrations. Moreover, heavy metal content in the essential oil of all test varieties was found to be within the permissible limits, hence cultivation of lemongrass can be recommended at metal contaminated sites with minimum risk of food chain contamination."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
