Plants were regenerated through callus culture from leaf and nodal segments. Highest callusing was obtained from leaf explants in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 0.8% bacto agar and 2 mg/L NAA + 0.5 mg/L BA. Shoot formation frequency was maximum (83%) with BA at 1.0 mg/L. Regenerated plantlets were rooted on MS medium with auxins. Maximum (90%) rooting was obtained using 0.5 mg/L NAA. Plantlets were grown for 4 weeks in this medium and then transferred to pots containing sterile sand in a moisture saturated glass chamber under laboratory conditions. The established plants were grown in pots filled with a mixture of sand\u2236soil\u2236manure (2\u22361\u22361) under natural daylight conditions in the field. The total leaf yield was increased in the tissue culture derived plants. These plants were dwarf and had higher specific leaf weight (leaf thickness) and leaf area compared to control plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aromatic and Medicinal Plants Division, Regional Research Laboratory (CSIR), 751013, Bhubaneswar, India."}], "LastName": "Misra", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "9880970", "ISSNLinking": "0721-7714"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "J Nat Prod. 1994 May;57(5):557-73", "ArticleIdList": ["8064290"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "8", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24178289", "10.1007/BF00231602"]}}]}
