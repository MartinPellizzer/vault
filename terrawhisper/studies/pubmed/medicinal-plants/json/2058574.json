In 1971 the baseline population consisted of 175 normoglycemic subjects. During the follow-up period (1972-1975) an oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out annually. In univariate analyses, baseline BMI and the habitual intake of carbohydrates and pastries, as determined from a cross-check dietary history, were positively associated with the incidence of glucose intolerance. The habitual intake of legumes was inversely related to the incidence of glucose intolerance. These results could not be explained by potential confounding factors such as age, gender, alcohol use, energy intake, prescribed diet, medication use, and comorbidity. These results suggest that energy balance and the use of carbohydrate-rich foods are related to the development of glucose intolerance in an elderly population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology, National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Feskens", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bowles", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kromhout", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Mass Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Intake"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose Tolerance Test"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Incidence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2058574", "10.1093/ajcn/54.1.136"]}}]}
