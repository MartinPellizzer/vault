These magnetic fields are caused by ionic currents that appear after injury in different parts of the plant. All measured V. faba plants responded to the burning stimulation with detectable quasi-d.c. magnetic signals. In order to measure these signals, a suitable modulation had to be used. The covariance method was applied to analyse the measured data. The results demonstrate a dipolar-like magnetic signal, exponentially decreasing in time, above the cutting type of injury. After the burning stimulation, the magnetically detected activity was concentrated predominantly above the leaves/petioles and less above the stem. Possible mechanisms for this behaviour are suggested. A comparison with previously known electrical measurements of plant injury is given."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Physics Department IMFM, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. vojko@fiz.uni-lj.si"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jazbinsek", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Thiel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "W\u00fcbbeler", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Trontelj", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Eur Biophys J", "NlmUniqueID": "8409413", "ISSNLinking": "0175-7571"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Stimulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11156293", "10.1007/s002490000105"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
