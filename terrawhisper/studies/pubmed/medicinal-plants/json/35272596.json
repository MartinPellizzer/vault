Due to the availability of a variety of regimes, their management remains a dynamical challenge for the entire medical and paramedical community. Indeed, skin burn injuries are accompanied by a series of several devastating events that lead to sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Hence, the challenge lies in the development of a better understanding as well as clear diagnostic criteria and predictive biomarkers, which are important in their management. Though there are several regimes available in the market, there are still numerous limitations and challenges in the management. In this review article, we have discussed the various biomarkers that could be targeted for managing skin burn injuries. Instead of focusing on allopathic medication that has its adverse events per se, we have discussed the history, ethnopharmacology properties, and prospects of identified phytomedicines from a well-established herbal informatics model. This review article not only discusses the benefits of scrutinized phytocompounds but also the development of novel druggable phyto-compounds to target skin burn injury at a lower cost with no adverse effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of CBRN Defence, Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, New Delhi 110054, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Deepti", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Center, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Haryana, 121001, India."}], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "Sapna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Life Science and Biotechnology, South Asian University, New Delhi 110021, India."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Amit Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, 10461, USA."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Ruby", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, NY, 10461, USA."}], "LastName": "Tanwar", "ForeName": "Ankit", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Burns"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Organ Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35272596", "10.2174/1389201023666220310141308", "CPB-EPUB-121503"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
