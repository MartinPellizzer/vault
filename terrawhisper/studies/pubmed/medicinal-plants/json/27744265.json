Makino is a perennial medicinal herb widely distributed in China. This herb contains important medicinal components called gypenosides, which belong to dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins. Squalene epoxidase (SE, EC 1.14.99.7) catalyzes the epoxidation of squalene to form oxidosqualene and is a key regulatory enzyme in triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis. In this study, a SE gene designated as GpSE1 was isolated from G.\u00a0pentaphyllum leaves. The deduced protein sequence of GpSE1 contained two conserved domains involved in the catalytic function of SE. GpSE1 was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli cells, and the HIS-tagged recombinant protein was successfully purified and renatured in\u00a0vitro. Immunofluorescence indicated that the polygonal reticular fluorescence signal of GpSE1 was significantly stronger in young leaves than in mature leaves and rhizomes. This finding is consistent with the tissue-specific expression pattern of GpSE1 and suggests that the young leaves of G.\u00a0pentaphyllum mainly serve as the active site of gypenoside synthesis. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment upregulated GpSE1 expression in both the young and mature leaves of G.\u00a0pentaphyllum, with greater upregulation in young leaves than in mature leaves. However, the expression of GpSE1 was not enhanced continually with the increase in MeJA concentration. Moreover, the GpSE1 expression was maximally regulated in response to 50\u00a0\u03bcM MeJA but not to 100\u00a0\u03bcM MeJA. This result indicates that MeJA exerts a concentration-dependent effect on GpSE1 expression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
