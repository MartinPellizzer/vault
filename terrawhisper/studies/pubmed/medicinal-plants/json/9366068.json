Prior to the feeding trial, one group of piglets was creep-fed and the other noncreep-fed. The two groups of piglets were weaned at 28 days and randomly assigned to four different diets, the main protein sources of which were: T1--skimmed milk power (control); T2--31% soybean meal (high SBM), T3--15% soybean meal and 12% skimmed milk powder (low SBM), and T4--100% raw cowpea meal. Live weight gain was highest in the control group, and least in cowpea-fed piglets. At weaning, only the noncreep-fed weaners showed villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia but at 7 days postweaning, these changes were evident in all groups except the control and were more severe in the noncreep SBM and cowpea-fed groups. At 21 days postweaning, only noncreep cowpea-fed pigs showed a reduced villus height when compared to the control group. A mild diarrhoea was generally observed in all noncreep-fed weaners, but its onset was more rapid (P < 0.01) and the duration much longer (P < 0.05) in the high SBM and cowpea-fed pigs than in low SBM and control groups. A lower faecal pH was observed in weaners that had diarrhoea when compared with a pH of 7.1 in pigs with normal faecal moisture. The observations of enteropathology and low growth performance in the cowpea group suggest that feeding raw cowpea to weaners may induce antigenicity in the intestinal mucosa, causing damage and a consequent decrease in productivity. However, the introduction of creep feeding before weaning appears to have some ameliorative effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Preclinical Veterinary Studies, University of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe."}], "LastName": "Makinde", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Umapathy", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Akingbemi", "ForeName": "B T", "Initials": "BT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mandisodza", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Skadhauge", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Comp Biochem Physiol A Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9516062", "ISSNLinking": "1096-4940"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weight Gain"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9366068", "10.1016/s0300-9629(96)00317-9"]}}]}
