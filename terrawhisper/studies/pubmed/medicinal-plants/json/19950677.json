The two herbs were digested by applying acid bomb digestion procedure. Considering RF power, nebulized gas flow rate, auxiliary gas flow rate and pump rate, the instrument was optimized. The instrument operating conditions, analytical lines and detection limits of elements determined as well as the contents of elements in these two herbs were reported. The results show that Sophora tonkinensis contains microelements Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and Cr and macroelements Ca, Mg, Na and K; Flemingiae philippinensis contains microelements Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, Mn and Cr and macroelements Ca, Mg, Na and K. However, the two traditional Chinese medicines do not contain toxic elements Sn, Pb and Cd. The precision was found to be less than 5% in terms of relative standard deviation mostly. The results indicate that the concentration ratio of zinc to copper in Sophora tonkinensis is 6.4, while the ratio in Flemingiae philippinensis is 5.7. The content of zinc is higher than copper in both two herbs, which agrees with the phenomenon that the zinc content higher than that of copper exists in other antitumor traditional Chinese medicine. All these will afford an apocalypse for understanding the pharmacological mechanism of these anitumor traditional Chinese medicines."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for the Chemistry and Molecular Engineering of Medicinal Resources(Ministry of Education), School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin 541004, China. maolinc_8011@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mao", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "Ming-xiong", "Initials": "MX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhen-feng", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Guang Pu Xue Yu Guang Pu Fen Xi", "NlmUniqueID": "9424805", "ISSNLinking": "1000-0593"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19950677"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
