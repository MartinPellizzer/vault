Subjects were randomly allocated into two groups (30 subjects each group) to receive either 1000mg omega-3 fatty acids from flaxseed oil supplements or placebo twice a day for 12weeks.", "After the 12-week intervention, compared with the placebo, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation resulted in significant decreases in ulcer length (-2.0\u00b12.3 vs. -1.0\u00b11.1cm, P=0.03), width (-1.8\u00b11.7 vs. -1.0\u00b11.0cm, P=0.02) and depth (-0.8\u00b10.6 vs. -0.5\u00b10.5cm, P=0.01). Additionally, significant reductions in serum insulin concentrations (-4.4\u00b15.5 vs. +1.4\u00b18.3 \u03bcIU/mL, P=0.002), homeostasis model of assessment-estimated insulin resistance (-2.1\u00b13.0 vs. +1.0\u00b15.0, P=0.005) and HbA1c (-0.9\u00b11.5 vs. -0.1\u00b10.4%, P=0.01), and a significant rise in the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.01\u00b10.01 vs. -0.005\u00b10.02, P=0.002) were seen following supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids compared with the placebo. In addition, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation significantly decreased serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-25.5\u00b131.5 vs. -8.2\u00b118.9\u03bcg/mL, P=0.01), and significantly increased plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (+83.5\u00b1111.7 vs. -73.4\u00b1195.5mmol/L, P<0.001) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations (+60.7\u00b1140.2 vs. -15.5\u00b1129.7\u03bcmol/L, P=0.03) compared with the placebo.", "Overall, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation for 12weeks among subjects with DFU had beneficial effects on parameters of ulcer size, markers of insulin metabolism, serum hs-CRP, plasma TAC and GSH levels. In addition, flaxseed oil omega-3 fatty acids may have played an indirect role in wound healing due to its effects on improved metabolic profiles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.
