Due to nucleophilicity of nucleobases, RNA molecules can react with electrophilic species thus to be \"adducted\". The electron-deficient agents potentially inducing adduction exist in a variety of natural sources including metabolic products of biomolecules. Although evident and readily detected in human tissue, RNA adduction remains poorly understood for their physiological and pathological function. In this article, we review a collection of exogenous and endogenous molecular species that participate in RNA adduction and elaborates on the chemical nature of their RNA adduction sites. Furthermore, we provide perspectives on the potential of RNA adducts as biomarkers of environmental insults. Finally, we project future investigations that are necessary for understanding the mechanisms of cellular toxicity of RNA adduction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
