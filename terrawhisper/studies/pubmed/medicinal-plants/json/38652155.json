Harvesting plant material from natural environments, however, has led to species scarcity, prompting action to develop cultivation solutions that also aid conservation efforts. Biotechnological tools, specifically plant tissue culture and genetic transformation, offer solutions for sustainable, large-scale production and enhanced yield of valuable biomolecules. While these techniques are instrumental to the development of the medicinal plant industry, the challenge of inherent regeneration recalcitrance in some species to in vitro cultivation hampers these efforts. This review examines the strategies for overcoming recalcitrance in medicinal plants using a holistic approach, emphasising the meticulous choice of explants, e.g. embryonic/meristematic tissues; plant growth regulators, e.g. synthetic cytokinins; and use of novel regeneration-enabling methods to deliver morphogenic genes e.g. GRF/GIF chimeras and nanoparticles, which have been shown to contribute to overcoming recalcitrance barriers in agriculture crops. Furthermore, it highlights the benefit of cost-effective genomic technologies that enable precise genome editing and the value of integrating data-driven models to address genotype-specific challenges in medicinal plant research. These advances mark a progressive step towards a future where medicinal plant cultivation is not only more efficient and predictable but also inherently sustainable, ensuring the continued availability and exploitation of these important plants for current and future generations."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
