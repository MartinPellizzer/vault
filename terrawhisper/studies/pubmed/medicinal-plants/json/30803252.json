The aim of this study was to investigate transferability of plasmid bearing <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and to use whole-genome sequencing in order to understand the genetic context of plasmid. <i>K. pneumoniae</i> strain was used as donor in conjugation experiments. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of selected transconjugant was determined. Plasmid was isolated from transconjugant colony and was named as pKPT. Complete sequencing of the pKPT was conducted using a next-generation sequencing. Annotation of the contigs was performed using the Geneious R9, followed by finding open reading frames (ORFs) with selected web-based tools. BLAST analysis was performed at the NCBI BLAST server to determine genes showing more than 90% similarity with these ORFs. Results of antibiotic susceptibility test showed that transconjugant colony was resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The pKPT plasmid had a length of 45,217\u00a0bp and an average G\u2009+\u2009C content of 49%. Blast analysis revealed that pKPT was included in the IncL/M incompatibility group. The pKPT was found to contain <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-48</sub> within Tn<i>1999.2</i> transposon without any other antibiotic resistance gene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 Department of Genetics and Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane University , G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Medicinal Plants, Traditional Medicine Practice and Research Center, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane University , G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, Turkey."}], "LastName": "D\u00fczg\u00fcn", "ForeName": "Azer \u00d6zad", "Initials": "A\u00d6"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Health Sciences, Artvin Coruh University , Artvin, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Saral", "ForeName": "Ay\u015feg\u00fcl", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Microbiol Immunol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "9434021", "ISSNLinking": "1217-8950"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbapenems"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.2.6", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Lactamases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Typing Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Carbapenems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conjugation, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Klebsiella pneumoniae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Multilocus Sequence Typing"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Lactamases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30803252", "10.1556/030.66.2019.010"]}}]}
