At present, most drugs for AD on the market are single-target drugs, which have achieved certain success in the treatment of AD. However, the efficacy and safety of single-target drugs have not achieved the expected results because AD is a multifactorial disease. Multi-targeted drugs act on multiple factors of the disease network to improve efficacy and reduce adverse reactions. Therefore, the search for effective dual-target or even multi-target drugs has become a new research trend. Many of results found that the dual-target inhibitors of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) found from traditional Chinese medicine have a good inhibitory effect on AD with fewer side effects. This article reviews sixty-six compounds extracted from Chinese medicinal herbs, which have inhibitory activity on BACE1 and AChE. This provides a theoretical basis for the further development of these compounds as dual-target inhibitors for the treatment of AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
