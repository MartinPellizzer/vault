N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a medication that has a beneficial role in reducing the intoxication of kidneys caused by PQ. Niosomes are bilayer vesicles that enhance the bioavailability of drugs. This study aimed to compare the effects of NAC and niosome of NAC (NACNPs) on PQ-induced kidney toxicity concerning its antioxidant activity.", "In this experimental study, after formulating NACNP, 30 Wistar male rats weighing 180 to 250 gm were classified into five groups: the control group was treated with normal saline, while the other four groups received 35mg/kg/day of PQ via intraperitoneal route and, was treated with 25mg/kg/day NAC, 25mg/kg/day niosome and 25 mg/kg/day NACNP by gavage, Then, oxidative stress biomarkers such as total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase activity (CAT), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and total thiol group (TTG), plus blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were evaluated in kidney tissue homogenate and examined histopathologically.", "The results revealed that TTG increased significantly in NAC & NACNP groups than in the PQ group. Further, in the PQ group, LPO increased significantly compared with the control, NAC, and NACNP groups, while in the NAC and NACNP group, LPO diminished compared with the PQ group. There was no significant difference in TAC between groups. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels dropped in NACNP compared with the PQ group and the NAC. Histological studies also approved PQ-induced damage and the protective effect of NACNP.", "The results indicated that NACNP could modulate oxidative stress status and kidney function against PQ toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Science, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jouzdani", "ForeName": "Ali Fathi", "Initials": "AF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Hamadan University of Medical Science, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ganjirad", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Hamadan University of Medical Science, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Firozian", "ForeName": "Farzin", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleimani-Asl", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ranjbar", "ForeName": "Akram", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101623431", "ISSNLinking": "2211-7385"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PLG39H7695", "NameOfSubstance": "Paraquat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WYQ7N0BPYC", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Paraquat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35156589", "10.2174/2211738510666220214102034", "PNT-EPUB-120854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
