{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["The Community Development Association of the fishing village of Barra del Colorado populated by Blacks embraced the Conservation Strategy for the Sustainable Development of the Plains Tortuguero covering 419,000 hectares of lowland rain forest and wetlands along the Caribbean cost of northern Costa Rica. In 1985 the government established the Barra del Colorado Wildlife Refuge. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) team visited families and identified community problems. This resulted in the establishment of a communal bank; a community fisherman's association to help obtain a boat and fishing gear; assistance to help villagers obtain title to their land; a feasibility study of a public transport link to the rest of the country; new chairs for the school; and weekly instead of monthly visits by a doctor. The Tortuguero Strategy endeavors to establish 147,000 hectares of conservation area including the Tortuguero National Park. 5000 people live in the buffer zone and 132,000 live in the neighboring western area. The strategy strives to reverse deforestation in the buffer zone by restoring forest cover to 80% of the area by 2000. The Strategy has funded the Union of Small Agricultural Producers of the Atlantic to train people in ecotourism, forestry management, and growing and selling medicinal plants. The IUCN evaluated the environmental impact of expanding banana plantations and recommended ameliorative steps which have not been implemented. The preparation of the Tortuguero Strategy started in 1990 in concert with the Natural Resources Ministry, IUCN, and the European Community. A 1992 draft document based on biophysical, socioeconomic, and legal studies is waiting for official approval. Community strategies have been launched in 2 communities, self-sustaining financing is delayed, and a draft law setting up the conservation area awaits Costa Rican legislative authorization. The strategy is for the long term, but the experience of Barra del Colorado has shown that participatory problem-solving for local initiatives can help gain community support."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["092103", "00228983"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: PEOPLE AND THE PLANET"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Central America", "Community Development", "Community Participation", "Costa Rica", "Developing Countries", "Development Plans", "Economic Factors", "Environment", "Environmental Protection", "Forests", "International Agencies", "International Cooperation", "Latin America", "Natural Resources", "North America", "Organization And Administration", "Organizations", "Social Development"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12287333", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1994", "Month": "08", "Day": "03"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0968-1655", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "2", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1993"}}, "Title": "People & the planet", "ISOAbbreviation": "People Planet"}, "ArticleTitle": "Sustaining life in frontier land.
