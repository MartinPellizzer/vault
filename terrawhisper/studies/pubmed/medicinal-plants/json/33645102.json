The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS~E) was used to profile the chemical compositions and analyze the similarities and differences of G. longipes samples in these areas. Based on the accurate molecular weight and fragment information obtained from Q-TOF-MS~E, the structures of the main components were identified by combining with the mass spectra, chromatographic behaviors of reference standards and related literatures. The results showed that the components of wild G. longipes from different places among Qinling-Daba Mountains area were similar. Forty-five chemical components were identified in the whole plant of G. longipes from Pingli, Shaanxi Province, including 43 triterpenoid saponins and 2 flavonoids which contain all main peaks in its fingerprint. The main components are dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins, such asgypenoside \u2169L\u2168, gypenoside A and its malonylated product of glycosyl."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Tianjin 301617,China Institute of Radiation Medicine,Academy of Military Medical Sciences,Academy of Military Sciences Beijing 100850,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meng-Meng", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Radiation Medicine,Academy of Military Medical Sciences,Academy of Military Sciences Beijing 100850,China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Radiation Medicine,Academy of Military Medical Sciences,Academy of Military Sciences Beijing 100850,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Tianjin 301617,China Institute of Radiation Medicine,Academy of Military Medical Sciences,Academy of Military Sciences Beijing 100850,China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control Xi'an 710065,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xue-Feng", "Initials": "XF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Institute for Food and Drug Control Xi'an 710065,China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Ding-Qiang", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development,Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College Beijing 100193,China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Bao-Lin", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Tianjin 301617,China Institute of Radiation Medicine,Academy of Military Medical Sciences,Academy of Military Sciences Beijing 100850,China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Bai-Ping", "Initials": "BP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gynostemma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33645102", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200623.204"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
