Nearly 400 million people are affected every year, which approximately costs 500 million dollars for surveillance and vector control itself. Many investigations on the structure-function relationship of proteins expressed by the dengue virus are being made for more than a decade and had come up with many reports on small molecule drug discovery. In this review, we present a detailed note on viral proteins and their functions as well as the inhibitors discovered/designed so far using experimental and computational methods. Further, the phytoconstituents from medicinal plants, specifically the extract of the papaya leaves, neem and bael, which combat dengue infection via dengue protease, helicase, methyl transferase and polymerase are summarized."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, Vinayaka Mission's Kirupananda Variyar Engineering College, Vinayaka Mission's Research Foundation (Deemed to be University), Salem - 636308, India."}], "LastName": "Shanmugam", "ForeName": "Anusuya", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai - 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Ramakrishnan", "ForeName": "Chandrasekaran", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of Advanced Study in Crystallography and Biophysics, University of Madras, Guindy Campus, Chennai - 600025, India."}], "LastName": "Velmurugan", "ForeName": "Devadasan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, Bhupat and Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai - 600036, India."}], "LastName": "Gromiha", "ForeName": "M Michael", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Dengue"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dengue Virus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32552652", "10.2174/1568026620666200618123026", "CTMC-EPUB-107443"]}}]}
