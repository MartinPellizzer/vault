Internal amino acid sequences of the purified enzyme from spearmint oil glands were utilized to design three distinct oligonucleotide probes. These probes were subsequently employed to screen a spearmint leaf cDNA library, and four clones were isolated. Three of these cDNA isolates were full-length and were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a peptide that is immunologically recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified limonene synthase from spearmint and that is catalytically active in generating from geranyl pyrophosphate a product distribution identical to that of the native enzyme (principally limonene with small amounts of the coproducts alpha- and beta-pinene and myrcene). The longest open reading frame is 1800 nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative plastidial transit peptide of approximately 90 amino acids and a mature protein of about 510 residues corresponding to the native enzyme. Several nucleotide differences in the 5'-untranslated region of all three full-length clones suggest the presence of several limonene synthase genes and/or alleles in the allotetraploid spearmint genome. Sequence comparisons with a sesquiterpene cyclase, epi-aristolochene synthase from tobacco, and a diterpene cyclase, casbene synthase from castor bean, demonstrated a significant degree of similarity between these three terpenoid cyclase types, the first three examples of this large family of catalysts to be described from higher plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6340."}], "LastName": "Colby", "ForeName": "S M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alonso", "ForeName": "W R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Katahira", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McGarvey", "ForeName": "D J", "Initials": "DJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Croteau", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["L13459"]}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM-31354", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.5.-", "NameOfSubstance": "pinene cyclase I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8226816", "S0021-9258(19)49419-2"]}}]}
