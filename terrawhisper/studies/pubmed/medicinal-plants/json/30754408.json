In December of 2006, a new foliar disease caused by Corynespora cassiicola was observed on balsam pear growing in greenhouses in Shouguang City, Shandong Province, China. The disease occurred on 35% or less of the plants. Leaves of affected plants developed off-white halos surrounding circular lesions that were 1 to 5 mm broad. The lesions became dark brown, necrotic with concentric rings, and up to 15 mm in diameter. Severely affected plants eventually wilted and defoliated. Pieces of tissue from the leading edges of lesions were disinfected in 1% NaOCl for 1 min, rinsed in sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar. Colonies of the fungus were gray to dark green. Conidiophores were erect and simple, pale brown to brown, and 100 to 450 \u03bcm long and 3 to 8 \u03bcm wide. Conidia were obclavate to cylindrical, pale olivaceous brown to dark brown, smooth, 35 to 100 \u00d7 8 to 12 \u03bcm, and were produced in chains. On the basis of these characteristics, the fungus was identified as Corynespora cassiicola (1). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. GQ381292). It was an exact match for a sequence of C. cassiicola previously deposited (Accession No. EU364555). To confirm pathogenicity, 30 1-month-old healthy seedlings of balsam pear were inoculated by spraying a suspension of conidia (1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> conidia per ml) of one isolate of C. cassiicola until runoff. Ten seedlings were sprayed with sterile water as controls. Plants were kept in a humidity chamber at 27\u00b0C overnight and then placed in a growth chamber at 27\u00b0C. After 7 days, symptoms identical to those described above were observed, while no symptoms developed on the control plants. The pathogen was reisolated from inoculated leaves. C. cassiicola causes foliar diseases on many plants, including tomato, eggplant, soybean, and cucumber (2). There is one report on balsam pear in Korea (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of target leaf spot caused by C. cassiicola on balsam pear in China. References: (1) M. B. Ellis. CMI Mycol. Pap. No. 65, 1957. (2) M. B. Ellis et al.
