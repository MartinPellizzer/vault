Renal damage was confirmed by the increased production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS).", "Co-treatment with SK to urolithiatic rats for 21 days significantly prevented the elevation of renal and urinary stone biomarkers in plasma and renal tissue thereby preventing renal damage and the formation of renal calculi. Administration of SK at all doses and cystone restored the antioxidant (glutathione) levels by preventing the elevation of TBARS in the kidney tissue, which was further confirmed by histological sections.", "SK treatment promotes diuresis which leads to flushing of the renal stones and maintains the alkaline environment in the urinary system which probably mediates the antilithiatic activity. SK provides structural and functional protection to the kidneys by enhancing its physiological function against stone formation and validates its clinical use.", "SK exhibited antilithiatic and diuretic potential in ethylene glycol and sodium oxalate induced urolithiasis in ratsElevated urinary stone markers (Calcium, oxalate, uric acid, magnesium and phosphates) in plasma and renal tubular enzymes (LDH, GGT, ALP, AST ALT) in urolithiatic rats were reversed by SK treatmentSK administration significantly reduced the level of renal stress markers like Urea, Creatinine, LPO and elevated SOD, GPx, GSH levels aiding in nephroprotectionSK also provides structural and functional protection against ethylene glycol- induced renal calculus in rats as evidenced by histopathological studies. <b>Abbreviations used:</b> SK: <i>Sirupeelai Samoola Kudineer</i>; TBARS: ThioBarbituric Acid Reactive Substances; SOD: SuperOxide Dismutase; GPx: Gluthathione peroxidase; GSH- Glutathione; LPO: Lipid peroxidation as measured as TBARS; AST: Aspartate AminoTransferase; ALT: Alanine Amino transferase; GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transferase; LDH: Lactate Dehydrogenase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Herbal and Indian Medicine Research Laboratory, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Vasanthi", "ForeName": "A Hannah Rachel", "Initials": "AHR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Herbal and Indian Medicine Research Laboratory, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Muthulakshmi", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Herbal and Indian Medicine Research Laboratory, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Gayathri", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Herbal and Indian Medicine Research Laboratory, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Manikandan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Herbal and Indian Medicine Research Laboratory, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Ananthi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, Sri Ramachandra University, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India."}], "LastName": "Kuruvilla", "ForeName": "Sarah", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacogn Mag", "NlmUniqueID": "101300403", "ISSNLinking": "0973-1296"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Knoll T.
