In Theung district, Chiang Rai province, members of the local support group for people with HIV produce their own, low-cost, herbal medicines. Although the herbal medicines they produce do not provide a cure for HIV/AIDS, they do offer relief for some of the symptoms of opportunistic infections. The herbs are prepared by the group members under the supervision of the pharmacy department at the district hospital. Local people judge their effectiveness by hearing testimonials from people who have witnessed improvement in symptoms. In response to the popularity and effectiveness of herbal medicines, the Ministry of Public Health has approved plans to sell products derived from local herbs in the pharmacies of government hospitals."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Asia", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Health", "Health Services", "Hiv Infections", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional--beneficial effects", "Plants, Medicinal--beneficial effects", "Progress Report", "Southeastern Asia", "Thailand", "Viral Diseases"]], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AIDS ACTION"], "PMID": "12296175", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "2000", "Month": "12", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "04"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0953-0096", "JournalIssue": {"Issue": "46", "PubDate": {"Year": "1999", "Season": "Oct-Dec"}}, "Title": "AIDS action", "ISOAbbreviation": "AIDS Action"}, "ArticleTitle": "Marketing herbal medicines.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "MedlinePgn": "6"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lazarus", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "AIDS Action", "NlmUniqueID": "8900887", "ISSNLinking": "0953-0096"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Program Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virus Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12296175"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
