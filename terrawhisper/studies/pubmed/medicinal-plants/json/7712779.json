This power struggle threatens to jeopardize Tuareg women's traditionally high status, prestige, and independence expressed, for example, in ownership of herds and participation in trade, the right to eject husbands from the tent, and self-representation in litigation. To protect their autonomy, Tuareg women are reluctant to acknowledge their illnesses--especially those related to reproduction. Although women desire medicines and treatments for infertility, they fear the power and mistrust the motives of the male medical specialists. State health facilities are associated with the earlier French colonial presence, and important interventions such as immunization and oral rehydration are viewed as attempts at political manipulation. Thus, care is taken to ensure that no one health practitioner accumulates too much power. During pregnancy and childbirth, for example, women may utilize the services of female herbalists, the hospital, and exorcists. Current state policies favor sedentarization and patrifocal residence, causing divisions between Tuareg men and women; at other times, ethnic-based solidarity takes precedence. Essential to an understanding of medicine in this traditional community is a political-cultural anthropological analysis of the dialectical interplay between the female body, power, and resistance."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["105647", "00242011"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: CULTURE, MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Anthropology", "Anthropology, Cultural", "Culture", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Economic Factors", "French Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Services", "Interdisciplinary Studies", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Niger", "Plants, Medicinal", "Political Factors", "Power", "Reproductive Health", "Social Sciences", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Western Africa", "Women's Status"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "7712779", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "05", "Day": "15"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "31"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0165-005X", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "18", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1994", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "Culture, medicine and psychiatry", "ISOAbbreviation": "Cult Med Psychiatry"}, "ArticleTitle": "Female sexuality, social reproduction, and the politics of medical intervention in Niger: Kel Ewey Tuareg perspectives.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "433", "EndPage": "462", "MedlinePgn": "433-62"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["This essay explores connections between political institutions, forms of power, and women's health care concerns from a cultural anthropological perspective.
