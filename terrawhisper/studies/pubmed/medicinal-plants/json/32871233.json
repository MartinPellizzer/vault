Moreover, they ameliorated the Na+/K\u00a0+\u00a0ATPase pump, the L-type Ca<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> channel current, and the intracellular ATP. They also reduced cardiac remodeling and myocardial cell apoptosis through degradation of caspase-3, Bax, P53 protein, enhancement of Bcl-2 protein expression as well as downregulation of TGF\u03b21 and TNF\u03b1 expression.
