The crude polysaccharide has been fractionated by acidic ethanol. Three fractions (SJ1, SJ2, SJ3) were got respectively. SJ2 deproteinizationed by the combined methods of enzyme and Seveage, purified by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 gel filtration. PC analysis indicated that SJ22 is composed of Xyl,Ara,Glc,Gal,GaL A. The identification of purify by Sepharose CL-4B, paper chromatography and cellulous acetate electrophoresis showed it was homogeneous. Typical absorption of polysaccharides was shown in its IR spectrum. It contained a-glucosidic bonds by IR analysis. It had typical absorption of protein by UV scaning. SJ22 is first isolated from Leave in Hippohae rhamnoides L Scavenging free radical experiment showed that SJ22 was effective in scavenging superoxideradical and hydroxylradical, but only a little effective in scavenging lipid radical."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Science, Central University for Nationalitites, Beijing 100081, China.
