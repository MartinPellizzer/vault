In this context, researchers have developed a wide range of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) for the improvement of growth and productivity by modulating the metabolic pathways in plants. This class of tailor-made materials can potentially lead to the development of a new group of agrochemical nanofertilizers. However, there are reports that engineered nanomaterials could impart phytotoxicity to edible and medicinal plants. On the contrary, there is a series of ENMs that might be detrimental when applied directly and/or indirectly to the plants. These particles can sometimes readily aggregate and dissolute in the immediate vicinity; the free ions released from the nanomatrix can cause serious tissue injury and membrane dysfunction to the plant cell through oxidative stress. On that note, thorough studies on uptake, translocation, internalization, and nutritional quality assessment must be carried out to understand ENM-plant interactions. This review critically discusses the possible beneficial or adverse aftereffect of nanofertilizers in the immediate environment to interrelate the impacts of ENMs on the crop health and food security management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3772-0047"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur , Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India."}], "LastName": "Pradhan", "ForeName": "Saheli", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3443-2461"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agricultural and Food Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur , Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India."}], "LastName": "Mailapalli", "ForeName": "Damodhara Rao", "Initials": "DR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28876911", "10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02528"]}}]}
