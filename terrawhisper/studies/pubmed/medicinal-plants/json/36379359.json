Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) has been used as a suitable solvent for several traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and is often used as an excipient for the compound preparation of SR. However, the drug-excipient interactions between BG and PEG400 are still unknown. Herein, we evaluated the effect of a single intravenous PEG400 administration on the BG levels of rats using pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies. A liver microsome and recombinant enzyme incubation system were used to further confirm the interaction mechanism between PEG400 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) (UGT1A8 and UGT1A9). The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that following the co-intravenous administration of PEG400 and BG, the total clearance (CL<sub>z</sub>) of BG in the rat plasma decreased by 101.60% (p < 0.05), whereas the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)<sub>0-t</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> increased by 144.59% (p < 0.05) and 140.05% (p < 0.05), respectively. Additionally, the tissue distribution study showed that the concentration of BG and baicalein-6-O-\u03b2-D-glucuronide (B6G) in the tissues increased, whereas baicalein (B) in the tissues decreased, and the total amount of BG and its metabolites in tissues altered following the intravenous administration of PEG400. We further found that PEG400 induced the UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 enzyme activities by affecting the maximum enzymatic velocity (V<sub>max</sub>) and Michaelis-Menten constant (K<sub>m</sub>) values of UGT1A8 and UGT1A9. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PEG400 interaction with UGTs altered the pharmacokinetic behaviors and tissue distribution characteristics of BG and its metabolites in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
