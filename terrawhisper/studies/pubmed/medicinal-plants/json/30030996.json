In present study, at first Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC) was compared with Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) based on their selectivity (\u03b1), retention factor (k), and resolution (R) for cytosine (C) and 5mC nucleobases. We tried to justify the separation mechanism on the basis of mobile phase and solute polarity, structural characterization of solute and stationary phases, log Do/w, and pk<sub>a</sub> under both modes. Then, these two modes were compared in order to select the best column for measurement of methylation level in two real samples with less analytical complexity (i.e. animal and bacteria) and a highly complex sample (i.e. plant), after chemical hydrolysis of DNA. In this favor, diol and cyano (CN) columns in HILIC mode as well as C<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>18</sub> in RP-HPLC were investigated. Optimum separation and the best validation parameters were obtained for CN column with Limit of Detection (LOD) of 1.4\u202fpmol and Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of 4.8\u202fpmol for 5mC. When the CN column was used in HILIC-UV procedure, separation of 5mC and C bases was achieved in all types of hydrolyzed DNA solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
