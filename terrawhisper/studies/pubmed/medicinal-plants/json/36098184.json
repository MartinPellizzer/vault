Roscoe) is a plant that has long been used as a medicinal herb for humans, so it has been grown and popularized in the Mekong Delta Provinces, but the research systematic genetics has not been given much attention. The current study evaluated the genetic characteristics of some ginger samples collected in eight provinces in the Mekong Delta based on morphological characteristics and ITS gene sequence regions. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Samples of Ginger varieties were collected in eight provinces, fresh leaf samples were collected and stored frozen at -20\u00b0C. Ginger morphology observation and description based on improved plant research methods. Total DNA extraction of ginger leaf samples was extracted from fresh leaf samples according to the extraction procedure by the modified CTAB method. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The phenotypes of the samples like length, leaf width, flower length and fruit diameter were significantly different between growing regions due to different environmental and farming conditions. Genetic relationship analysis showed that there are two distinct groups. Group I has 5 ginger samples from G8-Vinh Long, G4-Ben Tre, G2-Ca Mau, G5-Dong Thap and G6-Hau Giang provinces and group II includes ginger varieties belonging to G7-Ho Chi Minh City, G1-An Giang Province and G3-City. Can Tho. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Samples/cultivars collected from eight provinces in the Mekong Delta showed variation in agronomic characteristics, but only stem height and length changes were statistically significantly different. Genotyping most of the samples belonged to the species &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt; (Wild) Roscoe."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Duong", "ForeName": "Thieu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Mai", "ForeName": "Do", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Trong Ngon", "ForeName": "Truong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Hung", "ForeName": "Mai", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Zingiber officinale"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36098184", "10.3923/pjbs.2022.495.500"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
