This fiber source has been shown to have a pronounced lipid lowering effect in mice. Its high oxalic acid content may, however, be a limiting factor for its use. The present study was undertaken to determine the safe dose level of the fiber in terms of its effect on calcium bioavailability. Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a semi-purified diet (AIN 76) for 4 weeks containing 0, 1, 3, or 5% rhubarb fiber, or pure oxalic acid equivalent to 5% rhubarb fiber. The fiber content of each diet was brought to 5% by adding cellulose, and the calcium level of all diets was the same. As the rhubarb stalk fiber content of the diet increased, a consistent trend of increasing total retention and apparent absorption of calcium was manifested. In contrast, however, cellulose, due to its increased effect on intestinal motility resulted in a decreased calcium bioavailability. Overall results suggest that an addition of rhubarb stalk powder up to the level of 5% in a diet does not have detrimental effect on calcium bioavailability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."}], "LastName": "Goel", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ooraikul", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Basu", "ForeName": "T K", "Initials": "TK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "9432922", "ISSNLinking": "0963-7486"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9004-34-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Cellulose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cellulose"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8833180", "10.3109/09637489609012577"]}}]}
