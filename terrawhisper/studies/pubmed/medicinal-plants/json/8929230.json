(1) The contractile behaviour of attached myocytes was analyzed by an image processing system. (2) The energy turnover was calculated from the decrease in oxygen content in the myocyte suspension, brought about by cellular respiration. It was differentiated between energy turnover related to cell shortening and that required for ionic transport processes by application of the contraction-inhibiting agent 2,3-butanedione monoxime. (3) The apparent refractory period (t(ref)) was evaluated by pacing the myocytes with increasing stimulation rates and determining the frequency at which failure of single contractions occurred. For these purposes, the myocytes were incubated in a stimulation chamber, which is part of a computer-assisted system allowing to simultaneously evaluate the mechanics and energetics of electrically induced contraction. Within a range of 30-180 microg/ml, the hawthorn extract exhibited a positive inotropic effect on the contraction amplitude accompanied by a moderate increase of energy turnover both for mechanical and ionic processes. In comparison with other positive inotropic interventions, such as application of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline, or of the cardiac glycoside ouabain (g-strophantin), or elevation of the extracellular Ca++-concentration, the effects of the hawthorn extract were significantly more economical with respect to the energetics of the myocytes. Furthermore the extract prolonged the apparent refractory period in the presence and the absence of isoprenaline, which be indicative for an antiarrhythmic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Physiology, Medical Faculty, Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Technische Hochschule, Aachen, Germany."}], "LastName": "P\u00f6pping", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rose", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ionescu", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kammermeier", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic beta-Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic beta-Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Refractory Period, Electrophysiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8929230"]}}]}
