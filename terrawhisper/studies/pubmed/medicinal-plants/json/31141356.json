Shiya tea (leaves of Adinandra nitida), a traditional Chinese tea, is widely consumed due to its palatable flavor and various curative effects, such as reducing blood pressure and blood lipids, as well as anti-inflammation, etc. However, no relevant research on the antiobesity effects of Shiya tea has been reported. In particular, no health-benefiting compounds, other than flavonoids, in Shiya tea have been reported. Thus, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes have been used as a bioactivity-guided identification model to verify the inhibitory effects of Shiya tea on adipogenesis, as well as to identify antiadipogenic compounds. Four triterpenoid saponins (1-4), including one new compound (2\u03b1,3\u03b1-dihydroxyursolic acid 28- O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl ester, compound 1), and a flavonoid (5) have been identified using NMR (1D and 2D NMR) and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS techniques. Compound 1, the major antiadipogenic constituent with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 27.6 \u03bcg/mL, has been identified for the first time in Shiya tea. To understand the structure-activity relationship, three hydrolytic compounds (1s, 2s, and 5s) were obtained to provide an inhibitory effect on lipid accumulation during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. The inhibitory effect of the triterpenoid (1s) possessing no sugar group decreased significantly, while the flavonoid (5s) also without a sugar group showed increased activity. In addition, the hydroxyl group position may also play a role in inhibitory efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Citrus Research and Education Center, Food Science and Human Nutrition , University of Florida , 700 Experiment Station Road , Lake Alfred , Florida 33850 , United States."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , 3491 Baijin Road , Guiyang 550014 , P.
