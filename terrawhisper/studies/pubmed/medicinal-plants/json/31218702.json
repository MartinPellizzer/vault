Angiogenesis is a critical process that contributes to various chronic diseases via excessive delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Common anti-angiogenic drugs have serious problems related to high costs and side effects; thus, natural products with low costs and no cytotoxicity have garnered increasing interest. In this study, we evaluated and compared the anti-angiogenic effects and phenolic compound contents between wild (WOEs) and cultivated O. japonicus extracts (COEs) prepared under various extract conditions. WOEs and COEs suppressed cell proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor-induced chemotactic migration, invasion, and capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs. Among COEs, that prepared by 70% EtOH (70% CE) showed the most effective anti-angiogenic activity in HUVECs. When compared to WOEs, total polyphenol and total flavonoid contents were 1.28 to 4.38 times higher in COEs, and 70% CE contained the greatest flavonoid contents (28.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.93 mg%), as well as the highest levels of major phenolic compounds including gallic acid (21.84 \u00b5g/mL), epicatechin-gallate (6.58 \u00b5g/mL), kaempferol (6.32 \u00b5g/mL), and quercetin (8.55 \u00b5g/mL). Although further studies are required to identify the molecular mechanisms behind these anti-angiogenic effects, 70% CE could be used as an herbal medicine, functional food ingredient, and potent angiogenesis inhibitor. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Environmental factors such as altitude, nutrients, exposure to sunlight, and temperature can influence the type and quantity of bioactive components in plants. The advantage of cultivated plants is that the above-mentioned factors can be artificially adjusted compared to wild plants. Based on economic efficiency, productivity, and consistent quality, anti-angiogenesis activity of cultivated O. japonicus is of greater commercial value as a functional food than wild O. japonicus."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Institute of Food Technologists\u00ae."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Industry-Academy Cooperation, Dong-A Univ., Busan, 49315, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Hyun-Dong", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biotechnology, Dong-A Univ., Busan, 49315, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Kwan-Woo", "Initials": "KW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Biotechnology, Dong-A Univ., Busan, 49315, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "Yeong-Seon", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Development in Oriental Medicine Resources, Sunchon Natl.
