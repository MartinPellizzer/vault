Eucalyptol was verified with exact anti-oxidation effects <i>via</i> stimulating the secretion of endogenous antioxidant enzymes against ROS. However, the volatility, instability and poor water solubility of eucalyptol limited its pharmacological activities <i>in\u00a0vivo</i>. In this study, we developed carboxymethyl chitosan-coated lipid nanoparticles for eucalyptol (CMC/ELN) to facilitate oral administration. A thin lipid film dispersion method was used to prepare the ELN. After CMC coating, the diameter of ELN increased from 166\u2009nm to 177\u2009nm and charge reversal was observed. The nanocarrier enhanced the protective effects of eucalyptol both in the high level of glucose (HG)-damaged HUVECs and endothelial injury in type I diabetes mellitus (T<sub>1</sub>DM) rat model. Furthermore, the mechanism of eucalyptol on the promotion of Nrf2 and HO-1 and reduction on Keap1 expression have been verified both in the <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> and <i>in\u00a0vivo</i> model. Besides, the pharmacokinetics data were verified the promotion of the oral eucalyptol absorption by the nanocarrier. Taken together, we established an optimal oral delivery system that promoted oral administration of eucalyptol to exert protective effects on hyperglycaemia-induced vascular endothelial injury."]},
