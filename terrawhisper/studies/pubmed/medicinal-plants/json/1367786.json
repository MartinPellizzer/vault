Both enzymes showed little activity against intact fucosylated XG and they were totally inactive against p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucoside. Auxin treatment of pea stems, which greatly increased the activity of endo-1,4-beta-glucanases that hydrolyse XG in apical growing regions, failed to result in a similar increase in XG-nonasaccharide alpha-fucosidase activity. However, germination of nasturtium seed, which resulted in a large increase in endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (XG-ase) activity in the cotyledons, was accompanied by comparable increases in XG-alpha-fucosidase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."}], "LastName": "Farkas", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hanna", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maclachlan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37294-28-3", "NameOfSubstance": "xyloglucan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.51", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-L-Fucosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-L-Fucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1367786", "10.1016/0031-9422(91)83176-l", "0031-9422(91)83176-L"]}}]}
