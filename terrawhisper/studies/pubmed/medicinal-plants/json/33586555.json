In 2019, World Health Organization global report on traditional and complementary medicine has also substantiated the revival of herbal medicine including its convergence with conventional medicine for the management and prevention of diseases. It means these industries need plenty of plant materials to meet the unprecedented demands of herbal formulations. However, it is pertinent to mention here that around 70-80% medicinal plants are sourced from the wild and most of such highly acclaimed plants are listed under Rare, Endangered and Threatened species by IUCN. Additionally, over 30% traditional health formulations are based on underground plant parts, which lead to the uprooting of plants. Overharvesting from limited plant populations, meager conventional cultivation and a rising fondness for natural products exerting enormous pressure on natural habitats. Therefore, the nondestructive means of phytochemical production employing biotechnological tools could be used for sustainable production and consumption patterns. In recent years, a number of reports described the use of adventitious roots induced under <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> conditions for the extraction of phytochemicals on a sustainable basis. In this article, efforts are made to review recent developments in this area as well as understand the induction mechanisms of adventitious roots, their <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> cultivation, probable factors that affect the growth and metabolite production, and assess the possibility of industrial scale production to meet the rising demands of natural herbs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Jyoti", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Roushan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Khem", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}], "LastName": "Gehlot", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7898-5776"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dietetics and Nutrition Technology, CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}], "LastName": "Bhushan", "ForeName": "Shashi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT), Palampur, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sanjay", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33586555", "10.1080/07388551.2020.1869690"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
