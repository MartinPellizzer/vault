There were 13 clusters formed at 84% similarity by numerical taxonomy. The genetic diversity was highly revealed by 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP. The diversity of genomic level was described by BOX-PCR fingerprints. The results were correlated well with numerical analysis. Homology analysis was made by searching in Genbank with NCBI, and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that SCAU11 was highly related to B. sphaericus, SCAU78 and SCAU25 were identified as B. subtilis subspecies, SCAU39 was highly related to B. megaterium.", "Overall, the study results demonstrated a high phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity of endophytic Bacillus isolated from Medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Resources and Environmental Science, Sichuan Agricultural University, Ya'an 625000, China. chenlanmail@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lan", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiaoping", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kristina", "ForeName": "Lindstrom", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21610860R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodiversity"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Ribosomal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18590226"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
