We investigated the effects of the recombinant form of this lectin (rVAA) on secretion of interleukin (IL)-12 and on NK-mediated cytotoxicity against K562 target cells in cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as against YAC-1 target cells in cultured rat spleen cells. In 24-hour cultures of PBMC, 10 ng/ml plant VAA-I and 50 ng/ml rVAA induced significant increases in the secretion of total IL-12. Its biologically active heterodimeric form, p70, was also significantly induced by rVAA. Preincubation of PBMC or splenocytes for 48 h with rVAA in concentrations ranging between 10 pg/ml and 100 pg/ml resulted in moderate enhancements of NK-mediated cytotoxicity. However, coincubation of a low dose of rVAA (100 pg/ml) together with IL-2 and IL-12 (60 U/ml and 2 U/ml, respectively) led to additive stimulation of NK activity. In in vivo experiments, rVAA showed an enhancing effect on NK activity with a bell-shaped curve of efficacy. Forty-eight hours after a single intravenous injection of its most effective doses, 0.5 and 1 ng/kg, into Wistar rats, the NK cytotoxicity of splenocytes against YAC-1 targets doubled, and the frequency of large granular lymphocytes in peripheral blood showed 2.1- and 3-fold increases as compared to control animals. Twenty-four hours following these low lectin doses, the number of large granular lymphocytes was also significantly elevated. After 48 h, 0.5 ng/kg rVAA induced a significant augmentation in the percentage of peripheral Mac-1+ mononuclear cells, including activated monocytes and NK cells. The present results suggest that rVAA augments the secretion of an active form of IL-12 and potentiates the cytokine-induced NK activation. These effects of rVAA may be related to its stimulatory effects on MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Hajto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hostanska", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Weber", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zinke", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mengs", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lentzen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saller", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Nat Immun", "NlmUniqueID": "9206126", "ISSNLinking": "1018-8916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "VAA-I protein, Viscum album"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "187348-17-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-12"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.2.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-12"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "2"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9789123", "10.1159/000069428", "nam16034"]}}]}
