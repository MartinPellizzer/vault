In this study, it was first looked into how chitosan/alginate scaffolds were made and characterized in the presence of berberine and barberry fruit extract. Second, the process of proliferation and differentiation of ovine fetal BM-MSCs (bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells) was assessed on these scaffolds after BM-MSCs were extracted and confirmed by developing into osteocyte and adipose cells. To investigate the differentiation, treatment groups include (1) ovine fetal BM-MSCs were plated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium culture medium with high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (negative control), (2) ovine fetal BM-MSCs were plated in osteogenic differentiation medium (positive control group), (3) positive control group + barberry fruit extract, (4) positive control group + berberine, (5) ovine fetal BM-MSCs were plated in osteogenic differentiation medium on chitosan/alginate scaffold (hydrogel group), (6) ovine fetal BM-MSCs were plated in osteogenic differentiation medium on chitosan/alginate/barberry fruit extract scaffold (hydrogel group containing barberry fruit extract), and (7) ovine fetal BM-MSCs were plated in osteogenic differentiation medium on chitosan/alginate/berberine scaffold (hydrogel group containing berberine). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme concentrations, mineralization rate using a calcium kit, and mineralization measurement by alizarin staining quantification were all found after 21 days of culture. In addition, real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the expression of the ALP, COL1A2, and Runx2 genes. Days 5 and 7 had the lowest water absorption by the hydrogel scaffold containing barberry extract, which was significant in comparison to other groups (p\u2009<\u2009.05). Among the hydrogel scaffolds under study, the one containing barberry extract exhibited the lowest tensile strength, and this difference was statistically significant (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The chitosan/alginate hydrogel has the highest tensile strength of all of them. In comparison to the control and other treatment groups, the inclusion of berberine in the chitosan/alginate hydrogel significantly increased the expression of the ALP, Runx2, and COL1A2 genes (p\u2009<\u2009.05). The osteocyte differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in in vitro settings appears to have been enhanced by the inclusion of berberine in the chitosan/alginate scaffold."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5007-5110"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soltani", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4536-6041"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaneialvar", "ForeName": "Hori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4457-3997"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2021-8616"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Isfahan University of Technology, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bayat", "ForeName": "Parvaneh", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4755-2112"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Chemistry Department, Faculty of Chemistry, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazari", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Ilam University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cell Biochem Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "8305874", "ISSNLinking": "0263-6484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alginates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogels"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Berberis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alginates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogels"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Khatkar H, See A.
