Existing drugs on the market are very often toxic and have many side effects, hence the need to find new, more active molecules. It has been demonstrated in several works that medicinal plants constitute a wide range of new molecules that can solve this problem. Several works have already been able to demonstrate that cyclic peptides of plant origin have shown good activity in the fight against different types of helminths. Therefore, this review aims to provide a general overview of the methods and techniques of extraction, isolation, activities and mechanisms of action of cyclotides and other cyclic peptides for application in the treatment of helminthic infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
