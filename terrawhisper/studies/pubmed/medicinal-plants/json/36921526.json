To develop new \"hidden\" multifunctional agents through AChE/BuChE would be a promising strategy to treat AD. To this end, firstly, a series of chalcone derivatives with chelating property was designed and synthesized. The in vitro results showed that compound 3f indicated significant selective MAO-B inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.67\u00a0\u03bcM) and remarkable anti-inflammatory property. It also significantly inhibited self-induced A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation and showed remarkable neuroprotective effects on A\u03b2<sub>25-35</sub>-induced PC12\u00a0cell injury. Furthermore, compound 3f was a selective metal chelator and could inhibit Cu<sup>2+</sup>-induced A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> aggregation. Based on this, the carbamate fragment was introduced to compound 3f to obtain carbamate derivatives. The biological activity results exhibited that compound 4b showed good BBB permeability, good AChE inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u00a0\u03bcM), moderate BuChE inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a012.4\u00a0\u03bcM), significant MAO-B inhibitory potency, anti-inflammation potency on LPS-induced BV-2\u00a0cells and neuroprotective effects on A\u03b2<sub>25-35</sub>-induced PC12\u00a0cell injury. Compared with 3f, compound 4b did not show obvious chelation property. Significantly, compound 4b could be activated by AChE/BuChE following inhibition of AChE/BuChE to liberate an active multifunctional chelator 3f, which was consistent with our original intention. More importantly, compounds 3f and 4b presented favorable ADME properties and good stability in artificial gastrointestinal fluid, blood plasma and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo results suggested that compound 4b (0.0195\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) could significantly improve dyskinesia and reaction capacity of the AlCl<sub>3</sub>-induced zebrafish AD model by increasing the level of ACh. Together our data suggest that compound 4b was a promising \"hidden\" multifunctional agent by AChE/BuChE, and this strategy deserved further development for the treatment of AD."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
