Fritsch leaves. After identification of the plant, its ethanolic extract was obtained using Soxhlet extractor without leaving any chemicals in it. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed to detect the percentage, retention index, and time of A. Saralicum compounds. Agar diffusion tests were applied to determine the antibacterial and antifungal characteristics. In agar disk diffusion test, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as negative control, while antibacterial (Difloxacin, Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, Gentamicin, Oxytetracycline, Ampicillin, and Amikacin) and antifungal (Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Miconazole, Amphotericin B, and Nystatin) antibiotics were used as positive controls. Macro broth tube test was run to determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The findings indicated that linolenic acid, methyl ester was the most frequent constituent found in A. Saralicum. Indeed, A. Saralicum showed higher antibacterial and antifungal properties than all standard antibiotics (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01). Also, A. Saralicum prevented the growth of all bacteria and fungi at 15-125\u202fmg/mL concentrations and destroyed them at 15-250\u202fmg/mL concentrations (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01). DPPH free radical scavenging test was carried out to examine the antioxidant effect, which indicated similar antioxidant activity with butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) as a positive control. The synthesized ethanolic extract had great cell viability dose-dependently and demonstrated this method was nontoxic for synthesizing A. Saralicum. In conclusion, the findings showed the useful antioxidant, non-cytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal effects of A. Saralicum ethanolic extract."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
