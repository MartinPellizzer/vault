The aim of this study was to assesse the effect of Salba-chia on body weight, visceral obesity and obesity-related risk factors in overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes.", "A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with two parallel groups involved 77 overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA<sub>1c</sub>: 6.5-8.0%; BMI: 25-40\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Both groups followed a 6-month calorie-restricted diet; one group received 30\u00a0g/1000\u00a0kcal/day of Salba-chia, the other 36\u00a0g/1000\u00a0kcal/day of an oat bran-based control. Primary endpoint was change in body weight over 6-months. Secondary endpoints included changes in waist circumference, body composition, glycemic control, C-reactive protein, and obesity-related satiety hormones.", "At 6-months, participants on Salba-chia had lost more weight than those on control (1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0kg and 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0kg, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.020), accompanied by a greater reduction in waist circumference (3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0cm and 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0cm, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.027). C-reactive protein was reduced by 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0mg/L (39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017%) on Salba-chia, compared to 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mg/L (7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020%) on control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045). Plasma adiponectin on the test intervention increased by 6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%, with no change observed on control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022).", "The results of this study, support the beneficial role of Salba-chia seeds in promoting weight loss and improvements of obesity related risk factors, while maintaining good glycemic control. Supplementation of Salba-chia may be a useful dietary addition to conventional therapy in the management of obesity in diabetes.
