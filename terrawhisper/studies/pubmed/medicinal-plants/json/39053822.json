These plants are consumed both raw and cooked and are noted in traditional medicine for their antibacterial, antitumor, and diuretic properties. Allium plants are a rich source of polyphenols, organosulfur compounds, flavonoids, alkaloids, and polysaccharides, which contribute to their health benefits. As consumer interest in the association between diet and health grows, there is an increasing market demand for foods that promote health, particularly those rich in dietary fiber or non-starch polysaccharides. Allium polysaccharides (APS) have molecular weights of 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>3</sup>-1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10<sup>6</sup>\u202fDa containing small amounts of pectin, glucofructan, or glycoproteins and large amounts of fructans. APS, despite its complex structure, is one of the principal active components of Allium plants but is often overlooked, which restricts its practical application. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the extraction and purification, structural and functional characteristics, bioactivities, structure-function relationships, and chemical modifications of APS, as well as the effects of APS processing and storage. Additionally, this paper outlines future research directions for APS, which will inform its development and application in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
