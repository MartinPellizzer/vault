This study investigates the effects of clonidine and Thymbra spicata extract (TSE) on mice suffering from morphine withdrawal syndrome. Thymol, which is the active constituent in TSE, was also tested. A total of 90 mice were divided into nine groups. Group 1 was the control group, while Group\u00a02 was given only morphine, and Group 3 received morphine and 0.2\u2009mg/kg of clonidine. Groups 4-6 were given morphine along with 100, 200, and 300\u2009mg/kg of TSE, respectively. Groups 7-9 received morphine plus 30, 60, and 90\u2009mg/kg of Thymol, respectively, for 7 days. An oral naloxone challenge of 3\u2009mg/kg was used to induce withdrawal syndrome in all groups. Improvement of liver enzyme levels (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine transaminase) (p\u2009<\u2009.01) and behavioral responses (frequencies of jumping, frequencies of two-legged standing, Straub tail reaction) (p\u2009<\u2009.01) were significantly observed in the groups receiving TSE and Thymol (Groups 4-9) compared to Group 2. Additionally, antioxidant activity in these groups was improved compared to Group 2. Nitric oxide\u00a0significantly decreased in Groups 4 and 6 compared to Groups 2 and 3 (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Superoxide dismutase\u00a0increased dramatically in Groups 5, 8, and 9 compared to Groups 2 and 3 (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Groups 5-9 were significantly different from Group 2 in terms of malondialdehyde\u00a0levels (p\u2009<\u2009.01). Certain doses of TSE and Thymol were found to alleviate the narcotics withdrawal symptoms. This similar effect to clonidine can pave the way for their administration in humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1342-553X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Maleki", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4536-6041"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaneialvar", "ForeName": "Hori", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4457-3997"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3704-5347"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ramsar Campus, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Ramsar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moayeri", "ForeName": "Ardeshir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8089-5080"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moulaei", "ForeName": "Neda", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9928-8627"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kenarkoohi", "ForeName": "Azra", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5290-3736"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokaribahar", "ForeName": "Pegah", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6713-755X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heidari", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Cell Biochem Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "8305874", "ISSNLinking": "0263-6484"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3J50XA376E", "NameOfSubstance": "Thymol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MN3L5RMN02", "NameOfSubstance": "Clonidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Thymol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Clonidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hossaini D, Alami K, Nazari M, Ebrahimi K, Salehi M, Mousavi S.
