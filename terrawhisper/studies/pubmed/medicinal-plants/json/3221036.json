For the system described, the most active immobilized urease derivatives were prepared with 2 mg/ml of the solubilized urease solution and use of higher enzyme concentrations proved wasteful. Although urease coupling without thermal denaturation of the solubilized enzyme was achieved at 20 degrees C, derivatives prepared at 37 degrees C yielded maximal activity over the 3 h coupling period. Also, longer incubations of the enzyme solution in the tube were unnecessary under these conditions. Optimal pH for the coupling process was 6.5, one at which the solubilized enzyme was most stable."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Jos, Makurdi, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Onyezili", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem Biophys Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "7907378", "ISSNLinking": "0165-022X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nylons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alkylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes, Immobilized"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nylons"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3221036", "10.1016/0165-022x(88)90059-0", "0165-022X(88)90059-0"]}}]}
