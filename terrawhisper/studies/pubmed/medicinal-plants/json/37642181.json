Three species are reported from the genus <i>Gelsemium</i>, including <i>Gelsemium elegans</i> (Gardn. & Camp.) Benth., <i>Gelsemium sempervirens</i> (L.) J.St.-Hil., and <i>Gelsemium rankinii</i> Small. Among them, <i>G. elegans</i> is well known for its toxicity and is used as a traditional remedy for skin problems, neuralgia, fractures, and cancer. The first record of the toxic medicine <i>G. elegans</i> is the Chinese herbal medicine classically known as <i>Shen-Nong Ben-Cao Jing.</i> In the legend, the Shennong emperor was poisoned by <i>G. elegans</i>, hence, it is also wellknown as Duan Chang Cao in China. In addition, <i>G. sempervirens</i> tincture is also used in the treatment of inflammation of the spinalcolumn, and diminishes blood to the cerebrospinal centers.", "This review aims to provide up-to-date information on <i>Gelsemium</i> and its endophytic fungi on their traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology. Mechanism studies regarding the detoxification profile of <i>Gelsemium</i> are also reviewed.", "For this updated review, the literature survey and search were performed on the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, Wiley, China CNKI, Web of Science, SciFinder, and Google Scholar using the relevant keywords.", "The plants of the genus <i>Gelsemium</i> are all reported as rich sources of monoterpene indole alkaloids. Previous phytochemical studies published more than 200 alkaloids from <i>Gelsemium</i> and its endophytic fungi, which have attracted considerable attention from pharmaceutists and phytochemists due to their diverse and complex structures. The bioactivities of<i> Gelsemium</i> phytoconstituents studied using various chemical methods are summarized and described herein. Considering the huge influence of <i>Gelsemium</i> regarding its traditional applications, the activities of isolated compounds were focused on the anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antianxiety, immunostimulatory, and immunosuppressive properties, which provide evidence supporting the ethnopharmacological effectiveness of the genus <i>Gelsemium</i>. Unlike all previous reviews of genus <i>Gelsemium</i>, to the best of our knowledge, the recently reported natural products from its endophytic fungi are first time summarized in this review.", "It is clearly suggested from the literature information that the structures and biological activities of <i>Gelsemium</i> have a wide range of attraction from folk to the community of scholars. However, as a highly toxic genus, the work on the detoxification mechanism and toxicology of <i>Gelsemium</i> is urgently needed before entering clinical research. It is noteworthy that the discussion about the relationship between structural and biological activities are a valuable topic of expectation, while the structural modification for active or toxic components may shed light on toxicological breakthrough. Besides the compounds from the plants of genus <i>Gelsemium</i>, the recently reported natural products from its endophytic fungi may provide a supplement for its ethnomedicinal uses and ethnological validity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Yun-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Jia-Jun", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, 22060, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Afsar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Pan-Pan", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Humanities and Management, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Da", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Guizhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang, 550025, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gelsemium"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37642181", "10.2174/1568026623666230825105233", "CTMC-EPUB-134049"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
