The ST-Zn-Se-NPs-AC composite was characterized by FE-SEM, UV-Vis, EDS, and XRD techniques. The removal percentage dependence to different variables such as initial BF concentration, pH, dosage of adsorbent, and time of sonication was investigated by Central Composite Design (CCD) under Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The quadratic model between the independent and dependent variables was predicted. A good agreement between the experimental and predicted data was achieved by the predicted model that showed the performance of the predicted model for predicting of real optimum points, and it was successfully employed to remove BF from aqueous media. The maximum removal percentage of 99.34% was obtained by the predicted model under the optimum conditions (15\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> of initial BF concentration, pH of 7.0, 12\u00a0mg of ST-Zn-Se-NPs-AC, and 6\u00a0min of sonication time), which was very close to the experimental value (99.00%). Moreover, the data were efficiently fitted by Langmuir model, and the saturation adsorption capacity (Q<sub>max</sub>) at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for BF was discovered to be 222.72\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
