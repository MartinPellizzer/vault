CMs in LbGp-treated group and hypxia group were cultured in an incubator ventilated with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 with or without LbGP. CMs viability under hypoxia was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetry (MTT). The intracellular free calcium concentration in cardiomyocytes was measured by laser confocal microscope with Fura-3/AM as a calcium indicator. The protective effects of LbGp on the CMs treated by KCl (60 mmol x L(-1)) was observed.", "As compared with normal controls, the degree of MTT metabolism was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) in hypoxic group and slightly reduced in LbGp (P < 0.05). Hypoxia-induced enhancement of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) was attenuated by LbGp significantly (P < 0.01). Moreover, KCl-induced enhancement of [Ca2+]i was also reduced by LbGp at the doses of 25, 50, 100 microg x mL(-1) in a concentration-dependent manner.", "The result suggested that LbGp is able to increase the survival ratio and inhibit the enhancement of the intracellular free calcium concentration in cardiomyocytes induced by hypoxia and high potassium. One of the mechanisms is that LbGp acts on L-type calcium channels."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Nanfang 210029, China. slheart@njmu.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shun-lin", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Geng-yuan", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Hypoxia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Myocytes, Cardiac"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16011102"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
