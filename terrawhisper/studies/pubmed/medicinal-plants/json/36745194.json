Plant-derived functional foods are becoming increasingly important to the healthcare and food industries for adjunctive and alternative treatments of ALI. Polyphenols have been regarded to be beneficial to the prevention and amelioration of ALI. <i>Rosa roxburghii</i> Tratt fruit polyphenols (RRTP) has potential to prevent ALI, but mechanism remains unclear. This study was set up to systematically analyze the RRTP extract active ingredients, comprehensively evaluate its protective effects via lung histopathological examination, protein concentration, and cytokines production in ALI mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and finally revealed alleviation mechanisms of the regulatory effects of RRTP by proteomics and metabolomics approach. The results demonstrated RRTP could synergistically exert significant preventive effects against ALI by notably ameliorating lung histopathological damage and pulmonary capillary permeability in ALI mice, inhibiting lung tissue inflammatory response and acute phase proteins and S-100 calcium binding proteins, suppressing excessive activation of complement and coagulation cascades, and regulating disordered lipids metabolism and amino acid metabolism. This study illustrated that RRTP has obvious advantages in ALI adjunctive therapy and revealed the complicated amelioration mechanisms, which provides a breakthrough for the development and demonstration of RRTP as a nutritional compound additive for complementary therapy of ALI."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5929-6975"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center of Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Ethnic Medicine, Guizhou Minzu University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Medical Sciences & Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center of Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center of Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences & Microbiology and Biochemical Pharmaceutical Engineering Research Center of Guizhou Provincial Department of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng-Jiao", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Translational Medicine Research Center & State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Gui-You", "Initials": "GY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiu-Li", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Proteomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Lung Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36745194", "10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04344"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
