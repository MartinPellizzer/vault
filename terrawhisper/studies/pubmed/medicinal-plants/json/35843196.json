A higher persistence of bacteria on biofilms makes them resistant not only to harsh conditions but also to various antibiotics which led to the emergence of problems in different applications. Recently, it has been discovered that many bacteria produce and release various D-amino acids (D-AAs) to inhibit biofilm formation, which made a great deal of interest in research into the control of bacterial biofilms in diverse fields, such as human health, industrial settings, and medical devices. D-AAs have various mechanisms to inhibit bacterial biofilms such as: (i) interfering with protein synthesis (ii) Inhibition of extracellular polymeric materials (EPS) productions (protein, eDNA, and polysaccharide) (iii) Inhibition of quorum sensing (autoinducers), and (iv) interfere with peptidoglycan synthesis, these various modes of action, enables these small molecules to inhibit both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial biofilms. Since most biofilms are multi-species, D-AAs in combination with other antimicrobial agents are good choices to combat a variety of bacterial biofilms without displaying toxicity on human cells. This review article addressed the role of D-AAs in controlling several bacterial biofilms and described the possible or definite mechanisms involved in this process."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
