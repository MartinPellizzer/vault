By the year 2012, the global sales of hair dye had exceeded $15 billion, with a sustained growth at a rate of 8%-10% annually. However, the harm caused by long-term use of hair dyes has aroused widespread public concern, so people begin to seek non-toxic or low toxic natural plant hair dyes. The types of commonly used hair dyes and the corresponding dyeing mechanisms were summarized in this manuscript, and the representative natural botanic dyes were listed. Thereafter, their effective fractions, constituents and application status were described. In addition, the values of botanic hair dyes and their broad market prospect were discussed. Finally, the problems that exist in the research and development of plant hair dyes were issued. This review may help to provide thought for developing novel, green and ecological natural plant hair dyes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yu-Li", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Jiao-Yang", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Hong-Zheng", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 130118, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Shi-Hai", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mei-Hua", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hair Dyes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hair Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28920374", "10.4268/cjcmm20161717"]}}]}
