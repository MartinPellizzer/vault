Fifty-seven patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers of Wagner's ulcer grade 1-3 were enrolled in this study. Patients who were randomly assigned to the control group (n=28) received standard wound therapy (SWT), whereas those randomized to the treatment group (n=28) received SWT plus topical TYO.

Ulcer improvement was 79.2% in the TYO group and 41.7% in the SWT group (P=0.017) at 12 weeks, and 91.7% vs. 62.5% (P=0.036) at 24 weeks. The number of ulcers that were completely healed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks was similar in both groups, as were the numbers of adverse events.
