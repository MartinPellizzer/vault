Due to the variable pathology of these cancers and the lack of appropriate screening tests in developing countries, cancer diagnosis can be reported in advanced stages in most women and this situation adversely affects prognosis and clinical outcomes of illness. For this reason, many researchers in the field of gynecological oncology have carried out many studies. The treatment of various gynecological problems, which cause physical, biological and psychosocial conditions such as fear, shame, blame and anger, has been important throughout the history. Treatment with herbs has become popular nowadays due to the serious side effects of the synthetic drugs used in treatment and the medical and economical problems caused by them. Many scientists have identified various active drug substances through in vivo and in vitro biological activity studies on medicinal plants from the past to the present. While the intrinsic complexity of natural product-based drug discoveries requires highly integrated interdisciplinary approaches, scientific and technological advances and research trends clearly show that natural products will be among the most important new drug sources in the future. In this review, an overview of the studies conducted for the discovery of multitargeted drug molecules in the rational treatment of gynecological cancers is presented."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, Etiler 06330, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Akkol", "ForeName": "Esra K\u00fcpeli", "Initials": "EK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, Etiler 06330, Ankara, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Dereli", "ForeName": "Fatma Tu\u011f\u00e7e G\u00fcra\u011fa\u00e7", "Initials": "FTG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n e Innovaci\u00f3n en Salud, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Central de Chile, 8330507 Santiago, Spain."}], "LastName": "Sobarzo-S\u00e1nchez", "ForeName": "Eduardo", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan 23200, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Haroon", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Genital Neoplasms, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32297581", "10.2174/1568026620666200416084440", "CTMC-EPUB-105854"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
