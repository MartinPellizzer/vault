At pH 8.6, the activity was lost in a single exponential decay, characteristic of functional identity of sites as in a tetrahedral arrangement of subunits (or a D2-type symmetry). At intermittent pH values, the kinetics of thermal inactivation were consistent with the presence of a mixture of C2- and D2-symmetry conformations. In \"sudden pH change\" experiments, the observed thermal inactivation kinetics were characteristic of the final pH at which the enzyme was heated. Thus, the interconversion of the two conformations is facile and very fast. There is no gross change in molecular weight of the enzyme between pH 7.3 and 8.6."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Malhotra", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Srinivasan"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3970535", "10.1016/0003-9861(85)90683-6", "0003-9861(85)90683-6"]}}]}
