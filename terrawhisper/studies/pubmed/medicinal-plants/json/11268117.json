The effects on the ambulatory behaviour were assessed along with the levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum after a single oral dose (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight) of the extract. The extract significantly increased the spontaneous motility in animals. The ambulatory and rotatory behaviour in the treated groups were higher than in the control group (p < 0.05). There were marked differences in the ambulatory behaviour between 100 and 300 mg/kg, indicating that the responses were stimulatory and dose-dependent. The stereotypic behaviour which is characteristic of a dopamine agonist showed biphasic effects. However, there was no significant difference between the groups (p > 0.05). The results showed that the extract of the root of P. zeylanica specifically enhanced the spontaneous ambulatory activity without inducing stereotypic behaviour. The neurochemical estimations revealed elevated levels of DA and HVA in striatum compared with the control rats (p < 0.01). The levels were higher for the 100 mg/kg treated group than the other groups. The levels declined by increasing the dosage of the extract to 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, however, these levels remained higher than the control group. The relationship between motor activity and levels of dopamine are not parallel. These behavioural and biochemical results indicated stimulatory properties of the extract of the root of P. zeylanica, which may be mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms in the rat brain."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychopharmacology, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore - 560029, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bopaiah", "ForeName": "C P", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pradhan", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X77S6GMS36", "NameOfSubstance": "Homovanillic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Corpus Striatum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Homovanillic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11268117", "10.1002/ptr.702", "10.1002/ptr.702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
