To overcome some of the drawbacks of existing knowledge (systems) we have developed a computer version of a key for interfacing with pre-existing knowledgebase. Appearance of different types of biological databases on the World Wide Web (WWW) and hypertext links between them has made a large amount of information easily accessible to biologists. Storage of explicitly specified biological relationship between different entities as discrete entries can allow additional identification capabilities. These systems are designed to detect the identity of a natural product when it is unknown or to verify the product identity when an antifertility products is provided. We have built a database about the cytoskeleton that explores the natural product approach as antifertility drug and the gap in existing knowledge. The stored information is displayed along with other retrieved information. The system is capable to search for entities with specified properties. It is extensible so that new types of relationships may be incorporated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Science and Biotechnology, Jadavpur University, Calcutta, WB, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chattopadhyay", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pol Pharm", "NlmUniqueID": "2985167R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6837"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11243253"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
