In the present study the hepatoprotective and antioxidative effects of an aqueous extract of E. divaricata plant (Family-Compositae) were investigated against carbon tetrachloride induced hepatocellular injury in mice.", "Healthy male mice (30-35 g body weight, 6-8 wk old) were used. A single dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4, 0.5 ml/kg in olive oil) was administered ip to induce hepatotoxicity and the plant extract at a dose of 0.9 g/kg was administered orally by gavage. Animals were sacrificed 24 h and 4 days after the administration of CCl4. Blood and liver tissue were collected for the assessment of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and liver reduced glutathione level. The liver tissue was used for histopathological assessment of liver damage.", "Pre-treatment of mice with the plant extract of Epaltes (0.9 g/kg) orally for 7 days significantly reduced serum levels of ALT (P<0.01), AST (P<0.01) and ALP (P<0.001) enzymes by 21.40, 47.36 and 71.12 per cent respectively and significantly increased (P<0.001) the liver reduced glutathione level by 42.32 per cent, 24 h after the administration of carbon tetrachloride. A marked improvement in the enzyme activities and the liver reduced glutathione level was observed in the Epaltes pre-treated mice 4 days after the administration of carbon tetrachloride. Histopathological studies provided supportive evidence for the biochemical analysis.", "The results of the present study indicated that under the present experimental conditions, aqueous extract of Epaltes divaricata showed hepatoprotective abilities against carbon tetrachloride induced liver damage in mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, aculty of Medicine, University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hewawasam", "ForeName": "R P", "Initials": "RP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jayatilaka", "ForeName": "K A P W", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pathirana", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mudduwa", "ForeName": "L K B", "Initials": "LK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CL2T97X0V0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}], "CommentsCorrectionsList": [{"RefSource": "Indian J Med Res. 2004 Jul;120(1):9-11.", "PMID": "15299226"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Tetrachloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytoprotection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15299229"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
