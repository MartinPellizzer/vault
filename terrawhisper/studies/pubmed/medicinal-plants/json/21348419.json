TA-SSLNs have been prepared by a nanoprecipitation/solvent diffusion method. Poloxamer 188 was used as a stealth agent. The physicochemical parameters of TA-SSLNs were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy and stability. In vitro, phagocytosis was investigated by incubating TA-SSLNs and non-stealth tanshinone IIA-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (TA-NSLNs) with murine macrophages. In vivo, pharmacokinetics of TA-SSLNs and TA-NSLNs after a single dose intravenous injection to rat has been studied. The control was tanshinone IIA solution (TA-SOL). The results showed that TA-SSLNs had an average diameter of (91.3 +/- 3.4) nm, zeta potential of (-19.7 +/- 1.6) mV, drug loading of (4.7 +/- 0.5) % and entrapment efficiency of (92.5 +/- 2.1) %. Phagocytosis studies showed significant differences between TA-SSLNs and TA-NSLNs and demonstrated that the poloxamer 188 coating could decrease the macrophage uptake. In vivo experiments showed that the plasma concentration data of TA-SSLNs, TA-NSLNs and TA-SOL were all fitted to a two-compartment model. Areas under curve (AUCs) of TA-NSLNs and TA-SSLNs were 1.28 and 3.70 times than that of TA-SOL, respectively. TA-SSLNs had generated a long circulating time in blood with a mean residence time (MRT) of 5.286 h, compared to 3.051 h of TA-NSLNs and 0.820 h of TA-SOL. Poloxamer 188 modification on solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) reduced opsonization by serum proteins and the macrophage uptake. AUC of tanshinone IIA increased as a function of SLNs. In addition, TA-SSLNs exhibited much longer circulation lifetimes for tanshinone IIA than TA-NSLNs. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the incorporated drug can be modified by changing the surface characteristics of SLNs with the use of poloxamer 188."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiao-Xu", "Initials": "XX"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Zhi-Qiang", "Initials": "ZQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abietanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "03UUH3J385", "NameOfSubstance": "tanshinone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "106392-12-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Poloxamer"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Abietanes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Area Under Curve"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phagocytosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poloxamer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia miltiorrhiza"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21348419"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
