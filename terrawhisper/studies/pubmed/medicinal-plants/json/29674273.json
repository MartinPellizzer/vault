Due to dietary habits, environmental factors, stress and so on, larger numbers of person are diagnose with EC every year. Currently, the clinical treatment of EC mainly includes radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical resection alone or combined strategy. These treatment options are insufficient and often associated with a number of side effects. Medicinal herbs containing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) have been used as an adjunct treatment for alleviating the side effects of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and for improving the quality of life of cancer patients. The monomer compounds obtained from medicinal herbs also exhibit potential anti-cancer activity against various type cancer cell lines including esophageal cancer, and have the ability to enhance cancer cells sensitizing to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this review, we summarize some monomers and composite of medicinal herbs with anti-cancer activity for EC, and elaborate their mechanism of action. Understanding the exact mechanism of their actions may provide valuable information for their possible application in cancer therapy and prevention. This is beneficial for the use and development of medicinal herbs for diseases therapy in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
