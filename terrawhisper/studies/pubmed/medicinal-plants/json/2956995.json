Fully unsaturated polyprenyl phosphates were not used as effective acceptors by this system. Mannosyl-P-dolichol was formed most rapidly in the presence of long-chained dolichyl-P while mannosyl-PP-, glucosyl-PP- and GlcNAc-PP-dolichol were preferentially formed from relatively short-chained dolichyl phosphate acceptors. Glucosyl-PP- and mannosyl-PP-dolichol accumulated in the preparation without further metabolism, but GlcNAc-PP-dolichol was lengthened by addition of a second GlcNAc plus several [14C]mannose units to form an oligosaccharide fraction susceptible to the action of endoglycosidase H. This lipid-linked oligosaccharide could then be glycosylated in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose to form a longer oligosaccharide. It is concluded that levels of endogenous dolichyl phosphates in pea membranes are rate-limiting for several of the key glycosyltransferases required for oligosaccharide assembly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Torossian", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maclachlan", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dolichol Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycolipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleotides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyisoprenyl Phosphate Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyisoprenyl Phosphate Sugars"}, {"RegistryNumber": "12698-55-4", "NameOfSubstance": "dolichol monophosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dolichol Phosphates"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycolipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleotides"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyisoprenyl Phosphate Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyisoprenyl Phosphate Sugars"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2956995", "10.1016/0304-4165(87)90196-6", "0304-4165(87)90196-6"]}}]}
