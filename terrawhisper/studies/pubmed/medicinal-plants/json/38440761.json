Efficacy of the plant extracts of <i>O. hadiense, R. officinalis</i> and <i>C. spinarum</i> was evaluated against 3rd instar <i>Aedes aegypti</i> larvae and mortality was recorded. LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> of the various plant extracts were also calculated using probit analysis. The morphological analysis of treated larvae was also performed. Extracts of <i>O. hadiense, C. spinarium</i> and <i>R. officinalis</i> were prepared using different solvents viz chloroform, 70% ethanol and water. Of the screened extracts, the chloroform extracts of <i>O. hadiense</i> exhibited the highest larvicidal activities and has the minimum LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> (24\u00a0mg/ml and 198.411\u00a0mg/ml respectively). Chloroform extract of <i>C. spinarium</i> exhibited the least larvicidal activity with maximum LC<sub>50</sub> and LC<sub>90</sub> (736.883\u00a0mg/ml and 1188.699\u00a0mg/ml respectively). Microscopic analysis confirmed the changes in the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> larvae caused by various plants extracts. An accumulation of dark pigmentation was observed in abdominal region and in the anal papillae after contact and also showed major structural damage such as destruction of the gut."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Indian Society for Parasitology 2024.
