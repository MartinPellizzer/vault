Our previous study demonstrated that G. biloba exocarp extract (GBEE), an extract of a traditional Chinese herb, inhibits the formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms. However, GBEE is a crude extract that contains many components, and the underlying mechanisms of purified GBEE fractions extracted with solvents of different polarities are unknown.", "This study aimed to investigate the different components in GBEE fractions extracted with solvents of different polarities and their antibacterial effects and mechanisms against MRSA and Staphylococcus haemolyticus biofilms both in vitro and in vivo.", "The components in different fractions were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). Microbroth dilution assays and time growth curves were used to determine the antibacterial effects of the fractions on 15 clinical bacterial isolates. Crystal violet staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to identify the fractions that affected bacterial biofilm formation. The potential MRSA targets of the GBEE fraction obtained with petroleum ether (PE), denoted GBEE-PE, were screened by transcriptome sequencing, and the gene expression profile was verified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).", "HPLC-HRMS analysis revealed that the four GBEE fractions (extracted with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water) contained different ginkgo components, and the antibacterial effects decreased as the polarity of the extraction solvent increased. The antibacterial activity of GBEE-PE was greater than that of the GBEE fraction extracted with ethyl acetate (EA). GBEE-PE improved H. illucens survival and reduced MRSA colonization in model mouse organs. Crystal violet staining and SEM and TEM analyses revealed that GBEE-PE inhibited MRSA and S. haemolyticus biofilm formation. Transcriptional analysis revealed that GBEE-PE inhibits MRSA biofilms by altering ion transport, cell wall metabolism and virulence-related gene expression. In addition, the LO2 cell viability and H. illucens toxicity assay data showed that GBEE-PE at 20 mg/kg was nontoxic.", "The GBEE fractions contained different components, and their antibacterial effects decreased with increases in the polarity of the extraction solvent. GBEE-PE limited MRSA growth and biofilm formation by affecting ion transport, cell wall synthesis, and virulence-related pathways. This research provides a more detailed overview of the mechanism by which GBEE-PE inhibits MRSA both in vitro and in vivo and suggests that GBEE-PE is a new prospective antimicrobial with the potential to be used in MRSA therapeutics in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
