One deposit was collected after cooking and an oxygen delignification stage while the other was collected after bleaching with hydrogen peroxide. The deposits were Soxhlet extracted with acetone, and the extracts redissolved in chloroform and subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (MS) using short and medium length high temperature capillary columns, respectively. On the other hand, the insoluble residues left after the acetone extraction were analyzed by Curie-point flash pyrolysis-GC-MS and by pyrolysis-methylation-GC-MS. The compounds identified in the deposits arise from the E. globulus wood lipophilic extractives that survive the pulping and bleaching processes. Triglycerides were completely hydrolyzed during the Kraft cooking and the fatty acids dissolved. Steroids (alcohols, hydrocarbons, ketones and esters) and waxes were the main components in the deposit collected after the oxygen delignification stage. After the bleaching with hydrogen peroxide, content of the waxes were reduced and fatty acids appeared. High amounts of fatty acids salts were also identified in the deposit collected after the oxygen stage, and in minor amounts in the deposit collected after hydrogen peroxide bleaching. In contrast, this deposit was mainly made up of high amounts of lignin-derived phenolic moieties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institito de Recursos Naturales y Agrobiolog\u00eda de Sevilla, CSIC, Seville, Spain. delrio@irnase.csic.es"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "del R\u00edo", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Romero", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guti\u00e9rrez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Chromatogr A", "NlmUniqueID": "9318488", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4R7X1O2820", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H0W55235FC", "NameOfSubstance": "tetramethylammonium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorine"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quaternary Ammonium Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10817362", "10.1016/s0021-9673(00)00111-4", "S0021-9673(00)00111-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
