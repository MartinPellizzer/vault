In an attempt to investigate whether the effect of GTS is through its inhibitory action on the elevated dopaminergic transmission, we examined the effect of GTS on nicotine-induced dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NA) of freely moving rats using in vivo microdialysis. Systemic injection of nicotine (3 mg/kg; i.p.) produced a mild increase in extracellular DA of dialysates samples in the NA (132+/-13% over basal levels at the peak). GTS (100 mg/kg; i.p.) had no effect on resting levels of extracelluar DA. However, an increase in accumbens DA release produced by systemic nicotine was completely blocked by systemic pre-treatment with GTS (100 mg/kg; i.p.). In addition, the effect of GTS on nicotine-induced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and immediate early gene expression in ventral tegmental area (VTA) or NA regions was examined. A single injection of nicotine increased TH mRNA level at VTA region. GTS, which did not affect the basal TH mRNA expression, attenuated nicotine-induced TH mRNA expression. Nicotine slightly increased both c-fos and c-jun mRNA level and GTS, which did not affect the basal c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression, further enhanced nicotine-induced c-fos and c-jun mRNA level at both VTA and NA regions. Our results suggest that GTS may have an inhibitory action against nicotine-induced DA release in NA region and TH mRNA expression in VTA region. GTS may exert an potentiative effect on both c-fos and c-jun mRNA expression at NA region through inhibiting the release of DA in NA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Research Center, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shim", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Won", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J K", "Initials": "JK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huh", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y H", "Initials": "YH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6M3C89ZY6R", "NameOfSubstance": "Nicotine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.16.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, fos"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, jun"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleus Accumbens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ventral Tegmental Area"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10771206", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00166-x", "S0378-8741(99)00166-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
