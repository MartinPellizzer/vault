It is often associated with some metabolic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. With increasing focus on the treatment of fatty liver, much attention has been paid to numerous medicinal herbs and dietary substances to provide a new strategy for NAFLD treatment. The natural active compounds from the herbs or diet have been studied as promising treatments for NAFLD. This study aimed to summarize the use and mechanism of action of natural active compounds in the treatment of NAFLD in the recent 10 years. An updated search was conducted on the PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases from 2006 (for studies on silibinin, resveratrol, curcumin, and berberine compounds since 2010). Fifty-nine active compounds for NAFLD treatment were presented in detail in textual form and tabular form according to their chemical classification."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Liver Diseases, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Baoshan District Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanghai, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Digestive Diseases and Nutrition Center, Department of Pediatrics, The State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, United States."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Lixin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Liver Diseases, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Clinical Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Liver Diseases, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Clinical Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "E-institute of Shanghai Municipal Education Committee, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Yi-Yang", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Liver Diseases, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Clinical Medicine, Shanghai, 201203, China."}], "LastName": "Feng", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28925892", "10.2174/1381612823666170918120643", "CPD-EPUB-85820"]}}]}
