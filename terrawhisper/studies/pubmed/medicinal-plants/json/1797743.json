Sairei-to was administered in various doses (100,200,500 mg/kg B.W.) orally for 8 days after the initial injection of PAN. Proteinuria and serum triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in the sairei-to-treated groups showed a morphological improvement in the kidney over the PAN group. We found 500 mg/kg B.W. of sairei-to to be the most effective dose. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity was significantly elevated in the serum but not changed in the urine of sairei-to-treated groups pretreated with PAN. The normal control fed with 500 mg/kg B.W. of sairei-to showed a significant increase in serum SOD-like activity. The urinary prostanoid levels in the PAN group were lower than those in the normal and sairei-to-treated groups. These results support our hypothesis that sairei-to has effects on the elevation of SOD-like activity and on the synthesis of prostanoid in PAN-induced nephrosis, and that these effects are responsible for the mechanism of action of sairei-to."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hiroshima University School of Medicine, Japan."}], "LastName": "Joarder", "ForeName": "Z H", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ogawa", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yorioka", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamakido", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hiroshima J Med Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0421060", "ISSNLinking": "0018-2052"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "58-60-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Puromycin Aminonucleoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Nephrotic Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Puromycin Aminonucleoside"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1797743"]}}]}
