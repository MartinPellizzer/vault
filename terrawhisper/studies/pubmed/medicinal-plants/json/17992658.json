Women who reported use of herbal drugs were compared to all women giving birth during the period. Outcome variables were prematurity, birth weight, Apgar score, number of infants in delivery and congenital malformations.", "Among the 860 215 women in the register, 787 (0.9%) reported use of herbal drugs during early pregnancy. The most frequently used herbal drugs were Floradix (iron-rich herbs), ginseng and valerian. Use of such drugs was independently associated with high maternal age, normal weight and 14-15 years of education. Risk factors for valerian differed from those for other herbal drugs, for example with respect to maternal smoking and country of birth. Concomitant drug use was common and the most frequently used drugs were multivitamins, folic acid, cardiovascular drugs (mainly antihypertensive drugs), non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics and psycholeptics. None of the infant characteristics studied were influenced significantly by the mother's use of the examined herbal drugs during early pregnancy.", "The most commonly reported herbal drugs used during pregnancy were Floradix (iron-rich herbs), ginseng and valerian. No signs of unfavourable effect on pregnancy outcome were seen. The number of exposures, however, was low and therefore effects on rare outcomes (e.g. specific malformations) cannot be excluded."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Centre for Pharmacy, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. lone.holst@farm.uib.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Holst", "ForeName": "Lone", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nordeng", "ForeName": "Hedvig", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Haavik", "ForeName": "Svein", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf", "NlmUniqueID": "9208369", "ISSNLinking": "1053-8569"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Iron Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apgar Score"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Birth Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Congenital Abnormalities"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Iron Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Age"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Premature Birth"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Registries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sweden"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Valerian"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17992658", "10.1002/pds.1527"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
