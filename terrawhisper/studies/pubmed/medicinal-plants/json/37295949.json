The highly accurate molecular visualization detection technology enables qualitative and quantitative analyses of biologic tissues or cells scanned by mass spectrometry in situ, extracting known and unknown multiple compounds, and simultaneously assessing relative contents of targeting molecules by monitoring their molecular ions and pinpointing the spatial locations of those molecules distributed. Five mass spectrometric imaging techniques and their characteristics are introduced in the review, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, laser ablation electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometry-based techniques provide the possibility for spatial metabolomics with the capability of high throughput and precision detection. The approaches have been widely employed to spatially image not only metabolome of endogenous amino acids, peptides, proteins, neurotransmitters, and lipids but also the disposition of exogenous chemicals, such as pharmaceutical agents, environmental pollutants, toxicants, natural products, and heavy metals. The techniques also provide us with spatial distribution imaging of analytes in single cells, tissue microregions, organs, and whole animals. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The review article includes an overview of five commonly used mass spectrometers for spatial imaging and describes the advantages and disadvantages of each. Examples of the technology applications cover drug disposition, diseases, and omics. Technical aspects of relative and absolute quantification by mass spectrometric imaging and challenges for future new applications are discussed as well. The reviewed knowledge may benefit the development of new drugs and provide a better understanding of biochemical processes related to physiology and diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, P.R.
