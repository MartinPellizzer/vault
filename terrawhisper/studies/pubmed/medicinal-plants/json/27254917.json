HPLC method was used to determine the concentrations of probe drugs in rat plasma, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by DAS3.0. The effect of raw and processed Phellodendri Cortex on cytochrome P450 were judged indirectly by the pharmacokinetic parameters.", "Compared with the blank control group, the t\u00bd significantly increased of theophylline in raw and processed with salt-water group.

Meanwhile, it also can change the activities of cytochrome P450 after processed with rice-wine and salt-water. The Phellodendri Cortex processed with rice-wine can reduce the inhibitory effect of CYP1A2 and enhance induction of CYP3A4, it provides reference and basis to make an interpretation about Phellodendri Cortex processed with rice-wine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Peng-peng", "Initials": "PP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Tian-zhu", "Initials": "TZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochromes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Isoforms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyp1a2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyp3a2 protein, rat"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochromes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phellodendron"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Isoforms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27254917"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
