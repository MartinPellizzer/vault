Embryo abortion caused the lack of resources. Polyamine promoted its flowering and stress resistance in our previous study. But the mechanism remains unclear. The WRKY transcription factor family has been linked to a variety of biological processes in plants. In this study, two WRKY TFs (ArWRKY5 and ArWRKY20) of A. roxburghii, which showed significant response to Spd treatment, were identified and functionally analyzed. Tissue specific expression analyzation showed both of them mostly present in the flower. And ArWRKY5 expressed highest in the flower bud stage (-1 Flowering), while ArWRKY20 showed the highest expression in earlier flower bud stage (-2 Flowering) and the expression gradually decreased with flowering. The transcriptional activation activity assay and subcellular localization revealed that ArWRKY5 and ArWRKY20 were located in the nucleus and ArWRKY20 showed transcriptional activity. The heterologous expression of ArWRKY5 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed earlier flowering, while overexpression of ArWRKY20 delayed flowering. But the OE-ArWRKY20 lines had a robust body shape and a very significant increase in the number of rosette leaves. Furthermore, stamens and seed development were positively regulated by these two ArWRKYs. These results indicated that ArWRKY5 and ArWRKY20 not only play opposite roles in the floral development, but also regulate the plant growth and seed development in A. thaliana. But their specific biological functions and mechanism in A. roxburghii need to be investigated further."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
