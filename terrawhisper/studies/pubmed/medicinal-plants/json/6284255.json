The main results are that the bilayers are in a fluid state in the range from -- 5 to 50 degrees C, in the presence as well as in the absence of calcium, and that misleading conclusions may be derived with the perylene probe. The effects of pH and Ca2+/H+ interaction on the microviscosity were studied. In the absence of calcium pH increase fluidizes the bilayers ; when Ca2+ is present the microviscosity is constant over a large pH range. Calculations using the Gouy-Chapman theory suggest that the pH-induced microviscosity changes are controlled by the content in phosphadidylserine, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid of the extracts. Similarly the rigidifying effect of Ca2+ seems to be related to the content in these phospholipids. These hypothesis were confirmed by modifying the content of the extracts in these phospholipids. It is proposed that the behaviour of the two studied extracts results from the high insaturation of their fatty acids, which is typical of biological membranes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rossignol", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grignon", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grignon", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Biochimie", "NlmUniqueID": "1264604", "ISSNLinking": "0300-9084"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1720-32-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Diphenylhexatriene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5QD5427UN7", "NameOfSubstance": "Perylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diphenylhexatriene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Bilayers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Fluidity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Perylene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viscosity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6284255", "10.1016/s0300-9084(82)80493-8", "S0300-9084(82)80493-8"]}}]}
