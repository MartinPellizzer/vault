The emergence of advanced technologies in the field of drug discovery and development has helped in isolating various bioactive phytochemicals and developing them as drugs. Owing to their significant pharmacological benefits and minimum adverse effects, they not only serve as good candidates for therapeutics themselves but also help in the identification and development of related drug like molecules against various metabolic and infectious diseases. The ever-increasing diversity, severity and incidence of infectious diseases has resulted in an exaggerated mortality and morbidity levels. Geno-proteomic mutations in microbes, irrational prescribing of antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance and human population explosion, all call for continuous efforts to discover and develop alternated therapeutic options against the microbes. This review article describes the pharmacoinformatics tools and methods which are currently used in the discovery of bioactive phytochemicals, thus making the process more efficient and effective. The pharmacological aspects of the drug discovery and development process have also been reviewed with reference to the <i>in silico</i> activities. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
