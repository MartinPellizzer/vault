To compare the effect of cell source on the osteogenic differentiation potential, buccal fat pad-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BFP-MSCs), bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs) with different accessibility in time and region, were cultured on bioceramic (Bio-Oss<sup>\u00ae</sup>) coated electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold (PCL-Bio). After scaffold characterization, stem cells proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were investigated by MTT and Alizarin red staining, alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium content and gene expression assays. Proliferation rate of the stem cells was not significantly different with each other, only USSCs showed significantly lower proliferation rate while cultured on PCL-Bio; although, PCL-Bio showed better proliferation support in comparison with tissue culture plate and PCL. Mineralization of the BM-MSCs was significantly higher than others, while BFP-MSCs were close to it. Highest ALP activity was detected in BFP-MSCs cultured on PCL-Bio. USSCs demonstrated higher gene expression level in three genes, although differences were not huge compared to others. According to the results and due to the availability, facilitated preparation procedure and less patients suffering, BFP-MSCs have a better choice than BM-MSCs and USSCs for use in bone tissue engineering."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Stem Cell Technology Research Center , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Fatemeh Sadat", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Dietary Supplements and Probiotics Research Centre, Alborz University of Medical Sciences , Karaj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleimanifar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Urogenital Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Tissue Engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ardeshirylajimi", "ForeName": "Abdolreza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Laboratory for Stem Cell Research & Regenerative Medicine, Chair of Oman's Medicinal Plants & Marine Natural Products , University of Nizwa , Nizwa , Oman."}], "LastName": "Vakilian", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Sarem Cell Research Center (SCRC), Sarem Women's Hospital , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mossahebi-Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Majid", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Stem Cell Technology Research Center , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Enderami", "ForeName": "Seyed Ehsan", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Tissue Engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khojasteh", "ForeName": "Arash", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Biology , Islamic Azad University , Pishva , Iran."}], "LastName": "Zare Karizi", "ForeName": "Shohreh", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Artif Cells Nanomed Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101594777", "ISSNLinking": "2169-1401"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyesters"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24980-41-4", "NameOfSubstance": "polycaprolactone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ceramics"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanofibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyesters"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Stem Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30688102", "10.1080/21691401.2018.1553785"]}}]}
