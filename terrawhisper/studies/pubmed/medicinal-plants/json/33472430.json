They are the main active ingredient of many medicinal plants and have a wide range of pharmacological effects. Traditional production of triterpenoid saponins, directly extracted from cultivated plants, cannot meet the rapidly growing demand of pharmaceutical industry. Microorganisms with triterpenoid saponins production ability (especially <i>Agrobacterium</i> genus) and biotransformation ability, such as fungal species in <i>Armillaria</i> and <i>Aspergillus</i> genera and bacterial species in <i>Bacillus</i> and Intestinal microflora, represent a valuable source of active metabolites. With the development of synthetic biology, engineering microorganisms acquired more potential in terms of triterpenoid saponins production. This review focusses on potential mechanisms and the high yield strategies of microorganisms with inherent production or biotransformation ability of triterpenoid saponins. Advances in the engineering of microorganisms, such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Yarrowia lipolytica</i>, and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, for the biosynthesis triterpenoid saponins <i>de novo</i> have also been reported. Strategies to increase the yield of triterpenoid saponins in engineering microorganisms are summarized following four aspects, that is, introduction of high efficient gene, optimization of enzyme activity, enhancement of metabolic flux to target compounds, and optimization of fermentation conditions. Furthermore, the challenges and future directions for improving the yield of triterpenoid saponins biosynthesis in engineering microorganisms are discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Juan", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Junping", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Luqi", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Systems Bioengineering, Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Wenyuan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8505177", "ISSNLinking": "0738-8551"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yarrowia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33472430", "10.1080/07388551.2020.1869691"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
