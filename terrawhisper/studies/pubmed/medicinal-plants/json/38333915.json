The compounds belong to four categories as follow: Phenolic, Flavonoid, Terpenoid, and Alkaloid compounds. In the phenol groups, the most effective compounds are scutellarin (suppressor of COVID-19 virus), thymol and carvacrol (the most inhibitory effect on COVID-19 virus), in the flavonoid groups, hesperdin (a strong inhibitor on COVID-19), in the terpenoids, methyl tanshinonate and sojil COVID-19 inhibitory effect) and 1,8-cineol (COVID-19 inhibitory effect) and in the last group, niglidine and quinoline alkaloid compounds (COVID-19 inhibitory effect) have been identified and introduced. These compounds have shown promising results due to their structure and effective mechanisms on COVID-19, so it can be an idea for researchers in this field to try to produce drugs by using natural compounds against the COVID-19 and Corona viruses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6586-1854"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology and Plant Protection (Microbiology), Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ketebchi", "ForeName": "Saghar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0683-755X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Shiraz Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Papari Moghadamfard", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "14"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38333915", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2309322"]}}]}
