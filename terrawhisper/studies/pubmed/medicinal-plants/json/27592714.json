The effect of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and nutrient solution containing NPK on the plant was proped. A 35-day pot experiment was performed in the laboratory and the pots were irrigated with Ni-contaminated solution combined or not with EDTA and NPK. The growth of plants was evaluated at the end of the experiment. The accumulation of Ni was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The obtained results indicate that the plant was able to survive with high Ni content. The growth and the concentrations of Ni in the plant tissues were less affected. In the absence of the amendments, Ni was accumulated in the stems and leaves. However, the addition of NPK significantly reduced Ni concentration in the stems and leaves. The application of EDTA enhanced Ni uptake in roots. The translocation factor (TF) was greater than 1, which categorizes A. donax L. as a great candidate for Ni phytoextraction. A. donax L. is suitable for phytoremediation of Ni. This investigation contributes to the studies on the potential of phytoremediation technologies in Algeria."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Bioconversion Microbiological Engineering and Sanitary Safety (LBMESS) , University of Mascara , Mascara , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Atma", "ForeName": "Wafa", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Bioconversion Microbiological Engineering and Sanitary Safety (LBMESS) , University of Mascara , Mascara , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Larouci", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Bioconversion Microbiological Engineering and Sanitary Safety (LBMESS) , University of Mascara , Mascara , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Meddah", "ForeName": "Boumedienne", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Laboratory of Bioconversion Microbiological Engineering and Sanitary Safety (LBMESS) , University of Mascara , Mascara , Algeria."}], "LastName": "Benabdeli", "ForeName": "Kh\u00e9loufi", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry , Facult\u00e9 de Pharmacie , Amiens Cedex 1, France."}], "LastName": "Sonnet", "ForeName": "Pascal", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chelating Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertilizers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7OV03QG267", "NameOfSubstance": "Nickel"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9G34HU7RV0", "NameOfSubstance": "Edetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algeria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Chelating Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Edetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fertilizers"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nickel"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27592714", "10.1080/15226514.2016.1225291"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
