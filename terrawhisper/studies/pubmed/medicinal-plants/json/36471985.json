It has a wealth of names, such as Rousongrong, Heisiming, Dijing, and Dayun. The definition on the original plants which are parasitic and distributed in the unique environments in remote areas has been confusing, resulting in the emergence of various counterfeits and substitutes. Moreover, the records on the property, flavor, tropism, and indications of CH are also different. In order to further explore the cultural connotation and medicinal value of CH and further clarify its source and harvesting and processing methods, this study conducted further classical literature research on its name, harvesting and processing, property and flavor, meridian tropism, efficacy and clinical use, and textual research on its source and habitats, providing a reference for research, clinical medication, development and utilization, and industry development of CH."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural and Biomimetic Drugs, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peking University Beijing 100191, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Publications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36471985", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220711.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
