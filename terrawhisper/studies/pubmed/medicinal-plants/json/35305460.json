With the ammonia concentration increasing, the activity of Helicobacter pylori has got an obvious enhancement and leads to mucosal damage in the stomach, gastroduodenal infection, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. The infectious diseases caused by Helicobacter pylori can be controlled to a certain extent by inhibiting urease activity with urease inhibitors. Hence, studies of urease inhibitors have attracted great attention all over the world and a variety of effective urease inhibitors have been synthesized in recent years. In this review, we will draw summaries for these inhibitors including urease inhibitory activity, inhibition kinetics, structure-activity relationship, and molecular docking. The collected information is expected to provide rational guidance and effective strategy to develop novel, potent, and safe urease inhibitors for better practical applications in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.
