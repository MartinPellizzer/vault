Different from the traditional direct oxidation of indole \"N-H\" group by excess amount of metal salts, a copper-catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction is developed for the formation of the radical pyrrolidinoindoline intermediate in the current strategy. The robustness and practicality of this methodology is demonstrated by the step-economic, divergent total synthesis of natural products (\u00b1)-folicanthine and <i>meso</i>-folicanthine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zhi-Yao", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1299-9267"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, Huaxi Avenue South, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Jun-Rong", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Rui-An", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Qin", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8188-1561"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, The Key laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academy of Science, Guiyang 550014, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, Huaxi Avenue South, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Wei-Dong", "Initials": "WD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tryptamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6DPT9AB2NK", "NameOfSubstance": "indoline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "789U1901C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Copper"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Copper"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cyclization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimerization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tryptamines"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34709032", "10.1021/acs.joc.1c02277"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
