On the one hand there is a relatively harmless pattern of use (coca leaf chewing) in the countries concerned which minimizes the drug's most hazardous properties. On the other hand the region suffers from some of the most severe cocaine-related problems to be observed anywhere: (a) easy access to the newer, highly toxic preparations of the drug (such as coca paste) and a rapid growth in the number of new users; (b) the abandonment of certain traditional and essential agricultural activities in favour of the more profitable coca leaf production; (c) the severe ecological damage being caused in the coca growing areas; and (d) the establishment of a powerful coca trade economy which is subverting the very fabric of society and is creating corruption, lawless violence and political anarchy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada."}], "LastName": "Negrete", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Ciba Found Symp", "NlmUniqueID": "0356636", "ISSNLinking": "0300-5208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "I5Y540LHVR", "NameOfSubstance": "Cocaine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cocaine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "South America"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}], "NumberOfReferences": "22"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1638920", "10.1002/9780470514245.ch4"]}}]}
