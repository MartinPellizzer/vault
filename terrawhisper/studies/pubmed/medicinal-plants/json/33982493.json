It is a special medicinal material and extremely scarce in Huoshan county, Anhui province. At present, D. huoshanense has been greatly protected, which also makes it possible to industrialize relying on tissue culture and artificial cultivation technology. Three main planting methods were utilized for cultivating D. huoshanense including facility cultivation, under forest cultivation and simulative habitat cultivation. Firstly, the three cultivation modes and technical characteristics of D. huoshanense were compared and analyzed, and it was found that the ecological environment of D. huoshanense cultivated in the simulated environment was closer to that of wild D. huoshanense. Secondly, based on comparing the characters and quality of three cultivation modes, the results showed that the shape of D. huoshanense cultivated in simulated environment was more similar to that of &quot;grasshopper thigh&quot; recorded in Bencao Jing Jizhu, and its quality was better than that of facilities and under forest cultivation. The comprehensive benefit comparison of three modes showed that the simulated cultivation had high income, the lowest input-output ratio and significant economic benefit. The quality of cultivated D. huoshanense was further evaluated from four aspects of &quot;excellent environment&quot; &quot;excellent shape&quot; &quot;high quality&quot; &quot;excellent effect&quot;, which summarized the comprehensive advantages of simulative habitat cultivation of D. huoshanense as follows: the original habitat and site environment of simulated wild D. huoshanense, the closer shape to the wild, the more content of main medicinal components, and higher economic benefit and better efficacy. The quality of D. huoshanense was improved by the use of simulative habitat cultivation, which has practical significance to guide its large-scale cultivation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Yi", "ForeName": "Shan-Yong", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory and Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "Chuan-Zhi", "Initials": "CZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Xiang-Wen", "Initials": "XW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Hai-Bo", "Initials": "HB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Shu-Lan", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory and Breeding Base of Dao-di Herbs, National Resource Center for Chinese Meteria Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological and Pharmaceutical Engineering, West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China Anhui Engineering Laboratory for Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources,West Anhui University Lu'an 237012, China."}], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Bang-Xing", "Initials": "BX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Forests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "53"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33982493", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210225.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
