(PS), belonging to Piperaceae family, is an edible plant with medicinal properties. It is traditionally used by the Malays to treat headache and boost memory. Pharmacological studies revealed that PS exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-acetylcholinesterase, and anti-depressant-like effects. In view of this, the present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory actions of PS and its potential neuroprotective effects against beta-amyloid (A\u03b2)-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity.", "The inhibitory effects of hexane (L<sub>HXN</sub>), dichloromethane (L<sub>DCM</sub>), ethyl acetate (L<sub>EA</sub>) and methanol (L<sub>MEOH</sub>) extracts from leaves of PS on A\u03b2-induced production and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in BV-2 microglial cells were assessed using colorimetric assay with Griess reagent, ELISA kit and real-time RT-PCR respectively. Subsequently, MTT reduction assay was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of PS leaf extracts against A\u03b2-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The levels of tau proteins phosphorylated at threonine 231 (pT231) and total tau proteins (T-tau) were determined using ELISA kits.", "Polar extracts of PS leaves (L<sub>EA</sub> and L<sub>MEOH</sub>) reduced the A\u03b2-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) in BV-2 cells by downregulating the mRNA expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production could be due to the free radical scavenging activity of the extracts. In addition, conditioned media from A\u03b2-induced BV-2 cells pre-treated with L<sub>EA</sub> and L<sub>MEOH</sub> protected SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. Further mechanistic study suggested that the neuroprotective effects were associated with the downregulation of phosphorylated tau proteins.", "The present study suggests that polar extracts of PS leaves confer neuroprotection against A\u03b2-induced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation through their anti-inflammatory actions and could be a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V.
