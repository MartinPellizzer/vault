Thus, in the current study, we evaluate the toxicological effects of hydroalcoholic extract of Eugenia brasiliensis (HEEb) and its antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity.", "We used male, and female Swiss mice. Acute toxicity study was performed following the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline 425, and subacute toxicity was assessed following OECD guideline 407. We observed behavioral responses, in addition to hematological, biochemical, and histological evaluations. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity of HEEb were assessed using the Carrageenan-induced mechanical allodynia and paw edema model. Mechanical allodynia, levels of inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative damage were evaluated.", "The treatment with HEEb was not able to generate important toxicological alterations. Moreover, doses of 100 and 300\u00a0mg/kg of HEEb were able to reduce mechanical allodynia, paw edema, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6), decrease malondialdehyde and increase superoxide dismutase enzyme activity in the paw.", "This study demonstrated that HEEb does not present important toxic effects. Additionally, an important antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potential were observed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
