Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> is the most toxic compound among aflatoxins and has been classified as group 1 carcinogenic to humans, especially in liver cancer. Herein, an ambient mass spectrometric method was developed for rapid characterization of trace aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> in peanuts.", "Direct electrospray probe tandem mass spectrometry (DEP-MS/MS) was used to detect aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> in peanuts. To avoid the matrix effect, the aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> in the samples was extracted and concentrated by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode to monitor the intact molecular ion (m/z 313, MH<sup>+</sup> ) and product ion (m/z 241) of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> using multiple reaction monitoring.", "Since no clean-up procedure of the sample was required, the sampling step and the subsequent mass spectrometric detection of the aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> was completed in less than 5\u00a0min. The limit of detection of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> is at the sub-ppb level. The results obtained by DEP-MS/MS were also validated by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Recovery of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> in the sample was evaluated by analyzing spiked aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> with LC/MS/MS to be 85% and DEP-MS/MS to be 84%.", "DEP-MS/MS combined with a simple dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure was successfully used for the quantitative analysis of AFB<sub>1</sub> in nut samples. Due to its high efficiency, it is promising in providing important toxicological information for food safety in the real world.
