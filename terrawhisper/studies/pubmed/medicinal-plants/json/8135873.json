The separated p-nitrophenyl esters were individually hydrolysed by potassium hydroxide in acetone-water at room temperature to 8 diterpene acids of the pimarane and abietane groups: pimaric acid (8(14),15-pimaradien-18-oic acid) (1), levopimaric acid (8(14),12-abietadien-18-oic acid) (2), palustric acid (8,13-abietadien-18-oic acid) (3), neobietic acid (8(14),13(15)-abietadien-18-oic acid) (4), abietic acid (7,13-abietadien-18-oic acid) (5), dehydroabietic acid (8,11,13-abietatrien-18-oic acid) (6), 7-oxodehydroabietic acid (7-oxo-8,11,13-abietatrien-18-oic acid) (7) and 7 alpha-hydroxydehydroabietic acid (7 alpha-hydroxy-8,11,13-abietatrien-18-oic acid) (8). The structure (and stereochemistry) of the diterpene acids were substantiated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (proton and carbon-13, one and two dimensional), by mass spectrometry (electron impact and methane chemical ionization) and by rotation measurements. The 8 diterpene acids were tested for their ability to inhibit the aggregation of washed rabbit platelets induced by platelet activating factor (PAF), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and by calcium ionophore A23187. With platelet aggregation induced by the latter two agonists, activities comparable with or higher than linolenic acid were given by the first 4 acids. With aggregation induced by PAF, the first 3 acids show activity, but at a level significantly lower than that of linolenic acid. Levopimaric acid has the highest activity among the diterpene acids tested. It is proposed that this activity is related to the folded shape of the molecule."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Australia."}], "LastName": "Cheung", "ForeName": "H T", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smal", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Activating Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37H9VM9WZL", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcimycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "61D2G4IYVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine Diphosphate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcimycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Activating Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8135873"]}}]}
