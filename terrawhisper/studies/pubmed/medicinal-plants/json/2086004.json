The treatment was started 45 minutes after coronary occlusion and stopped one hour after reperfusion. 24 hours later, the dogs were killed and the extent of myocardial necrosis was determined histologically. The LVEDP, arterial pressure and heart rate were markedly lower in the ginsenosides group. Electrocardiographic findings of myocardial ischemia were significantly improved in the ginsenosides group. 8 controls developed malignant arrhythmia after reperfusion, but none in ginsenosides group. The myocardial ultrastructure can be protected by ginsenosides during the period of ischemia and reperfusion. The infarct size in saline group was 22.7 +/- 3.2% while in the ginsenosides group it was 5.2 +/- 1.3% (P less than 0.05). These results show that ginsenosides can protect the ischemic myocardium and reperfusion injury of myocardium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, PLA General Hospital."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "J B", "Initials": "JB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "16210490R", "ISSNLinking": "0578-1426"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2086004"]}}]}
