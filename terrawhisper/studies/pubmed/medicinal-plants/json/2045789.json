This work was initiated as a step towards elucidation of the significance of this putative gene. Sequence data on RNA-2 suggest that a 29,600 Mr (29.6K) protein is translated from the ORF in question. Hybridization with ORF-specific probes on Northern blots with RNA from infected plants showed that PEBV synthesizes a subgenomic RNA encoding CP (RNA-2a) with a size of 3000 nucleotides (nt) and that a putative subgenomic RNA (RNA-2b) encoding the 29.6K protein appears to have a size of 1600 nt. This is 300 nt less than the size predicted from the sequencing data. For antibody production, a cDNA fragment harbouring 85% of the 29.6K ORF was cloned into the pUEX3 expression vector. The resulting plasmid expresses the 29.6K protein as a fusion protein with beta-galactosidase and this protein was used for raising antiserum containing specific anti-29.6K protein antibodies. By using these antibodies on immunoblots it was demonstrated that the 29.6K protein is expressed in infected plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Danish Research Service for Plant and Soil Science, Lyngby."}], "LastName": "Johnsen", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rasmussen", "ForeName": "O F", "Initials": "OF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Albrechtsen", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borkhardt", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blotting, Northern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Biosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Restriction Mapping"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2045789", "10.1099/0022-1317-72-6-1223"]}}]}
