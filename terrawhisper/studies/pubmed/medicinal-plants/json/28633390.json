For both plants and animals, these regulatory events were previously considered to take place in cytoplasm, as mature miRNAs were observed to be exported to the cytoplasm for Argonaute (AGO) loading and subsequent target binding. Recently, this notion was challenged by increasing pieces of evidence in the animal cells that uncovered the nuclear importation and action of the AGO-associated miRNAs. The nuclear-localized regulatory mode was also reported for the plant miRNAs. However, evidence is still lacking to show the universality and conservation of the miRNA-mediated regulation in the plant nuclei. Here, we introduced a bioinformatics workflow for genome-wide investigation of miRNA-guided, cleavage-based regulation of the nascent nuclear transcripts. Facilitated by the tool package PmiRNTSA (Plant microRNA-mediated nascent transcript slicing analyzer), plant biologists could perform a comprehensive search for the miRNA slicing sites located within the introns or the exon-intron/intron-exon junctions of the target transcripts, which are supported by degradome sequencing data. The results enable the researchers to examine the co-transcriptional regulatory model of the miRNAs for a specific plant species. Moreover, a case study was performed to search for the slicing sites located within the exon-intron/intron-exon junctions in two model plants. A case study was performed to show the feasibility and reliability of our workflow. Together, we hope that this work could inspire much more innovative research efforts to expand the current understanding of the miRNA action modes in plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Dongliang", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Hunan Agricultural University."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Zhonghai", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Huzhou University."}], "LastName": "Shao", "ForeName": "Chaogang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Xiaoxia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Taihe", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Zhihong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory for Genetic Improvement and Quality Control of Medicinal Plants, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Huizhong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Yijun", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Brief Bioinform", "NlmUniqueID": "100912837", "ISSNLinking": "1467-5463"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Exons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Introns"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA Splicing"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Workflow"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28633390", "10.1093/bib/bbx069", "3867941"]}}]}
