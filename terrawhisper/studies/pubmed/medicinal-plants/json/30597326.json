In this paper, we present an enzymatic screening assay and multiple biological evaluations for the identification of potential PDKs, especially PDK1 inhibitors. We identified 9 potential PDKs inhibitors from the screening of an in-house small molecule library, all of the identified inhibitors reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation. Among which, 4, 5, and 9 displayed the most potent PDKs inhibitory activities, with EC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.34, 1.4, and 1.6\u202f\u03bcM in an enzymatic assay, respectively. A kinase inhibition assay suggested that 4, 5, and 9 were pan-isoform PDK inhibitors, but more sensitive to PDK1. Meanwhile, the three compounds inhibited HSP90, with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.78, 3.58, and 2.70\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. The cell viability assay indicated that 4 inhibited all of the tested cancer cells proliferation, with a GC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.3\u202f\u03bcM against NCIH1975\u202fcell, but has little effect on human normal lung cell BEAS-2B cell. In the NCIH1975 xenograft models, 4 displayed strong antitumor activities at a dose of 10 and 20\u202fmg/kg, but with no negative effect on the mice weight. In addition, 4 decreased the ECAR and lactate formation, increased OCR and ROS level in NCIH1975 cancer cell, which could be used as a promising modulator to reprogram the glucose metabolic pathways in NCIH1975 cancer cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
