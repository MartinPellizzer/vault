Due to the emergence of multiple resistance, antibiotic treatments are rapidly becoming ineffective for the related infections. Natural products, especially those derived from plants, have been proven to be effective agents with unique antibacterial properties through different mechanisms. This review interprets the resistance mechanisms of MRSA with the aim to conquer public health threat. Further, recent researches about plant antimicrobials that showed remarkable antibacterial activity against MRSA are recorded, including the crude plant extracts and purified plant-derived bioactive compounds. Novel anti-MRSA modalities of plant antimicrobials such as alteration in efflux pump, inhibition of pyruvate kinase, and disturbance of quorum sensing in MRSA are also summarized which may be promising alternatives to antibacterial drug development in future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science and Nutrition, National Engineering Laboratory of Intelligent Food Technology and Equipment , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture , Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jiao", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science and Nutrition, National Engineering Laboratory of Intelligent Food Technology and Equipment , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture , Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Donghong", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering , Arizona State University , Tempe , AZ , USA."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Xiaojun", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Graduate School of Agricultural Science , Hokkaido University , Sapporo , Japan."}], "LastName": "Koseki", "ForeName": "Shigenobu", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science and Nutrition, National Engineering Laboratory of Intelligent Food Technology and Equipment , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture , Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Shiguo", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science and Nutrition, National Engineering Laboratory of Intelligent Food Technology and Equipment , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture , Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}], "LastName": "Ye", "ForeName": "Xingqian", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8403-5344"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Food Science and Nutrition, National Engineering Laboratory of Intelligent Food Technology and Equipment , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture , Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing , Hangzhou , Zhejiang , China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Tian", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.40", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyruvate Kinase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Pyruvate Kinase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Quorum Sensing"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcal Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30501508", "10.1080/10408398.2018.1541865"]}}]}
