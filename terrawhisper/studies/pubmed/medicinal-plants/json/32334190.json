The structures of the new compounds were elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, and the structures of the known compounds were established by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those of related metabolites. The antiaging activities of all isolates were evaluated using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. The results showed that 10 compounds could protect C. elegans by extending its lifespan. Compound 1 possessed the most potent effect in the anti-heat stress assay and significantly attenuated aging-related decreases in the pumping and bending of the nematodes in the healthspan assay. Molecular docking studies suggested that compound 1 was bound to the DNA binding domain of HSF-1 and promoted the conformation of HSF-1, thus strengthening the interaction between the HSF-1 and related DNA. GLN49, ASN-74, and LYS-80 of the binding region might be the key amino residues during the interaction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
