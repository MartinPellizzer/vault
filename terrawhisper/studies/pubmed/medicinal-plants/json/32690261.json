The antivirulence strategy with the benefite of alleviating the drug resistance becomes the focus of research. In this study, 22 quorum sensing inhibitors were synthesized by mimicking the structure of autoinducer and acinetobactin and up to 34% biofilm inhibition was observed with 5u. The biofilm inhibition effect was further demonstrated with extracellular polysaccharides inhibition and synergism with Gentamycin sulphate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
