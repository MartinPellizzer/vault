Until now, studies on the effects of various phytochemicals on CYP2D6 activity in vivo have been very rare. Gallic acid and ellagic acid are natural polyphenols which are widely distributed in fruits and medicinal plants. In the present study, the effects of gallic acid and ellagic acid pretreatment on intestinal transport and oral bioavailability of metoprolol were investigated.", "The intestinal transport of metoprolol was assessed by conducting an in situ single pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) study. The bioavailability study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of orally administered metoprolol in rats.", "After pretreatment with gallic acid and ellagic acid, no significant change in effective permeability of metoprolol was observed at the ileum part of rat intestine. A significant improvement in the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration-time profile (AUC) and decrease in clearance were observed in rats pretreated with gallic acid and ellagic acid.", "Gallic acid and ellagic acid significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of metoprolol by inhibiting CYP2D6-mediated metabolism in the rat liver. Hence, adverse herbal-drug interactions may result with concomitant ingestion of gallic acid and ellagic acid supplements and drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates. The clinical assessment of these interactions should be further investigated in human volunteers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Athukuri", "ForeName": "Bhargavi Latha", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Neerati", "ForeName": "Prasad", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Metab Pers Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101653409", "ISSNLinking": "2363-8915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19YRN3ZS9P", "NameOfSubstance": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GEB06NHM23", "NameOfSubstance": "Metoprolol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6 Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ellagic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Metoprolol"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27875319", "10.1515/dmpt-2016-0029", "/j/dmdi.ahead-of-print/dmpt-2016-0029/dmpt-2016-0029.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
