Dopaminergic neuron failure in the substantia nigra is a pathological sign connected with the motor shortfall of PD. Due to their low teratogenic and adverse effect potential, medicinal herbs have emerged as a promising therapy option for preventing and curing PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanism through which natural compounds provide neuroprotection against PD remains unknown. While testing compounds in vertebrates such as mice is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) may offer an appealing alternative because they are vertebrates and share many of the same characteristics as humans. Zebrafish are commonly used as animal models for studying many human diseases, and their molecular history and bioimaging properties are appropriate for the study of PD. However, a literature review indicated that only six plants, including <i>Alpinia oxyhylla, Bacopa monnieri, Canavalia gladiate, Centella asiatica, Paeonia suffruticosa</i>, and <i>Stachytarpheta indica</i> had been investigated as potential PD treatments using the zebrafish model. Only <i>C. asiatica</i> and <i>B. monnieri</i> were found to have potential anti-PD activity. In addition to reviewing the current state of research in this field, these plants' putative mechanisms of action against PD are explored, and accessible assays for investigation are made."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9767-6255"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Research Center, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Chahardehi", "ForeName": "Amir Modarresi", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7524-3301"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Research Center, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Yasaman", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5836-8487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Malek Ashtar University of Technology (MUT), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cognitive Neuroscience Research Center, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naseh", "ForeName": "Iman", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269155", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5273"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Parkinson Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zebrafish"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dopaminergic Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "17"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36999188", "10.2174/1871527322666230330111712", "CNSNDDT-EPUB-130533"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
