In October 2023, severe powdery mildew were observed on <i>S. grosvenorii</i> in Guiyang City (26.50\u00b0N; 106.66\u00b0E), Guizhou Province, China. About 80 % of the plants in the greenhouse showed powdery mildew symptoms. Three infected plant samples were selected for morphological and molecular analysis (GZAAS 23-0801, GZAAS 23-0802 and GZAAS 23-0803). The voucher specimens are deposited in the Key Laboratory of Agricultural Biotechnology of Guizhou Province. The symptoms initially manifested as irregular to nearly circular, small yellow spots, with distinct depressions as well as surfaces covered in white mycelium. Over time, these spots gradually expanded and merged patches. In the final stages, the entire leaves turned into yellow and withered. Microscopic observations showed that fungal hyphae were septate, branched, and flexuous to straight and 5 to 9 \u00b5m wide, and appressoria were indistinct to slightly nipple-shaped. Conidia were hyaline and ellipsoid to oval with fibrosin bodies and measured 31 to 43 \u00d7 18 to 24 \u03bcm (n = 50) with a length/width ratio of 1.3 to 2.3. Conidiophores were unbranched, straight, 120 to 268 \u00d7 14 to 22 \u00b5m (n = 30), producing two to five immature conidia in chains. Foot cells of conidiophores were cylindrical, 39 to 84 \u00d7 8 to 14 \u03bcm (n = 30), followed by one to three short cells. Short cells were cylindrical, 12 to 32 \u00d7 8 to 15 \u03bcm (n = 50). The morphological characteristics were identical with the previous description of <i>Podosphaera xanthii</i> (Braun and Cook, 2012). Total DNA was extracted from conidia and mycelia by the Chelex method (Walsh et al., 1991). The ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) were amplified by using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al., 1990) and LSU1/LSU2 (Scholin et al., 1994), respectively. The ITS (OR825802, OR825803 and OR825804, respectively) and LSU (OR825805, OR825806 and OR825807, respectively) sequences of three isolates, were deposited in GenBank. The BLAST results revealed that both the ITS and LSU region sequence were 100% identical to those of <i>P. xanthii</i> (ITS: MF043939, MG754404 and KJ698669; LSU: OQ061319, AB936277and OP218411). Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and LSU sequences showed that our three isolates were clustered with <i>P. xanthii</i> (KX842351, LC270782 and LC270779) with high statistical support (ML/MP/BI: 100%/97%/1.00). Combined with their morphological characteristics, these three isolates were identified as <i>P. xanthii</i>. Pathogenicity tests were performed by gently brushing conidia onto the leaves of five healthy <i>S. grosvenorii</i> plants. Five non-inoculated plants were used as the control. All plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. One week after inoculation, similar symptoms were observed in the inoculated plants, whereas no symptoms occurred on the control plants. By microscopic observation, the fungus on the inoculated plants was morphologically identical to those on originally diseased plants. Powdery mildew caused by <i>P. xanthii</i> has been reported on <i>Vernonia cinerea</i> (Wu et al., 2023), <i>Vigna unguiculata</i> (Zhang et al., 2023), <i>Cucumis melo</i> (Meesam et al., 2023). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by <i>P. xanthii</i> on <i>S. grosvenorii</i> in Guizhou, China. The occurrence of powdery mildew on <i>S. grosvenorii</i> may pose a potential threat to its large-scale cultivation. The pathogen could become a threat to other Cucurbitaceae members in the future."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou University, 71206, Department of Plant Pathology, Agriculture College, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; panyintao725@163.com."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Yintao", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74721, Plant Protection Institute, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; gzzbshl@163.com."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74721, Plant Protection Institute, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; 1825480983@qq.com."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Xing-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 74721, Plant Protection Institute, Guiyang, Guizhou, China; gzwusp@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Shi-Ping", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38252090", "10.1094/PDIS-12-23-2561-PDN"]}}]}
