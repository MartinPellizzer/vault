Verte du Puy) in order to determine the effects of microgravity on the polarity of these cells. Seedlings were grown: (1) on the ground, (2) in microgravity, (3) on a 1 g centrifuge in space, (4) first in microgravity and then placed on a 1 g centrifuge for 3 h. Dry seeds were hydrated in space (except for the ground control) for 25 h in darkness at 22 degrees C in the Biorack facility developed by the European Space Agency. At the end of the experiment, the seedlings were photographed and fixed in glutaraldehyde in the Biorack glove box. The average shape of the statocytes and the location of endoplasmic reticulum, amyloplasts and nucleus in the cells were analysed in the four samples. By considering the cell shape, it appears that the morphology of the statocytes on the ground was different from that observed in the space samples. Cell polarity was similar in microgravity and in the centrifuged samples except for the distribution of the amyloplasts. These organelles were not distributed at random in near zero gravity, and they were more numerous in the proximal than in the distal half. Moreover, the statoliths were more voluminous in microgravity than in the centrifuged samples. The nucleus was closer to the cell center in the statocytes of roots grown in microgravity than in statocytes of roots grown in microgravity and then placed on the 1 g centrifuge for 3 h. It is hypothesized that the nucleus is attached to the cell periphery and that its location is dependent upon gravity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lab. de Cytologie Experimentale et Morphogenese Vegetale, Univ.
