Abundant studies have demonstrated that dysfunction or imbalance of gut microbiota is closely related to disease progression, including endocrine diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, etc. Herbal medicines have been applied to prevent and treat diseases worldwide for hundreds of years. Although the underlying mechanism seems to be complex, one of the important ones is through modulating gut microbiota. In this review, co-metabolism between herbal medicines and microbiota, as well as the potential pathways are summarized from most recent published papers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, Macao."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Tingting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, Macao."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhe", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Endocrinology, Zhuhai Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhuhai, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhilong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, Macao."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Youhua", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "100960531", "ISSNLinking": "1389-4501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Progression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Microbiome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32208116", "10.2174/1389450121666200324151530", "CDT-EPUB-105458"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
