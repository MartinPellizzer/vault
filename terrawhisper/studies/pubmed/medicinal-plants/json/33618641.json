This review aimed at congregating the application of different statistical designs (CCD/BBD) to optimize the Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) parameters for the recovery of various plant actives belonging to different categories.", "The literature published during the last decade in the various reputed databases (Web of Science, Pubmed, Scopus) was reviewed and compiled to reveal the role of response surface methodology in optimizing the influential parameters involved in the ultrasound assisted extraction of herbs.", "From the present investigations, it can be concluded that the different variables, such as sonication power, temperature, time, solute to solvent ratio are generally optimized in UAE of herbs. Moreover, it has also been evidenced from the review of published data that the flavonoids/phenolic acids (>50%) leads the race for the extraction of plants using sound waves. It can be said that the statistically designed UAE has a vast prospective in bringing about a green mutiny in the herbal drug industry and the modeling of various parameters shall be able to absolutely build up a complete drug innovation course (bench to bed)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Arya", "ForeName": "Ashwani", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Chahal", "ForeName": "Rubal", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Nanda", "ForeName": "Arun", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Kaushik", "ForeName": "Deepak", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biology Department, College of Science, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bin-Jumah", "ForeName": "May", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Southeast University, Banani, Dhaka-1213, Bangladesh."}], "LastName": "Rahman", "ForeName": "Md Habibur", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University, Ismailia 41522, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Daim", "ForeName": "Mohamed M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maharshi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Mittal", "ForeName": "Vineet", "Initials": "V"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Fractionation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sonication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultrasonic Waves"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "39"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33618641", "10.2174/1381612827666210222114441", "CPD-EPUB-114431"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
