Reaction of DHT with the enzyme produced a characteristic absorption peak at 320 nm and led to complete loss of the enzymatic activity at a low concentration of DHT. Amino acid analysis of DHT-modified urease showed that only cysteine residues reacted with the reagent and other amino acid residues such as tyrosine, histidine, and lysine did not. The enzymatic activity was protected against DHT-inactivation by the addition of substrate. On the other hand, when the cysteine residues were modified with DHT, the enzyme was not converted to polymeric forms. Furthermore, the binding ability of urease with hydroxamic acid, a specific urease inhibitor, was virtually unaffected by DHT-inactivation. These results indicate that cysteine residues are specifically modified by DHT with concomitant loss of enzymatic activity and polymerization ability, but are not essential for the binding of hydroxamic acid to the enzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakaguchi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitsui", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hase", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobashi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetrazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2260-28-8", "NameOfSubstance": "5-diazo-1H-tetrazole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.5.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Urease"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K848JZ4886", "NameOfSubstance": "Cysteine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Azoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cysteine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxamic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetrazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Urease"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6715313", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134636"]}}]}
