The influence of apigenin in DMSO, A/D (4:1), and propylene glycol/DMSO (PG/D, 4:1) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (TPA) induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was compared. Distant topical delivery of apigenin was conducted on abdominal skin and ODC activity was monitored in dorsal skin. Potential glucuronidation/sulfation of apigenin in intact skin was assessed by measuring isolated apigenin before and after enzyme hydrolysis with glucuronidase/sulfatase. The epidermal extracts from apigenin-treated SENCAR mice were analyzed for metabolites by HPLC.", "Apigenin (5 mumol) in A/D did not significantly reduce skin tumor incidence in contrast to previous data with DMSO. Inhibition of TPA-induced ODC by apigenin in three vehicles was in the order of DMSO > A/D > PG/D. TPA-induced ODC in dorsal skin was not inhibited by apigenin delivered from abdominal skin. The quantity of apigenin recovered from epidermal extract was not different before and after beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment. Metabolites were not observed in the HPLC profiles of epidermal extracts from apigenin treated mice.", "(a) The short-term TPA-induced ODC was validated for evaluating topical formulations of apigenin. (b) Topical delivery of apigenin should target the local skin tissue. (c) Glucuronidation/sulfation appeared not to be involved in apigenin's chemopreventive activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198, USA."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pinch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birt", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "P30 CA 36727", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8406521", "ISSNLinking": "0724-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Vehicles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1364PS73AF", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6DC9Q167V3", "NameOfSubstance": "Propylene Glycol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.17", "NameOfSubstance": "Ornithine Decarboxylase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred SENCAR"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ornithine Decarboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Vehicles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Propylene Glycol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Propylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mutat Res. 1979 Mar;66(3):223-40", "ArticleIdList": ["375081"]}, {"Citation": "Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;213:177-94", "ArticleIdList": ["3520587"]}, {"Citation": "Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 1;50(3):499-502", "ArticleIdList": ["2105157"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1972 Jul;128(4):901-11", "ArticleIdList": ["4638796"]}, {"Citation": "Toxicology. 1990 Nov;64(2):141-53", "ArticleIdList": ["2219136"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8899846", "10.1023/a:1016083613916"]}}]}
