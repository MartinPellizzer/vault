Four Cistanche species were found as Herba Cistanches in China herbal markets, including C. deserticola, C. tubulosa, C. salsa and C. sinensis. Phenylethanoid glycosides, particularly echinacoside and acteoside, are considered as active ingredients in Cistanche species. The contents of these compounds showed variation in different species and geographical sources. Standard chemical fingerprints were generated from each of four Cistanche species, which could be identification markers. In genetic analysis of Cistanche species, ninety-four inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and of which eight primers were found to be sufficient to distinguish different Cistanche species. As a result, the chemical fingerprint combined with the genetic fingerprint for distinction of Cistanche species could serve as markers for quality control of Herba Cistanches."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hai Ming", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Meng Yue", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao Bo", "Initials": "XB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fingerprinting"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Microsatellite Repeats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19122297", "10.1248/bpb.32.142", "JST.JSTAGE/bpb/32.142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
