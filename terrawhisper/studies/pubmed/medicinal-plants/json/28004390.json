The most important human percutaneous descriptors, i.e. logK<sub>p</sub> (logarithm of the water/skin partition coefficient) and logJ<sub>max</sub> (logarithm of the maximum flux of solutes penetrating the skin), of fatty acids and polyphenols were determined using both in vitro and in silico methods. For in vitro determination of human percutaneous absorption, micellar liquid chromatography based on hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, sodium dodecyl sulfate and polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether (Brij35) was used. Human percutaneous absorption was characterized by entirely new QSAR/QRAR models based on retention, lipophilic, steric and electronic data as well as on the linear free energy relationship parameters. Many different correlations between human skin absorption and different physicochemical parameters were performed, e.g. the in silico estimated logK<sub>p</sub> value was correlated with the retention parameter logk<sub>w</sub> (logarithm of the retention factor extrapolated to pure water) from the systems imitating a cutaneous environment (R<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u20090.92). Moreover, the influence of lipophilicity on percutaneous absorption was examined. The obtained correlation was excellent (R<sup>2</sup> \u2009=\u20090.95)."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9812-9114"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Planar Chromatography, Chair of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Stepnik", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Planar Chromatography, Chair of Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Malinowska", "ForeName": "Irena", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cetrimonium Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "368GB5141J", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N72LMW566G", "NameOfSubstance": "Brij 35"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z7FF1XKL7A", "NameOfSubstance": "Cetrimonium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cetrimonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cetrimonium Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "10", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28004390", "10.1002/bmc.3922"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
