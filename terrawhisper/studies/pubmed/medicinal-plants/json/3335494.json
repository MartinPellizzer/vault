The purified products appear to be free of contaminating proteases and exoglycosidases, and their substrate specificity has been explored with regard to both glycan and peptide structure of the substrates. The endoglycosidase appears to be specific for high mannose glycans; no hydrolysis of either hybrid or complex glycans has been observed. It shows limited activity with two intact glycoproteins, ribonuclease B and yeast invertase, and gives optimal rate with glycopeptides. Free glycan-Asn derivatives are poor substrates in comparison with glycopeptides or glycan-Asn derivatives where the alpha-amino group has been dansylated. The amidase will liberate both high mannose, hybrid, and asialo-complex glycans from both proteins and peptides, but many glycans in intact proteins or in long peptides are resistant to the amidase and become active as substrates only after further proteolytic cleavage. The best substrates appear to be those with the glycosylated asparagine no more than 4-5 residues in from either the NH2- or COOH-terminal end of the peptide. Sialylated glycans do not appear to be released by the amidase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77225."}], "LastName": "Yet", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wold", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM-31305", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycopeptides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycopeptides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3335494", "S0021-9258(19)57365-3"]}}]}
