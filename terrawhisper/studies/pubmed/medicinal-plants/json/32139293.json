A series of novel set of trisubstituted thiazole compounds (AR-17a to AR-27a) have synthesized and evaluated for their in-vitro and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activities. Synthesized trisubstituted thiazole compounds were also evaluated for their potential antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens causing infectious disease.", "The structures of synthesized compounds were characterized by FTIR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, Mass spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their in-vitro and in-vivo anti-inflammatory effects using the human red blood cell (HRBC) membrane stabilization method and a carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema model, respectively, Diclofenac sodium and Ibuprofen were used as standard drugs. The synthesized compounds AR-17atoAR-27a screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923) and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212) and the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC8739) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC9027) using ciprofloxacin and cefdinir as standard drugs.", "Compounds AR-17a and AR-27a elicited maximum anti-inflammatory activity, providing 59% and 61% protection at 20mg/kg, respectively, in the inflamed paw model. Among the tested compounds, AR-17a (6.25), (54) and AR-27a (1.56), (52) had the least minimum inhibitory concentration values and the highest zone of inhibition, indicating their marked antibacterial activities. The lowest conc. were observed at 1.56, 6.25\u03bcg/mL for inhibition of bacteria by most of the compounds.", "Novel set of trisubstituted thiazole compounds (AR-17a to AR-27a) have synthesized and characterized successfully. The preliminary screening revealed that these compounds possess promising anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities. In addition, the objective of the study was achieved with few of the promising structures like AR-17a to AR-27a, which are prove to be potential monotherapy candidates for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and bacterial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
