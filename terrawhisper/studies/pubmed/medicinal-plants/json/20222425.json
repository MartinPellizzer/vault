The decreased tendency has been found on activity of Ca(2+) -ATPase and SDH, only the Radix scutellariaeg group decreased the Ca(2+) -ATPase activity significantly (P < 0.05), the SDH activity was decreased high significantly by Radix scutellariae, Cortex Phellodendri, Radix Gentianae and significantly by Rhizoma Coptidis. The mRNA expression of UCP3 has been decreased high significantly by all five cold traditional Chinese medicine except Cortex Phellodendri group with the decreased tendency of UCP3 mRNA expression.", "The cold traditional Chinese medicine has the significant effects on the skeletal muscle energy metabolism by decreasing the utlization of the glucose and the activity of mitochondria SDH to reduce the production of ATP, and depressing the activity of Na(+)-K(+) -ATPase and Ca(2+) -ATPase to cut down the consumption of ATP, by decreasing the mRNA expression of UCP3 to decrease the heat production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Animal Science College of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Shuhong", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiaoheng", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Su", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Riyue", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Hongning", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Ningying", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "3", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20222425"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
