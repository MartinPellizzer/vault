There was a deep relationship between the two countries as Japan had annexed Korea from 1910 to 1945, until the end of World War II.

In 1914, the Chosen Pharmaceutical Association was established; Takasato Kojima was appointed as the first chairman. The first issue of \"The Journal of the Chosen Pharmaceutical Association\" was published in 1921 as the only chemical bulletin in Korea.
