Samples of JG and their raw materials were taken from producers in three districts of Surabaya. The samples were subject to the following examinations: total plate count (TPC), MPN coliform, the enumeration of molds and yeasts, the presence or absence of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Vibrio. Each time the JG samples were taken from different producers together with their raw materials. The results of this investigation showed that most of the JG samples were heavily contaminated with bacteria, yeasts and molds. For bacteria, taken from the TPC results, their numbers were ranging from 7.7 x 10(2) microorganisms/ml to too many to count (TMTC). For yeasts and molds the numbers showed variations from 0 microorganisms/ml to TMTC. Contamination with Coliform in 1 ml of JG were ranged from 0 to > 2.4 x 10(6) microorganisms. In most of the samples pathogenic Staphylococci, Salmonella sp. and Vibrio sp. were not detected, so that a conclusion can be drawn that most of the contamination in JG are saprophytic, only a few pathogenic. The results also show that it is possible to have JG which fulfill the government's requirements. Similar results were obtained with the plant material constituents of JG such as rhizomes, leaves, herbs and fruits of Piper nigrum and Piper retrofractum, with the exception of Piper betle leaves and P. retrofractum fruits, both showing low contamination of Coliform bacteria. However, the fruits of Citrus aurantifolia and Morinda citrifolia were less contaminated, just like seeds of Oryza sativa, Parkia roxburghii, bulbs of Allium sativum and the pulp of Tamarindus indica. With these plant constituents of JG, it might be of interest to screen their antibacterial and antifungal activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Widya Mandala Catholic University, Surabaya, Indonesia."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Limyati", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Juniar", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enterobacteriaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Salmonella"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Vibrio"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "2", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10030724", "10.1016/s0378-8741(98)00082-8", "S0378874198000828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
