In this study, methanol and dichloromethane extracts of S. fruticosa were explored for phytochemical, biological and toxicological parameters. Total phenolic and flavonoid constituents were determined by using standard aluminum chloride and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, and UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extract was performed for tentative identification of secondary metabolites. Different standard methods like DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and metal chelation assays were utilized to find out the antioxidant potential of extracts. Enzyme inhibition studies of extracts against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase and, \u03b1-glucosidase enzymes were also studied. Likewise, the cytotoxicity was also assessed against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and DU-145\u00a0cell lines. The higher phenolic and flavonoids contents were observed in methanol extracts which can be correlated to its higher radical scavenging potential. Similarly, 11 different secondary metabolites were tentatively identified by UHPLC profiling. Both the extract showed significant inhibition against all the enzymes except for \u03b1-glucosidase. Moreover, docking studies were also performed against the tested enzymes. In the case of cytotoxicity, both the samples were found moderately toxic against the tested cell lines. This plant can be explored further for its potential therapeutic and edible uses."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
