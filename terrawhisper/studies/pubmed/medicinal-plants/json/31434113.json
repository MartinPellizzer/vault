However, only limited studies have been conducted to date on ginseng miRNAs. In the present study, we collected 3 ginseng samples from the Changbai Mountain in China. Small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Sequencing analyses identified 3798 miRNAs, including 298 known miRNAs and 3500 potentially novel miRNAs. The miR166, miR159, and miR396 families were among the most highly expressed miRNAs in all libraries. The results of miRNA expression analyses were validated by qRT-PCR. Target gene prediction through computational and pathway annotation analyses revealed that the primary pathways were related to plant development, including metabolic processes and single-organism processes. It has been reported that plant miRNAs might be one of the hidden bioactive ingredients in medicinal plants. Based on the combined use of RNAhybrid, Miranda, and TargetScan software, a total of 50,992 potential human genes were predicted as the putative targets of 2868 miRNAs. Interestingly, the enriched KEGG pathways were associated with some human diseases, especially cancer, immune system diseases, and neurological disorders, and this could support the clinical use of ginseng. However, the human targets of ginseng miRNAs should be confirmed by further experimental validation. Our results provided valuable insight into ginseng miRNAs and the putative roles of these miRNAs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangdong Engineering &Technology Research Center of Topical Precise Drug Delivery System, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yingfang", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Mengyuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yanlin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Wenjuan", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Zhihua", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Basic Courses, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Zemin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Zhiyun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Gong", "ForeName": "Mengjuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Yin", "ForeName": "Yongqin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Library"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Software"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31434113", "10.1055/a-0989-7302"]}}]}
