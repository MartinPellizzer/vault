This study evaluated the leaf, corm, peel and root of H. hemerocallidea for their nutritional attributes. Crude protein was highest in leaf (5.56%), followed by peel (2.79%), root (2.30%) and corm (1.79%) respectively. Crude fat ranged from 0.40% in root to 1.88% in leaf, while ash and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were highest in corm (16.77% and 49.75%) and lowest in root (3.20% and 5.46%) respectively. Neutral detergent fibre (NDF) was highest in leaf (55.47%), followed by corm (52.38%), peel (35.23%) and root (10.51%); while total carbohydrate calculated as non-fibre carbohydrate was highest in the root. The corm had the highest content (P<0.05) of calcium, zinc, copper and manganese, the root exhibited the highest content of magnesium, potassium and iron, while sodium and phosphorus content was highest in the leaf. The study revealed that H. hemerocallidea leaf, corm, peel and root are good sources of nutrients and minerals for humans and animals. This implies that the plant as a whole could be more effective therapeuticaly than the corm alone."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Otunola", "ForeName": "Gloria Aderonke", "Initials": "GA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Department of Botany, University of Fort Hare, Alice 5700, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Afolayan", "ForeName": "Anthony Jide", "Initials": "AJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoxis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081763"]}}]}
