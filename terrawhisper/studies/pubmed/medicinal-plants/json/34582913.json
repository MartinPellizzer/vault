Although some genes encoding UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) have been functionally characterized in G. uralensis, other UGTs mechanisms of glycosylation remain to be elucidated. Against this background the aim of the present study included cloning and characterization of two full-length cDNA clones of GuUGT isoforms from the UGT multigene family. These included GuUGT2 (NCBI acc. MK341791) and GuUGT3 (NCBI acc. MK341793) with an ORF of 1473 and 1332\u00a0bp, respectively. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis revealed GuUGTs protein of Glycine max had a high homology to that of other plants. Meanwhile, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the transcript levels of GuUGTs in different tissues. The results indicated that GuUGTs was more expressed in roots as compared to the leaves, and significantly up-regulated upon NaCl stress. The recombinant protein was heterologous expressed in Escherichia coli and exhibited a high level of UGT activity, catalyzing formation of isoliquiritin and liquiritin from isoliquiritigenin and liquiritigenin. The key residues of GuUGT2 for liquiritigenin glycosylation (Asn223), isoliquiritigenin (Asp272) were predicted by molecular docking and residue scanning based on simulated mutations. These results could serve as an important reference to understand the function of the UGT family. In addition, the identification of GuUGT2 and GuUGT3 provides a foundation for future studies of flavonoid biosynthesis in G. uralensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
