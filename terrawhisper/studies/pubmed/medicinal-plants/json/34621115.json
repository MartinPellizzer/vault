The history of plants is closely related with the history of medicine since time immemorial. Various literature data shows the usage of medicinal plants. It is linked to various system of medicine like Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani. This is in practice for more than 5000 years. People in olden age had a detailed knowledge on these plants. Hence, we collected such data from the first five volumes of Epigraphia Indica, which was published, by the Archeological survey of India from 1882 to 1977. These data provides a framework on various plants and its usage in various ways, in different time period in human history. This helps us to drive valuable bio-medical information for application in modern scientific biomedical methods. We further plan to sort and glean such data so as to help in evaluating the total biomedical data in Epigraphia Indica to extract useful biological knowledge for application in evidence-based biomedicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Biomedical Informatics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage, Hyderabad - 500036, India."}], "LastName": "Sridevi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Indian Medicine, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Sriram", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage, Hyderabad - 500036, India."}], "LastName": "Saket Ram", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage, Hyderabad - 500036, India."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Pvv", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Council for Research In Siddha, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Kanakavalli", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Bioinformation", "NlmUniqueID": "101258255", "ISSNLinking": "0973-2063"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "  https://archive.org/details/EpigraphiaIndicaVol1."}, {"Citation": "  https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.49129/page/n9/mode/2up."}, {"Citation": "  https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.108298."}, {"Citation": "  https://archive.org/details/EpigraphiaIndicaVol4."}, {"Citation": "  https://archive.org/details/epigraphiaIndica014342mbp."}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34621115", "PMC8457014", "10.6026/97320630016695", "97320630016695"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
