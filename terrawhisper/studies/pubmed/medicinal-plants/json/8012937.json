Although oral administration of a methanolic extract of this plant root (50, 100 or 150 mg/kg for 4, 8 or 12 weeks) has been found to have very little or no effect on hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5 contents as well as NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity, it afforded a marked induction of uridine diphosphoglucuronyl transferase activities of liver microsomes. The extract also significantly increased the activities of microsomal uridine diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate): quinine reductase and cytosolic glutathione s-transferases with a concomittant elevation in the contents of reduced glutathione. All these effects were found to be dose-dependent and maintained during 12 weeks of the extract treatment. Results of the study clearly indicate that the intracellular contents of active intermediates of various xenobiotics including chemical carcinogens would be reduced by the specific enhancement of drug-detoxifying enzymes in the liver of rats treated with the plant extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Calcutta, India."}], "LastName": "Bishayee", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chatterjee", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.22", "NameOfSubstance": "Uridine Diphosphate Glucose Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Uridine Diphosphate Glucose Dehydrogenase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8012937", "10.1016/0304-3835(94)90202-x", "0304-3835(94)90202-X"]}}]}
