Natural boswellic acids (BAs) and their source, frankincense, have been reported to possess <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> anticancer effects toward various cancer cells.<b>Areas covered</b>: This comprehensive review focuses on the importance of boswellic acids (BAs) for the establishment of future treatments of cancer. Moreover, potent semisynthetic derivatives of BAs have been described along with their mode of action. In addition, important structural features of the semisynthetic BAs required for cytotoxic effects are also discussed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Numerous semisynthetic BAs illustrate excellent cytotoxic effects. Of note, compounds bearing cyanoenone moieties in ring A, endoperoxides and hybrids display increased and more potent cytotoxic effects compared with other semisynthetic BAs. Moreover, BAs have the potential to conjugate or couple with other anticancer compounds to synergistically increase their combined anticancer effects. In addition, to get derived BAs to become lead anticancer compounds, future research should focus on the preparation of ring A cyanoenones, endoperoxides, and C-24 amide analogs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Weinberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "Hidayat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Key Laboratory for Applied Technology of Sophisticated Analytical Instruments of Shandong Province, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Jinan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Karakoram International University, Gilgit, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Iftikhar", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Key Laboratory for Applied Technology of Sophisticated Analytical Instruments of Shandong Province, Shandong Analysis and Test Center, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Jinan, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Daijie", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota (Twin Cities), Minneapolis, USA."}], "LastName": "Hakkim", "ForeName": "Faruck L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioorganic Chemistry, Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry, Weinberg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Westermann", "ForeName": "Bernhard", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Division, Research Center, Dhofar University, Salalah, Oman."}], "LastName": "Rashan", "ForeName": "Luay", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Ishtiaq", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry and Polymer Science, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Green", "ForeName": "Ivan R", "Initials": "IR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Drug Discov", "NlmUniqueID": "101295755", "ISSNLinking": "1746-0441"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Boswellia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "2", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33650441", "10.1080/17460441.2021.1892640"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
