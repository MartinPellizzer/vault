Various studies have demonstrated the influence of gamma rays on the morphology, physiology, and biochemistry of plants. Recent research efforts have also shown that low-dose gamma (5-100\u2009Gy) irradiation can be utilized as an expedient solution to alleviate the deleterious effect of abiotic stresses and to obtain better yields of plants. Inducing mutagenesis using gamma irradiation has also evolved as a better option for inducing genetic variability in crops, vegetables, medicinal and ornamentals for their genetic improvement. Plant SMs are gaining increasing importance as pharmaceutical, therapeutic, cosmetic, and agricultural products. Plant cell, tissue, and organ cultures represent an attractive alternative to conventional methods of procuring useful SMs. Among the varied approaches the elicitor-induced in vitro culture techniques are considered an efficient tool for studying and improving the production of SMs. This review focuses on the utilization of low-dose gamma irradiation in the production of high-value SMs such as phenolics, terpenoids, and alkaloids. Furthermore, we present varied successful examples of gamma-ray-induced mutations in the production of SMs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5503-0202"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Karnatak University, Dharwad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Murthy", "ForeName": "Hosakatte Niranjana", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4384-2462"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, India."}], "LastName": "Joseph", "ForeName": "Kadanthottu Sebastian", "Initials": "KS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2897-091X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Paek", "ForeName": "Kee Yoeup", "Initials": "KY"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8662-0590"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "So Young", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Radiat Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8809243", "ISSNLinking": "0955-3002"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gamma Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "49"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38451191", "10.1080/09553002.2024.2324469"]}}]}
