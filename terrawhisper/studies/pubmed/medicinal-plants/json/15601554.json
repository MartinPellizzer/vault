Radiotherapy is a major therapy for NPC in early phase,while proper chemotherapy is necessary for NPC in late phase. Some chemotherapeutic drugs have been used to treat tumors by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells. This study was to investigate effects of curcumin on proliferation,and apoptosis of NPC cell line CNE-2Z.", "CNE-2Z cells were treated with different concentrations of curcumin, inhibition rates of cell proliferation,and IC(50) of curcumin were detected by MTT method. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM), agarose gel electrophoresis,and Hoechst33258-PI fluorescence staining.", "Proliferation of CNE-2Z cells was inhibited obviously by curcumin in dose- and time-dependent manners. IC(50) of curcumin to CNE-2Z cells at 24,48,and 72 h were (24.05+/-0.47),(19.20+/-0.17),and (7.35+/-0.50) micromol/L, respectively. After treated with 5,10,and 20 micromol/L of curcumin for 24 h, apoptotic rates of CNE-2Z cells were (4.9+/-3.2)%,(10.7+/-2.7)%, and (14.7+/-0.5)%, respectively. After treated with 10,20 micromol/L of curcumin for 24 h, morphologic changes, such as chromatin shrinkage,nuclear condensation,and chromatin fragmentation,were observed in CNE-2Z cells by fluorescent staining, a fragmented DNA ladder was detected by electrophoresis.", "Curcumin may induce apoptosis, and inhibit proliferation of CNE-2Z cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Guangdong Medical College, Zhanjiang, Guangdong 524023, P.R.
