After the diagnosis of APN based on the clinical signs and symptoms, urine analysis, urine culture, and dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan (DMSA scan), the patients were randomly allocated into either the control group (n=30 patients: received standard antibiotic treatment only) or the intervention group (n=30 patients: received standard antibiotic-treatment in combination with oral omega-3 fatty acids based on the children's weight for three consecutive days). A second DMSA scan was performed for the patients at a minimum of six months after treatment. The development of renal scars was evaluated by comparing the baseline DMSA scan lesions with the follow-up DMSA scan lesions.", "Fifty patients, including 26 and 24 individuals in the control and intervention groups, respectively, completed the entire course of the study. Renal parenchymal involvement based on the baseline DMSA scan was similar in the two groups (p-value =0.85, 0.90, and 0.53 regarding the right, left, and both kidney units together, respectively). Although comparison of the follow-up DMSA scan lesions to the baseline DMSA scan lesions considering the right and left kidneys as separate units between two groups did not reach the significant level, when considering both left and right kidney units together, results showed a statistically significant difference between groups in favor of the intervention group (p-value =0.04).", "Although preliminary, the results of this study showed that administration of omega-3 fatty acids, a natural supplement with well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, as an adjunct therapy to standard antibiotic treatment might significantly reduce the incidence of the occurrence renal scarring following APN in children. Confirmation of these results requires further studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatrics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sedighi", "ForeName": "Iraj", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taheri-Moghadam", "ForeName": "Ghazal", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Besat Hospital, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Emad-Momtaz", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Physiology Research Center, Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vaseghi", "ForeName": "Golnaz", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Eshraghi", "ForeName": "Azadeh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Community and Preventive Medicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asnaashari", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mehrpooya", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "9407284059", "Agency": "Vice-Chancellor of Research and Technology of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pediatr Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101240290", "ISSNLinking": "1573-3963"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Omega-3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "494JNQ8L28", "NameOfSubstance": "Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cicatrix"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Omega-3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pyelonephritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Technetium Tc 99m Dimercaptosuccinic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Tract Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "1", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34503428", "10.2174/1573396317666210909153643", "CPR-EPUB-117805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
