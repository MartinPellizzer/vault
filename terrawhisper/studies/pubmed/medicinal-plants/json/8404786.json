Fasting and post-meal blood samples were obtained for 7 h and chylomicrons (CM) were isolated. Lipoproteins (VLDL+CM remnants, LDL, HDL) were isolated from the baseline samples and the samples of the 2-3 h triglyceride peaks. As compared to the postprandial response given by the control low-fibre test meal, adding fibre induced no change in serum glucose, insulin or Apo A1 and Apo B variations. The serum triglyceride response was not altered by adding fibres but the 2-3 h chylomicron triglyceride rise was increased (P < or = 0.05) by soybean fibre. VLDL+CM remnants, LDL and HDL triglyceride variations were unchanged with fibres. Cholesterolaemia decreased postprandially for 6 h, and was further lowered in the presence of pea fibre. This resulted from a marked decrease in serum esterified cholesterol. The chylomicron cholesterol and phospholipid rise was lowered in the presence of either fibre. The postprandial changes in the free cholesterol concentrations of the various lipoprotein classes were not altered by fibre whereas changes from baseline in esterified cholesterol concentrations were reduced by soybean fibre in LDL and amplified by soybean and pea fibres in HDL. The results obtained show that dietary fibre present in legumes may alter postprandial lipaemia and lipoproteins in humans to a variable extent. These effects could be related to some long-term metabolic effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit\u00e9 130-INSERM (National Institute of Health and Medical Research, Marseille, France."}], "LastName": "Dubois", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cara", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Armand", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Borel", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Senft", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Portugal", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pauli", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bernard", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lafont", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lairon", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Eur J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8804070", "ISSNLinking": "0954-3007"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chylomicrons"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Chylomicrons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8404786"]}}]}
