This digestive tract disease not only affects the absorption of food components by destroying the intestinal epithelial structure, but also can induce diseases in remote organs <i>via</i> the gut-organ axis, seriously harming human health. Nowadays, increasing attention is being paid to the nutritional and medicinal value of food components with increasing awareness among the general public regarding health. As an important member of the isothiocyanates, sulforaphane (SFN) is abundant in cruciferous plants and is famous for its excellent anti-cancer effects. With the development of clinical research, more physiological activities of SFN, such as antidepressant, hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory activities, have been discovered, supporting the fact that SFN and SFN-rich sources have great potential to be dietary supplements that are beneficial to health. This review summarizes the characteristics of intestinal inflammation, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of SFN and its various protective effects on intestinal inflammation, and the possible future applications of SFN for promoting intestinal health have also been discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6531-7269"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, 100176, People's Republic of China. chenyingcaiq@163.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009, China. lzheng@hfut.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Li-Yang", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, 100176, People's Republic of China. chenyingcaiq@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jiu-Kai", "Initials": "JK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Food and Biological Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei 230009, China. lzheng@hfut.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, 100176, People's Republic of China. chenyingcaiq@163.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GA49J4310U", "NameOfSubstance": "sulforaphane"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Microbiome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "microbiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isothiocyanates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfoxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34935814", "10.1039/d1fo03398k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
