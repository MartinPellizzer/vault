A complete neuro-otologic and equilibrimetric examination was performed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, with evaluation of clinical findings. In the first month of therapy, vertigo and dizziness improved in 64.7% of patients treated with BI and in 65% of those who received EGb 761. Compared to baseline, no statistically significant changes were observed in cranial scans for patients with a \"central\" cranial pattern. Likewise, no changes versus baseline were observed in both groups for the equilibrium score. The comprehensive test battery showed the following findings: EGb 761 induced a slight decrease of saccadic delay and considerably increased saccadic velocities; BI improved saccadic accuracy but did not modify delay; EGb 761 improved smooth pursuit gain at 0.4 Hz 40 degrees/s three times more than BI; both drugs asymmetrically reduced nystagmus maximum velocity at 40 degrees/s; both drugs asymmetrically improved the sinusoidal vestibulo-ocular reflex; BI considerably reduced--whereas EGb 761 considerably improved--visuovestibular ocular reflex. No side effects were recorded during the trial except for transient mild headache and gastric upset in 2 patients receiving EGb 761 and transient cyanosis of nails and lips in 1 patient given BI. These results suggest that EGb 761 and BI operate at different equilibrium receptor sites and show that EGb 761 can considerably improve oculomotor and visuovestibular function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Otolaryngology, University of Sassari, Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cesarani", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meloni", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alpini", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barozzi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verderio", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Boscani", "ForeName": "P F", "Initials": "PF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Controlled Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "8611864", "ISSNLinking": "0741-238X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X32KK4201D", "NameOfSubstance": "Betahistine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Betahistine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Postural Balance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prognosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sensation Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10345150", "149"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
