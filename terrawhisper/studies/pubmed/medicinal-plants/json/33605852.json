Various studies on medicinal plants showed the protective effect of herbals in animal models of epilepsy.", "In the present review, a status analysis of the traditional use of various medicinal plants in epilepsy with a special focus on plats having anti-inflammatory potential is recorded.", "The shortcomings of research on medicinal plants which need to be explored further in order to tackle the growing need for safer and effective drugs for epilepsy are discussed. Overall, there is a huge scope of herbal drugs in CNS disorders, especially epilepsy, either as an adjunct by reducing the dose and thus side effects of standard anti-epileptic drugs or as a standalone agent. Although, there is still an urgent need of well planned randomized controlled clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientist C, Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi - 110029, India."}], "LastName": "Pahuja", "ForeName": "Monika", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Neurological Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis-63110, Missouri, USA."}], "LastName": "Mehla", "ForeName": "Jogender", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi - 110029, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Yogendra Kumar", "Initials": "YK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Comb Chem High Throughput Screen", "NlmUniqueID": "9810948", "ISSNLinking": "1386-2073"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Epilepsy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33605852", "10.2174/1386207324666210219103430", "CCHTS-EPUB-114378"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
