Since ancient times, such plants have been used in ethnopharmacology. A number of medicines have been developed from plant origin by researchers and researchers continue to be interested in plant-based medicines. Zingiberaceae is a well-known plant family for such types of medicinal and aromatic plants. Zingiber is the third largest genus of this family and Zingiber roseum (Roxb.) Roscoe is a medicinal and aromatic Z. roseum is a rhizomatous perennial herbaceous plant of this genus, popularly known as \"Rosy Ginger\" and \"Jangli Adrak,\" utilized in the Siddha arrangement of medication, and its rhizomes have been used to treat injury, cough, asthma, skin illnesses, gastric ulcers, liver diseases, and heartburn in tradition. It also has ethnopharmacological uses, such as the rhizome of Z. roseum is used for digestion, relieving giddiness, and as a stimulant. Apart from this, it has been reported for several pharmacological activities such as antispasmodic, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial, and anticancer activities, etc. Z. roseum is a reservoir of several chemical constituents such as terpenes and terpenoids such as linalool, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, limonene, terpinen-4-ol, \u03b1- terpineol, etc., phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, and ascorbic acid along with important unique constituents such as zerumbone which are responsible for its medicinal and other biological activities. In this review article, we discussed the thorough knowledge published by researchers regarding the phytochemistry, ethnopharmacological, and mediational properties of Z. roseum and its botanical descriptions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, G.B.
