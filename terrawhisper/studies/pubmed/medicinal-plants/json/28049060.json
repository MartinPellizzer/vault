Polyphenols are the main active substances that contribute to the antioxidant activity of Lonicera japonica. For studying on the effect of chromosome doubling and harvest time on the dynamic accumulation of the main active substances and antioxidant capabilities of L.\u00a0japonica, the polyphenol composition contents (7 phenolic acids and 3 flavonoids) and the antioxidant capacity in buds and flowers of diploid and tetraploid L.\u00a0japonica at six different growth stages were determined by HPLC-DAD and three common antioxidant assays (FRAP, OH RSC and DPPH ARP), and the correlation between the dynamic accumulation of the polyphenol components and antioxidant capacity was also analyzed in current research. The results indicated that the content of the most determined phenolic acids and flavonoids and the antioxidant capacity in most of the growth stages from tetraploid plants were significantly higher than those in the diploid plants. Furthermore, the changes in the antioxidant activity presented a significant positive correlation with the variations in the chlorogenic acid, rutin, hyperoside, luteoloside in the two ploidy levels of L.\u00a0japonica plants. The higher yields of chlorogenic acid (158.97, 164.00, 199.85\u00a0mg), luteoloside (5.44, 4.03, 6.31\u00a0mg), hyperoside (1.15, 1.06, 1.30\u00a0mg) and total flavonoids (9.87, 8.67, 11.10\u00a0mg) from 100 buds or flowers in tetraploid plants occurred during the S3-S5 stages, and these stages also exhibited higher antioxidant activities. Therefore, the stages of S3-S5 are recommended as the best time for harvesting high-yield, high-quality tetraploid Flos Lonicerae Japonicae."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
