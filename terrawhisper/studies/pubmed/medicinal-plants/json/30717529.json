Trehalose plays an important role in the resurrection process, and the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase(TPS) is the key enzyme to synthesize trehalose in plants. In this study, the sequence of TPS was obtained by splicing from the transcriptome data of S. tamariscina. After the synthesis of cDNA based on the template of total RNA, the sequence was cloned by RT-PCR for verification and then analyzed by bioinformatics methods. The results indicated that the full-length coding sequence of StTPS was 2 799 bp (GenBank accession no. MH155231), and the encoded protein contained 932 amino acids. StTPS could be located in the chloroplastid according to subcellular localization prediction. There were two conserved domains belonging to glycogen phosphorylase glycosyltransferase (GPGTF) family but no signal peptide or transmembrane domain in StTPS. The expression of StTPS was determined by qRT-PCR and the variation of trehalose content was measured by HPLC-ELSD during the resurrection process of S. tamariscina. Meanwhile, the correlation between them was analyzed. The results showed that both the expression level of StTPS and the trehalose content increased associated with the extension of dehydration time, and declined associated with the extension of rehydration time which proved a significant positive correlation between the StTPS expression level and the trehalose content. The results suggested that the StTPS probably plays a central role in recovery process in S. tamariscina."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Cai-Cai", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hong-Mei", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Hao", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B8WCK70T7I", "NameOfSubstance": "Trehalose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "trehalose-6-phosphate synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Selaginellaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trehalose"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30717529", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2018.0128"]}}]}
