Total dietary fiber (TDF) was measured by the Mongeau (AOAC 992.16), Prosky (AOAC 985.29), and Lee (AOAC 991.43) methods (A, B, and C, respectively). Nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) were measured by the Englyst gas-chromatographic method that included dimethyl sulfoxide treatment, and the lignin measured separately was added to NSP (method D). TDF was also measured by the Li method (E). TDF values ranged from 7 to 48 g/100 g dry weight. Methods B and C gave similar TDF values, which were higher than those from other methods. For kidney beans I, TDF values by methods B and C were up to 2.5 times higher because of the inclusion of starch. The fiber residues from methods A and C contained the same amounts of arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and uronic acid, but glucose was 4 times higher in residue C than in residue A. When alpha-amylase from porcine pancreas was incorporated in methods B or C for 5 samples, the discrepancies among methods A, B, and C were reduced by 60-98%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Banting Research Centre, Nutrition Research Division, Ottawa, ON, Canada."}], "LastName": "Mongeau", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brassard", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J AOAC Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9215446", "ISSNLinking": "1060-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Uronic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A1TA934AKO", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B40ROO395Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabinose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "PHA4727WTP", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X2RN3Q8DNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YOW8V9698H", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arabinose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimethyl Sulfoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Galactose"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Mannose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Uronic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Xylose"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7950419"]}}]}
