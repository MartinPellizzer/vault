Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim1 (PIM1) is involved in cell survival and proliferation, with great relevance for oncogenesis. PIM1 plays a major role in the progression of various common complex human cancers, including prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematopoietic malignancies. The overexpression of PIM1 leads to cancer progression, and thus it is considered as a potential target for drug design and development purposes. Here, we report original <i>in silico</i> findings by employing structure-based virtual screening to discover potential phytoconstituents from the medicinal plants-based compounds, which could inhibit the PIM1 activity, using the IMPPAT (a curated database of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics) database. The initial hits were selected based on their binding affinity toward PIM1 calculated through the molecular docking approach. Subsequently, interaction analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns was carried out to study the conformational dynamics and complex stability of PIM1 with the identified compounds. Importantly, we found that PIM1 forms stable protein-ligand complexes with the phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin in particular. Our findings suggest that identified phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin bind to PIM1 in ATP-competitive binding mode. These findings and the compounds reported herein warrant further exploration as promising scaffolds for anticancer drug design, discovery, and development."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Anjum", "ForeName": "Farah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0399-4835"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Mohammad", "ForeName": "Taj", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Almalki", "ForeName": "Abdulraheem Ali", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine, Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia."}], "LastName": "Akhtar", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Scientific Department, Akfa University, Tashkent, Uzbekistan."}], "LastName": "Abdullaev", "ForeName": "Bekhzod", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3663-4940"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Md Imtaiyaz", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "OMICS", "NlmUniqueID": "101131135", "ISSNLinking": "1536-2310"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "PIM1 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "27", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34448628", "10.1089/omi.2021.0107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
