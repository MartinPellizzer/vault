The first group was treated by dihydroartemisinin produced and formulated in the People's Republic of China, the second group was treated by dihydroartemisinin produced in Vietnam but formulated by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand and the third group was treated by dihydroartemisinin produced and formulated by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization of Thailand. All patients were admitted to hospital to evaluate safety and efficacy for a total of 28 days. By the third day of treatment, most patients were blood-smear negative for parasites and none had serious adverse effects. Minor symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and headache were similar in the three groups and disappeared after 3 days of treatment. One-hundred and thirty-three patients completed the 28-day follow-up period. The cure rates of groups I, II and III were 80%, 85% and 92%, respectively (P > 0.02). There were no significant differences in fever clearance or parasite clearance among the three groups. We conclude that the three formulations of dihydroartemisinin produced and formulated in different countries were safe and effective in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria acquired in Thailand."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine, Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Thailand."}], "LastName": "Wilairatana", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chanthavanich", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Singhasivanon", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Treeprasertsuk", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krudsood", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chalermrut", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Phisalaphong", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kraisintu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Looareesuwan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Parasitol", "NlmUniqueID": "0314024", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7519"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6A9O50735X", "NameOfSubstance": "artenimol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria, Falciparum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9762567", "10.1016/s0020-7519(98)00101-5", "S0020-7519(98)00101-5"]}}]}
