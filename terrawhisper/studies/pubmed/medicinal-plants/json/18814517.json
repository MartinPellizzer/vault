Many of the members of this community still use traditional methods of healing, such as blood-letting, burns, tattooing, amulets, healing water, incense and various medicinal herbs that are prescribed based on the diagnosis of the disease. This study deals with documenting the use of the medicinal drugs implemented by the Ethiopian community in Israel, which is a rapidly vanishing world. The study is based on interviews with hundreds of informants, among them traditional healers, and it surveyed some fifty shops which sell Ethiopian medicinal drugs and spices. The survey brought to light a list of medical materials which are found in the Ethiopian markets in Israel including 89 kinds of plants (some 85%); 6 different minerals (some 6%); 5 types of animals (some 4.5%); and 5 substances of various origins (some 4.5%). Most of the drugs are imported from Ethiopia to Israel, since they are endemic. There are also other medicinal drugs that are gathered in the field in Israel or brought through personal import; in total, our estimate is that there are approximately 150 different kinds of medicinal drugs in use in Israel. This is a relatively small number when compared to the inventory of drugs in the land of origin, Ethiopia. The decline in the use of traditional drugs, due to limited availability and processes of modernization in the Ethiopian community in Israel, heightens the importance of a study that documents this unique culture. The study is also of assistance to the modern medical authorities in order to better understand and become more familiar with the Ethiopian community and with its needs and special practices, in terms of both prevention and treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Unit of the History of Medicine, Department of Land of Israel Studies and Archaeology, Bar-Ilan University."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Danino", "ForeName": "Dikla", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Amar", "ForeName": "Zohar", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Israel", "MedlineTA": "Harefuah", "NlmUniqueID": "0034351", "ISSNLinking": "0017-7768"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acculturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Documentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emigration and Immigration"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Israel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18814517"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
