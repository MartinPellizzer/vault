During the treatment, the rats' body weights, arthritis indices and paw volumes were measured every 5 days. Subsequently, rats' blood samples were collected to determine TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and C-reactive protein (CRP) contents in serum. Then, rats were sacrificed and the hind paws and knee joints were collected for histopathological examination.", "Our results indicated that ERCP significantly suppressed the inflammatory reactions and destructions in joints and synovial tissues.
