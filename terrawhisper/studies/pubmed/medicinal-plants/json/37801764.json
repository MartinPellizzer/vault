In addition, oxidative stability, hardness, color and sensory properties of fortified muffins were investigated. The fortification of muffin formulations with 6 % hydrolysates increased antioxidant activity six times higher than that of the control sample. As the hydrolysate increased to 6 %, the \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition also increased to 88 and 40 %, respectively. The 6 % fortified muffins exhibited lower peroxide and thiobarbituric acid values during a 14 day storage than the control muffins, while higher hydrolysate levels darkened the color and softened the texture. Sensory evaluation indicated that muffins with 2% hydrolysates achieved similar overall acceptance as the control. It can be concluded that brewer's spent grain hydrolysate is suitable for functional bakery products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..
