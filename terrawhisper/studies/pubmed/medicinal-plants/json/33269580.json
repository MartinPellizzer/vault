Plant species, St. John's wort, chamomile, calendula, yarrow, shepherd's purse and tea tree oil are all well known for their anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and wound healing activity. This paper presents the results of a clinical study in which three herbal formulations/vagitories, based on extracts of St. John's wort, chamomile, calendula, yarrow, shepherd's purse and tea tree oil, were investigated for their effectiveness on vaginitis. Methods This was a randomized controlled clinical study that included 210 women with diagnosed vaginitis. Patients were divided into two basic groups, women in reproductive period and postmenopausal period. Three subgroups including 30 patients each received one of the three vagitorie formulations for 5 days, after which the effects on subjective and objective symptoms were monitored. Results Three types of vagitories based on plant extracts had a positive effect in the treatment of vaginitis. Vagitories based on tea tree oil showed better efficiency compared to vagitories with St. John's wort and vagitories based on extracts of five plants. Women in postmenopausal group reported better tolerability of St. John's wort-based and five herbs-based vagitories compared to tea tree oil based vagitories. Conclusion Investigated vagitories showed a positive effect on both objective and subjective symptoms of vagitnis. No serious side effects were reported."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Medical Assotiation of Zenica-Doboj Canton."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Duri\u0107", "ForeName": "Kemal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Tuzla, Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Kov\u010di\u0107 Had\u017eiabdi\u0107", "ForeName": "Selma", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Health Protection of Woman and Maternity of Canton Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Duri\u0107", "ForeName": "Mahira", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Nik\u0161i\u0107", "ForeName": "Haris", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "Uzunovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Alija", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina."}], "LastName": "D\u017eud\u017eevi\u0107 \u010can\u010dar", "ForeName": "Hurija", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "MedlineTA": "Med Glas (Zenica)", "NlmUniqueID": "101250177", "ISSNLinking": "1840-0132"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypericum"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Vaginitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "3", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33269580", "10.17392/1261-21"]}}]}
