The liver is primarily involved in the process of detoxification and this mini-review we focused mainly to investigate the molecular mechanisms heading hepatotoxicity caused due to doxorubicin administration. The alterations in the doxorubicin treated liver tissue include vacuolation of hepatocytes, degeneration of hepatocyte cords, bile duct hyperplasia and focal necrosis. About the literature conducted, hepatotoxicity caused by doxorubicin has been explained by estimating the levels of liver serum biomarkers, ROS production, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The liver serum biomarkers such as ALT and AST, elated levels of free radicals inducing oxidative stress characterized by a surge in Nrf-2, FOXO-1 and HO-1 genes and diminution of anti-oxidant activity characterized by a decline in SOD, GPx, and CAT genes. The augmented levels of SGOT, SGPT, LDH, creatine kinase, direct and total bilirubin levels also reveal the toxicity in the hepatic tissue due to doxorubicin treatment. The molecular insight of hepatotoxicity is mainly due to the production of ROS, ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammation, deteriorated mitochondrial production and functioning, and enhanced apoptosis. Certain substances such as extracts from medicinal plants, natural products, and chemical substances have been shown to produce an alleviating effect against the doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity are also discussed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
