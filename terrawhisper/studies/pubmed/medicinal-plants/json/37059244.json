From tackling gastrointestinal problems to maintaining the healthy functioning of endocrine glands, and from treating malaria to severe dermatological disorders, Teucrium species are known to have extensive therapeutic applications. Teucrium polium L. and Teucrium parviflorum Schreb. are the two members of the genus that have been used in Turkish folk medicine for various medicinal purposes.", "To determine the phytochemical compositions of the essential oils and ethanol extracts of Teucrium polium and Teucrium parviflorum collected from different locations in Turkiye along with the investigation of in vitro antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial activities, and both in vitro and in silico enzyme inhibitory activities of the extracts.", "Ethanol extracts of Teucrium polium aerial parts and roots, and aerial parts of Teucrium parviflorum were prepared. Volatile profiling of the essential oils by GC-MS, phytochemical profiling of the ethanol extracts by LC-HRMS, antioxidant activity by DPPH radical scavenging, ABTS cation radical scavenging, CUPRAC, and metal chelating activity assays, anticholinesterase, antityrosinase, antiurease, activities by different enzyme inhibitory activity assays, anticancer activity by SRB cell viability assay, and antimicrobial activity against a standard panel of bacteria and fungi by the microbroth dilution technique. Molecular docking studies were performed by Autodock Vina (Ver. 1.1.2).", "The studied extracts were found to be quite rich in various biologically important volatile and phenolic compounds. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate, which is a molecule renowned for having great therapeutic potential, was the major compound of all extracts. Teucrium polium aerial parts extract was revealed as a great source for naringenin with 16327\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0685.23\u00a0\u03bcg/g extract. All extracts exerted significant antioxidant activity by different methods. All extracts demonstrated antibutrylcholinesterase, antityrosinase, and antiurease activities by in vitro and in silico assays. Teucrium polium roots extract stood out with remarkable tyrosinase and urease inhibitory and cytotoxic activities.", "The obtained results from this multi-disciplinary study proves that the traditional use of these two Teucrium species is justified, and the mechanisms behind are enlightened."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
