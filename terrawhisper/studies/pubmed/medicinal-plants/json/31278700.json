The aim of this study was to investigate of anti-Candida and antioxidant activities of hydroalcohlic extract from leaves of Rumex obtusifolius. The Rumex obtusifolius Leaves were extracted using Ethyl acetate; methanol and distilled water (6:3:1) by Sox helet system. The hydroalcoholic extraction of Rumex obtusifolius was evaluated for their antioxidant capacities using in vitro methods; including 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, \u03b2-Carotene bleaching test and reducing power assay. Total free phenolics, total flavonoids content and as well as the antifungal activity were also examined. The components of extract were analyzed via GC-Mass instrument. The extract was screened against 40 isolated pathogenic Candida species such as C. albicans and C. glabrata through agar diffusion method. The hydroalcoholic extract can strongly scavenge DPPH radical and its antioxidant capacities which are high correlated with the total free Phenolics and total flavonoids. Also, the extract had high capability inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation and the reducing ability. This study revealed a higher antioxidant capacity in the leaves of Rumex obtusifolius compared with control groups. The minimum inhibitory concentration values within 24 and 48 hours were 200-250\u03bcg/\u03bcL for C. albicans and 250\u03bcg/\u03bcL for C. glabrata. The extract includes high amounts of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity showing is significant. Also, the results confirmed that leaves extract had a potential in anti-Candida activity and suggesting that it could be utilized as a potential source of herbal medicine drugs and natural antioxidants to prevent diseases associated with free radical, anti-fungal disease and food preservation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Mycology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bineshian", "ForeName": "Farahnaz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Seman University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Neda", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Semnan Technical College, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Freidounian", "ForeName": "Mohammadreza", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Seman University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nazari", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rumex"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31278700"]}}]}
