This study aimed to perform a phytochemical analysis of the methanol and dichloromethane extracts obtained from <i>Ziziphora tenuior</i> leaves using GC-MS. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated through the DPPH assay. And, their antibacterial activity was assessed against <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i>, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) bacterial strains. Based on the results 90-92% of these extracts consisted of phytocompounds with pharmaceutical properties. Of these, 5-methyl- 2-(1-methylethylidele), Cyclohexanone (Pulegone; C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O) comprised the highest percentage of the extracts, constituting 62% of methanolic extract and 81% of dichloromethane extract. Also, both methanolic and dichloromethane extracts showed potent antioxidant activity with IC<sub>50</sub> of 277.6\u2009\u00b5g/ml and 49.6\u2009\u00b5g/ml, respectively. Moreover, these extracts demonstrated considerable antibacterial activity against the tested pathogens, especially against <i>S. aureus</i> and VRE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hatami", "ForeName": "Asma", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39086216", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2386127"]}}]}
