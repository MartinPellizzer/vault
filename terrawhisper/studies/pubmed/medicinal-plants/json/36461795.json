Adherence to treatment and discrimination against people are common problems, adversely impacts quality of life. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the use of medicinal plants as therapeutic adjuvants in the treatment of plaque psoriasis through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in patients with plaque psoriasis was carried out, comparing the efficacy of herbal treatments alone or in association with other therapies. The search was performed in the databases of The Cochrane Library, Lilacs, Medline via PubMed and Embase, only including studies published from 2016 to 2020.The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) in patients with plaque psoriasis was carried out, comparing the efficacy of herbal treatments alone or in association with other therapies. We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Lilacs and Cochrane Library databases, only including studies published from 2016 to 2020. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results Out of 2,268 articles evaluated, only seven RCT were eligible for final analysis. Five of these studies evidenced low risk of bias and a high level of evidence. Limitations Few RCT of medicinal plants. Conclusion This meta-analysis indicates that medicinal plants may be used as topical or oral products, either alone or combined with other forms of treatment. These products have the potential to greatly improve the quality of life of the patient."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas), Center for Life Sciences, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Gon\u00e7alves", "ForeName": "Gisele Ms", "Initials": "GM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas), Center for Life Sciences, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Wenceslau", "ForeName": "Laina R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas (PUC-Campinas), Center for Life Sciences, Postgraduate Program in Health Sciences, Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Mendon\u00e7a", "ForeName": "Jose Alexandre", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol", "NlmUniqueID": "7701852", "ISSNLinking": "0378-6323"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["diagnosis", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Psoriasis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Silveira MEB, Neto GP, Ferreira FR,.
