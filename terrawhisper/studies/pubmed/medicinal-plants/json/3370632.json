Participants were randomly distributed into two groups, one receiving 200,000 IU vitamin A per week (0.14 mg/kg body wt/per day) for 6 months, and the other receiving placebo capsules. Their cancer-causing habit, which can be quantitated (an average of 13.1 betel quids/day, 26.1 min/quid), did not change during the trial period. The 6-month oral administration of vitamin A caused complete remission in 57.1% of participants, and a total suppression of the development of new leukoplakias in all chewers receiving vitamin A (n = 21), as compared to 3% and 21%, respectively, in the placebo group (n = 33). The results were substantiated by examining the histological and cytological changes on small biopsies which were taken at the onset and at the completion of the trial period. Over the 6-month period of vitamin A administration, the number of layers of spinous cells decreased in 85% of the participants, the loss of polarity of basal cells was reduced from 72.2% to 22.2% of chewers, subepidermal lymphocytic infiltration was greatly diminished from 66.7% to 5.5% of chewers, and nuclei with condensed chromatin disappeared from the epidermal layer (72.2% before to 0% at the end of the trial)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Carcinogenesis Unit, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada."}], "LastName": "Stich", "ForeName": "H F", "Initials": "HF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hornby", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sankaranarayanan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "7600053", "ISSNLinking": "0304-3835"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukoplakia, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3370632", "10.1016/0304-3835(88)90266-2", "0304-3835(88)90266-2"]}}]}
