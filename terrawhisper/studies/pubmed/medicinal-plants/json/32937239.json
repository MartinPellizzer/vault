The literature reported about trace elements such as Cr and Mn positively affecting diabetes mellitus. The aim of this work is to determine the total, accessible element species, and protein-fraction contents of Cr and Mn in the edible parts of those plants.", "The total contents of Mn were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), while the total contents of Cr was determined by ICP-sector field (sf)-mass spectrometry (MS) due to lower concentration. The protein-fraction contents were determined in accessible element species by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-ICP-MS.", "The separation was successfully carried out to quantify Cr and Mn bound up to 11 protein fractions. The examined plants recorded wide ranges of total contents (Cr 44.7-1880.0\u202f\u03bcg/kg and Mn 3.7-59.0\u202fmg/kg) and accessible element species contents (Cr 0.93-29.40\u202f\u03bcg/kg and Mn 0.82-35.85\u202fmg/kg). Also wide ranges of percentages of accessible element species contents to total contents of Cr (0.65-4.21%) and Mn (5.43-68.42%) were obtained. The hazardous indices of both trace elements Cr and Mn for all examined plants consumed by both children and adults were all < 1, indicating no probability of health risk to occur. Moreover, Cr as carcinogen element reported no probability of cancer risk to occur from the consumption of all examined plants. Irrespective of plant species, Cr was quantified in all SEC fractions (mainly protein fractions), with the exception of 1.9-3.7\u202fkDa, while Mn was quantified in all SEC fractions with the exception of 100-120 and 1.3-3.7\u202fkDa. Nevertheless, the majority of accessible Cr species contents bound to the 10-14 and 0.05-0.40\u202fkDa fractions, while that of Mn bound to 0.05-0.40\u202fkDa fraction. To gather, the benefits of specific plant species in terms of accessible Cr and Mn species contents, in addition to accessible Zn species contents reported in our previous study, Haloxylon Salicornicum, Olea Europaea Momordica and Charantia are recommended to be consumed for traditionally controlling T2DM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier GmbH.
