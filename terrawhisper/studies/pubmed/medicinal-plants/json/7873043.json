In vitro tests showed that both concentrates were partially proteolysed and had low antigenic and antitryptic activities. The low antigenicity was confirmed in vivo since none of the calves produced specific plasma antibodies against dietary proteins, and skin reactions following the injection of these proteins were minor. Postprandial plasma level of triglycerides was higher with the 2 legume diets, suggesting faster abomasal emptying of fat and probably protein. Apparent faecal nitrogen digestibility was lower (P < or = 0.05) with the soyabean and lupin diets than with the control diet (0.86, 0.88 and 0.95, respectively). At the ileal level, the differences were smaller and non-significant (0.90, 0.88 and 0.92) for nitrogen, but remained significant for valine and tyrosine with the soyabean diet, and for proline, valine, methionine, leucine and lysine with the lupin diet. However, the differences were small enough to conclude that proper denaturation of soyabean and lupin proteins by processes including partial hydrolysis can suppress their antigenicity and render them very digestible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "INRA, laboratoire du jeune ruminant, Rennes, France."}], "LastName": "Tukur", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pardal", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Formal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Toullec", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lall\u00e8s", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guilloteau", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Reprod Nutr Dev", "NlmUniqueID": "8913069", "ISSNLinking": "0926-5287"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Skin Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7873043", "10.1051/rnd:19950103", "0926528796801791"]}}]}
