The changes of membrane potential which was fluorescent labeled with DiBAC4(3) and its changes were measured by flow cytometer. Phosphorus determination method and spectrophotometry were used to measure the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity of Hep-2 cells membrane after PIV-1 infection. Hep-2 cells membrane phospholipids were fluorescent labeled with NBD-C6-HPC and membrane fluidity was measured by confocal scanning laser microscope. The result demonstrated that post PIV-1 infection membrane potential decreased significantly and the membrane was in a state of hyperpolarization, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity increased significantly and membrane fluidity decreased significantly. There was no apparent interfere effect of TFSB on the changes of membrane potential and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity after PIV-1 infection, while membrane fluidity improved significantly. It was indicated that the cytology mechanism of PIV-1 infection might be related to membrane hyperpolarization, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity increase and membrane fluidity decrease. TFSB can improve membrane fluidity and prevent the infection by protecting the cell membrane. But it is possible that the anti-PIV-1 mechanisms of TFSB had nothing to do with membrane potential and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shan-Shan", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yu-Jing", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Ying-Jie", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Xiao-Lan", "Initials": "XL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 7.2.2.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S2V45N7G3B", "NameOfSubstance": "flavone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Laryngeal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Fluidity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potentials"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Parainfluenza Virus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Respirovirus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2011", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["21351467"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
