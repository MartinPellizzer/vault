SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham operation group, model group, and low, middle and high-dose Xinshao formula groups (0.31, 0.62, 1.25 g\u00b7kg\u207b\u00b9). After administration with Xinshao formula for 7 days, the rats were used to establish the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model. The neurological behavior was evaluated. TTC staining was implemented to determine the volume of cerebral infarction. The levels of ROS, SOD, GSH-PX, NO and iNOS in serum were examined, and the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2, Bax and caspase 3 in hippocampal CA1 were detected by qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical assay and Western blot. It is found that Xinshao formula could significantly reduce the symptoms of nervous function and the volume of cerebral infarction in MACO rats. Compared with model group, the rats in Xinshao formula group showed increases in the activities of SOD and GSH-PX (<i>P</i><0.01), and decreases in the activities of iNOS and the contents of NO, ROS and MDA (<i>P</i><0.01). In addition, Xinshao formula could down-regulate the mRNA and protein levels of Bax and caspase 3 (<i>P</i><0.01), and up-regulated those of Bcl-2 (<i>P</i><0.01) in MACO rats. In conclusion, Xinshao formula showed aprotective effect on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injuryin rats, which may be associated with the promotion of anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ding-Yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Qiong", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zong-Yan", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ai-Min", "Initials": "AM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Brain Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Infarction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30347921", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180427.002"]}}]}
