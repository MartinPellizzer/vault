Twenty-nine compounds representing 97.6% of the total oil were identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes (71.9%) were the principal fraction of the oil with 1,8-cineole (33.8%) and 4aa-7alpha-7aalpha-nepetalactone (23.2%) as the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the oil and its two main constituents were tested against seven bacteria. High activity of the oil and its two main constituents was demonstrated against all the tested bacteria with MIC values in the range of 1.8 - 7.2, 0.9 - 7.2 and 1.8 - 15 mg/mL, respectively."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Res.
