The maximum concentration of thebaine was obtained at the start of flowering. However the dry weight of the roots and the thebaine yield increased until full flowering. Significant differences in the thebaine and dry matter distribution between various parts of the roots were found; the lower part had a higher concentration of the alkaloid than the upper ones. The high thebaine yield (2.5 g/m (2)) obtained during the first growing season is most promising for the exploitation of the roots as raw material for thebaine production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal, Spice and Aromatic Plants, Agricultural Research Organization, The Volcani Center, Bet Dagan 50 250, Israel."}], "LastName": "Levy", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Palevitch", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17265273", "10.1055/s-2006-962438"]}}]}
