Vaccination is the main preventive strategy to reduce rotavirus diarrhea and the severity of episodes, but vaccines are not fully effective and new episodes may occur, even in vaccinated children. The WHO recommends oral rehydration therapy and zinc supplementation for rotavirus-induced diarrhea management. There is little preclinical evidence to support the use of phytotherapeutics in the management of rotaviral infections.", "We aim to review the use of medicinal plants and natural molecules in the management of rotavirus infections in experimental studies.", "Articles, published in the English language between 1991 and 2016, were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science using relevant keywords. The scientific literature mainly focusing on plant natural products with therapeutic efficacies against experimental models of rotavirus, were identified and tabulated. In addition, an assessment of the reliability of animal experiments was determined under ``Risk of Bias'' criteria.", "After an initial search and a revision of the inclusion criteria, 41 reports satisfied the objectives of the study. 36 articles were found concerning the anti-rotaviral potential in rotavirus infected cell lines. Among the active secondary metabolites screened for rotavirus inhibition, the polyphenols of flavonoid structure had acquired the highest number of studies in our survey, compared to phenolic acids, stilbenoids, tannins, pectins, terpenoids and flavonoid glycosides. Also, many phytochemicals reduced the efficacy of viral capsid proteins foremost to their elimination and improved the tendency of host-cell inhibiting virus absorption or by prevention of viral replication. Furthermore, five in vivo studies reported that herbs, as well its components, reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in mice and piglets. The anti-rotavirus efficacy were highlighted based on improvements in reduction on liquid stool, fecal virus shedding, small intestinal histology, levels of inflammation related cytokines and signaling receptors. However, the quality of the experiments in animal studies contained certain types of bias in terms of how they were conducted and reported.", "We identified and summarized studies on medicinal plants and natural molecules having anti-rotavirus activity in order to further future developments of cures for rotavirus gastroenteritis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier GmbH.
