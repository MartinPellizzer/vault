Reproductive dysfunction is one of the major secondary complications in both diabetic animals and human beings. Furthermore, DM has recently broken the age barrier and has been heavily diagnosed in children and young persons of reproductive age. In the past few years, many studies on DM in male reproductive functions in both diabetic men and experimental diabetic animals have been published. It is recognized that sustained hyperglycemia, which impairs reproductive function in diabetic men, is at risk of developing. DM harmfully affects male reproductive functions in multiple areas; these may include spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, fertility capability, penile erection, and ejaculation. Traditional medicine and folklore worldwide have used numerous medicinal plants to manage the diabetic reproductive dysfunction because bioactive phyto-constituents are affluent in many places. Unfortunately, the exact reasons for diabetic male reproductive dysfunction are not completely understood and currently there are no treatments in reproductive medicine specifically for such lesions. The aim of this review is to summarize current research findings of DM on reproductive functions, to elaborate the underlying mechanisms related to these diseases via in vivo and in vitro studies, and to describe the ameliorative effects of medicinal plants or their products. The review findings provide a systematic understanding of DM on the reproductive functions and lay the theoretical foundation for developing the direction of reproductive medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
