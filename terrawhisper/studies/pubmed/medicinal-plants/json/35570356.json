The original plant paintings can be specifically divided into five sections: the whole plant paintings with roots, partial aerial part paintings with roots, plant paintings with ground lines, rootless plant paintings, and broken branch paintings. Among them, the drawings of \" the broken branch paintings \" and \" the whole plant paintings with roots \" are consistent with the basic principles of collecting plant specimens. Additionally, \"the plant and medicinal material paintings \" and \"the medicinal material paintings \"reflect that they were drawn based on the market survey of medicinal materials or collected medicinal materials specimens.
