Notwithstanding the long-recorded use of <i>A.\u00a0carmichaelii</i> in traditional Chinese medicine, no single-entity aconitum alkaloid drug has been developed for clinical use. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used to investigate the marker compounds that can be used to differentiate <i>A.\u00a0carmichaelii</i> from seven other <i>Aconitum</i> species collected in Yunnan Province. Nontargeted principle component analysis scores plots found that all the tested <i>Aconitum</i> species clustered into three distinct groups, and <i>A.\u00a0carmichaelii</i> was significantly different chemically than the other seven species. Furthermore, the primary and lateral roots of <i>A.\u00a0carmichaelii</i> also showed significant differences. Using orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis analysis, eight marker compounds were identified, including 14-acetylkarakoline, aconitine, carmichaeline, fuziline, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, neoline, and talatisamine. Four of these aconitum alkaloids, fuziline, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, and neoline, showed significant analgesic activity in a dose-dependent manner compared to the negative and positive controls. However, hypaconitine, mesaconitine, and neoline exhibited significant acute toxicity activity, while fuziline showed no acute toxicity in mice, suggesting the relative safety of this alkaloid. This study provides a good example of how to differentiate an authentic medicinal plant from common adulterants using a metabolomics approach, and to identify compounds that may be developed into new drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan University, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunan Institue of Materia Medica, Yunnan Baiyao Group Company Limited, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Plant Resources and Sustainable Use, Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Dake", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicine Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Yana", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicine Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Xinyan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicine Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicine Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "Pengzhang", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Chunlin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beijing, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Lehman College, City University of New York, Bronx, New York, USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ph.D. Programs in Biochemistry, Biology, and Chemistry, The Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, USA."}], "LastName": "Kennelly", "ForeName": "Edward J", "Initials": "EJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Aconitum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29076119", "10.1055/s-0043-121708"]}}]}
