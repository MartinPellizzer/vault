However, the therapeutic effect of ICGA-A on colitis is not clear, and thus were investigated in our present study, as well as the underlying mechanisms. Here we found that ICGA-A alleviated clinical symptoms of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) induced colitis model mice, including disease activity index (DAI) and histological damage. In addition, DSS-induced inflammation was significantly attenuated in mice given ICGA-A supplementation. ICGA-A reduced the fraction of neutrophils in peripheral blood and the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages in colon tissue, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and tight junctions in mouse models. Furthermore, ICGA-A down-regulated expression of STAT3 and up-regulated the protein level of I\u03baB\u03b1. Our in vitro studies confirmed that ICGA-A inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ICGA-A blocked the phosphorylation of STAT3, p65, and I\u03baB\u03b1, suppressed the expression STAT3 and p65. In addition, the present study also demonstrated that ICGA-A had no obvious toxicity on normal cells and organs. Taken together, we conclude that ICGA-A mitigates experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) at least in part by inhibiting the STAT3/NF-\u043aB signaling pathways. Hence, ICGA-A may be a promising and effective drug for treating UC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
