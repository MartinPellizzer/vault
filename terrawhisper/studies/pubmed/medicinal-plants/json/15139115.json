Hemodynamic parameters including maximum rate of intraventricular pressure rise (+dp/dtmax), left ventricular systolic pressure(LVSP), maximum velocity of contractile element shortening(Vmax), maximum rate of intraventricular pressure down(-dp/dtmax) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure(LVEDP) were measured by the method of the catheterization. Plasma concentrations of KP, ANP, Ang II and ET were determined by radioimmunoassays. The effects of treatment were evaluated by observing and comparing the changes of heart morphological structure, collagen element, heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW), left intraventricular area(LVA) and myocardial nuclei number (MNN) per square area.", "In high dose SQFXOL group, the LVSP, -dp/dtmax and Vmax were increased, while LVEDP was decreased, and plasma concentrations of KP, Ang II and ET were decreased. In comparision with those in model group, the difference was significant(P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Though the +dp/dtmax and the level of ANP were decreased, the difference was insignificant(all P > 0.05). The collagen tissues around myocardial cells were reduced. HW/BW and LVA were lower, and MNN per square area was higher significantly (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The indices of +dp/dtmax in all of treatment groups and control group were not considerably different in comparison with those in model group. The levels of plasma ANP in middle dose group and low dose group were significantly lower than those in model group(all P < 0.01).", "SQFXOL can reduce the plasma concentrations of KP, Ang II, ET, and ANP, improve the myocardial contractility and relaxation of left ventricular and inhibitate left ventricular remodeling in rats with HF."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Geriatric Cardiology of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Qiao", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shi-wen", "Initials": "SW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Ding-you", "Initials": "DY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zhi-zheng", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endothelins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "atrial natriuretic factor precursor (79-98)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11128-99-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "85637-73-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Atrial Natriuretic Factor"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Astragalus propinquus"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Atrial Natriuretic Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiotonic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelins"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Failure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ophiopogon"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Function, Left"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ventricular Remodeling"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15139115"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
