H9 c2 cells were pretreated with 1. 7%,3. 4% and 6. 8% Shenxiong Glucose Injection,and then H_2O_2 was introduced to induce apoptosis in vitro. Cell viability was detected by MTS assay,morphological changes of apoptosis were observed by AO/EB fluorescence staining,apoptosis rate was detected by Annexin/PI method,cell expression profile was detected by gene chip technology,the mRNA of PIK3 CA,Bcl-2,Bax,caspase-3 and GAPDH were detected by qRT-PCR,the protein expression levels of PIK3 CA,AKT,P-AKT,Bcl-2,Bax and caspase-3 were detected by Western blot,and the contents of LDH and MDA were detected by kit. The results showed that Shenxiong Glucose Injection of different concentrations significantly increased the viability of H9 c2 cells treated with H_2O_2( P<0. 01),and reversed H_2O_2-induced apoptosis( P< 0. 01). The microarray experiments showed that 138 genes were altered in H9 c2 cells after treatment with Shenxiong Glucose Injection. The differential expression fold of PIK3 CA associated with PI3 K/AKT pathway was 3. 59. The results of qRT-PCR and Western blot showed that Shenxiong Glucose Injection could down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of caspase-3( P<0. 01),up-regulate the mRNA and protein expression level of PIK3 CA and Bcl-2( P<0. 01),and up-regulate the phosphorylation levels of AKT( P<0. 01) in H_2O_2-treated H9 c2 cells. The protective effect of Shenxiong Glucose Injection on H_2O_2 cells injury was significantly inhibited by LY294002,a PI3 K/AKT pathway inhibitor. The results suggested that Shenxiong Glucose Injection may inhibit H_2O_2-induced H9 c2 cells apoptosis by regulating PI3 K/AKT signaling pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025,China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ding-Yan", "Initials": "DY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China School of Pharmacy,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Jia", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine and Health Management,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550025,China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Wei-Na", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education) ,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Ministry of Education) ,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yong-Jun", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yong-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Chang-Hu", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics/State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants,Guizhou Medical University Guiyang 550004,China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Morpholines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "shenxiong glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31M2U1DVID", "NameOfSubstance": "2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IY9XDZ35W2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morpholines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31602952", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190619.401"]}}]}
