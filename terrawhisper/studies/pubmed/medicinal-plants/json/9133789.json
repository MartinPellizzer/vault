The two most common sources of knowledge about these medicines were parents/relatives (69.8%) and traditional birth attendants/herbalists (22.6%). 28.5% of non-users indicated they had been advised by doctors not to take the herbs. In most cases, herbal medicine use--generally a daily oral dose--was initiated in the second trimester of pregnancy. Most commonly, such remedies were ingested to improve fetal conditions (45.2%) or make labor easier (16.7%). Conditions such as childhood malnutrition, congenital malformations, tumors, and acute renal failure have been linked to toxic or carcinogenic constituents present in herbal medicines taken during pregnancy. Further research is needed to determine the side effects of Isihlambezo on the pregnant woman, the fetus, the labor process, and the outcome of pregnancy. Moreover, there is a need to identify the active chemical substance in herbal medications, establish their pharmacokinetics, determine whether their use can be clinically identified without reliance on patient self-report, and to develop antidotes. The antagonistic stance of medical practitioners toward herbalism tends to exacerbate the distance between traditional and modern medicine in Africa."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["125965", "00266108"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: TROPICAL DOCTOR."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Africa", "Africa South Of The Sahara", "Culture", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "English Speaking Africa", "Health", "Health Services", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnant Women", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Research Report", "Sampling Studies", "South Africa", "Southern Africa", "Studies", "Surveys"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "9133789", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1997", "Month": "06", "Day": "18"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2022", "Month": "04", "Day": "09"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0049-4755", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "27", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1997", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "Tropical doctor", "ISOAbbreviation": "Trop Doct"}, "ArticleTitle": "The use of traditional herbal medication during pregnancy.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "84", "EndPage": "86", "MedlinePgn": "84-6"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Natal, Congella, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mabina", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moodley", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pitsoe", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Trop Doct", "NlmUniqueID": "1301706", "ISSNLinking": "0049-4755"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenatal Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9133789", "10.1177/004947559702700212"]}}]}
