Interestingly, derivatives that 1-phenyl moiety bearing electron-donating group, especially benzyloxy, and the trans-forms exhibited better protective activity against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity. Compound 11\u00a0m demonstrated the best neuroprotective potency and shown a dose-dependent prevention. The increased intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx caused by NMDA in PC12 cells was reversed in the case of compound 11\u00a0m pretreatment at 15\u00a0\u03bcM. These results suggested that the synthesized 1-phenyl-benzopyrrolizidin-3-one derivatives exerted neuroprotective effect on NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in PC12 cells associated with inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and can be further optimized for the development of neuroprotective agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
