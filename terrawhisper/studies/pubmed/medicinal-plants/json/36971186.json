For the first time, the anti-roundworm bioactivity of ZPs and the active ingredients were compared and investigated. Through nontarget metabolomics following targeted quantitative analysis, qinbunamides, sanshools, sanshooel, asarinin, and sesamin were found to be the main different components of <i>Zanthoxylum</i> species. Coincidentally, the 12 chemical components were also the dominant anti-roundworm ingredients of ZP extracts. The extracts of three species of Chinese prickly ash (1 mg/mL) decreased the hatchability of roundworm eggs significantly, and the ChuanJiao seed killed roundworms (insecticidal rate 100%) and alleviated the symptoms of pneumonia in mice. Furthermore, retention time-accurate mass-tandem mass spectrometry-ion ratio (RT-AM-MS/MS-IR) were modeled by assaying 108 authentic compounds of ZP extracts, and 20 metabolites were confidently identified in biological samples from ZP extract-treated mice by analyzing the <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> values and the empirical substructures. This study provides a good reference for the proper application of ZPs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yunnan Characteristic Plant Extraction Laboratory, Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry for Natural Resource, Ministry of Education and Yunnan Province, School of Chemical Science and Technology, Yunnan University, Kunming 650500, P.
