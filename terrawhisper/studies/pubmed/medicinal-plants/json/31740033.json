This new composite was applied for vortex-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-HDES-ferrofluid-DLLME) of doxycycline (DOC) residual extraction and determined through high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet (HPLC-UV). The characterization of magnetic nanoparticle was investigated by XRD, TEM and FESEM. The dependency of DOC microextraction to main variables and their interaction and find optimum points were undertaken using response surface methodology with either central composite design (CCD). Thus, the optimum pH, ionic strength, ferrofluid volume and vortex time for DOC extraction are determined to be 3.0, 4%w/v, 150\u202f\u03bcL and 7\u202fmin, respectively. According to this condition, linear response is found to be greater than 10-400\u2009ng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>, with a correlation coefficient of 0.983. The detection and quantification limits are 3.6 and 8.5\u202fng\u202fmL<sup>-1</sup>, while the repeatability and reproducibility as precision criteria (RSD%) are 3.74% and 4.15%, respectively. The DOC recoveries in all of the urine, blood plasma and milk samples are between 86.70 and 97.48%, with RSD% lower than 5.72%."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
