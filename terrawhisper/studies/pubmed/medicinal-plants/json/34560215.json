Link is a plant that has been used in medicine in some African countries, Asia and America. It is mainly used in Ayurvedic medicine in India. Several parts of this plant are used for preventing or treating diabetes, haematuria, rheumatism, typhoid, asthma, hepatotoxicity, disorders of haemoglobin and leprosy.", "This review outlines the pharmacological evidence supporting the potential of S. occidentalis to control or compensate for diabetes and associated complications, with intentions to sensitize the scientific community for future research on this promising plant.", "Information on the anti-diabetic pharmacological studies of Senna occidentalis was collected from various scientific databases including Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. The studies were analyzed for the toxicological, phytochemical, anti-diabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemia and antioxidative aspects of the different parts of S. occidentalis.", "Numerous phytochemical constituents (flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, terpenes and glycosides) are present in this plant and are responsible for their anti-diabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidative effects. The different plant parts appears to exert anti-diabetic effects by direct regulation of blood glucose, modulation of lipid profile and improving of antioxidant status and islet function.", "Senna occidentalis is rich in phytochemicals. The crude extracts of the different parts have valuable bioactive properties with potential ethnopharmacological relevance for diabetes management and treatment. Further bioassay guided phytochemical analyses of this plant are recommended to explore its therapeutic bioactive principles."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
