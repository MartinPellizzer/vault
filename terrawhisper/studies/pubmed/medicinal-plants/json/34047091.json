It has the characteristics of large specific surface area and rich pores. In recent years, as a good soil conditioner, biochar has gradually improved its advantages in improving soil rhizosphere micro ecological environment, promoting plant growth and development, and enhancing plant resistance, etc. It has been proved that biochar can affect the growth and development of plants by improving soil physical and chemical properties, adjusting microbial community structure, participating in the metabolic process in plants, and inducing plants to enhance resistance. This paper summarized the research progress of biochar application in agriculture and introduced the ecological effects and mechanism of biochar on plant seed germination, seedling growth, crop yield and stress resistance. Combined with the characteristics of Chinese materia medica, this paper expounds the application potential of biochar in improving the content of secondary metabolites of Chinese materia medica and alleviating continuous cropping obstacles of Chinese materia medica, etc. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the research of biochar in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, allelopathy and heavy metal stress of medicinal plants, so as to provide reference for the application of biochar in the cultivation of Chinese materia medica."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan Ji'nan 250022, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Tong", "Initials": "XT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan Ji'nan 250022, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Zhi-Fang", "Initials": "ZF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan Ji'nan 250022, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biological Science and Technology, University of Jinan Ji'nan 250022, China School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Ji'nan 250355, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Lan-Ping", "Initials": "LP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "biochar"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16291-96-6", "NameOfSubstance": "Charcoal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Charcoal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "28", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "55"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34047091", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210123.107"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
