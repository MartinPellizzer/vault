Extracts prepared with solvents of different polarity did not show any cytotoxic effects against different strains of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and human T24 bladder cells under in vitro conditions. Significant antiadhesive activity against the bacterial attachment to human T24 bladder cells was found for an acetone extract (AAE) at concentrations >250\u03bcg/mL. More hydrophilic extracts did not influence the bacterial attachment to the eukaryotic host cells. Bioassay guided fractionation of AAE led to the identification of (E)-hexadecyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-acrylate (hexadecyl-coumaric acid ester) 1 as the compound responsible for inhibiting the UPEC adhesion to T24 bladder cells. 1 reduced the bacterial invasion into the bladder cells as shown by a specific invasion assay. Additionally, 1 was obtained by chemical synthesis, and also the synthetic structural analogs 2 and 3 were tested for their potential antiadhesive activity, indicating that a shorter alkyl chain at the ester function as well as the lack of hydroxylation of the phenyl moiety will abolish the antiadhesive activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
