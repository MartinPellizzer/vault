One of these strategies is the synthesis of a vast array of chemical compounds, known as specialized metabolites, that serve many ecological functions. Among the most fascinating and diverse groups of specialized metabolites are the alkaloids, which are characterized by the presence of a nitrogen atom within a heterocyclic ring. While some have medicinal and recreational applications, others are highly unpalatable and/or toxic. The effects of alkaloids on both humans and insects can be very diverse, affecting their physiology and behavior. Insects that feed on alkaloid-containing plants have evolved diverse mechanisms to cope with the consequences of these toxins. These include sequestration, where insects store alkaloids in specialized tissues or organs, enzymatic detoxification through enzymes such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases and glutathione S-transferases, and behavioral adaptations such as selective feeding. In this review, we explore the relationships between plant alkaloids and the evolutionary adaptations that enable insects to exploit alkaloid-rich plants as food sources and ecological niches minimizing the harmful effects of these natural compounds. We aim to provide a comprehensive and updated overview of this fascinating and complex ecological interaction."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
