Compounds 1-5 were evaluated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, which play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by in vitro spectrophotometric methods, while they were also screened for their antioxidant capacity in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, ferrous ion-chelating effect, and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) at 125, 250, 500, and 1000 microg ml(-1). All compounds exhibited a moderate inhibition against both BChE and LOX, whereas they were inactive towards AChE. The compounds displayed a great scavenging activity against DPPH especially at 500 and 1000 microg ml(-1). Besides, they were found to exert noteworthy reducing antioxidant power on ferric ions. In particular, the FRAP of compounds 2 (3.552 +/- 0.02), 4 (3.021 +/- 0.71), and 5 (3.533 +/- 0.01) were as high as that of the reference chlorogenic acid (3.618 +/- 0.01) at 1000 microg ml(-1). None of the compounds exhibited chelating ability against ferrous ions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Gazi University, 06330 Ankara, Turkey. nurgun@gazi.edu.tr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kucukboyaci", "ForeName": "Nurgun", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Orhan", "ForeName": "Ilkay", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sener", "ForeName": "Bilge", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nawaz", "ForeName": "S Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choudhary", "ForeName": "M Iqbal", "Initials": "MI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Naturforsch C J Biosci", "NlmUniqueID": "8912155", "ISSNLinking": "0341-0382"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Butyrylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "6", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20469636", "10.1515/znc-2010-3-404"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
