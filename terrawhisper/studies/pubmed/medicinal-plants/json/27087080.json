The patients of both genders were included. Blood urea, creatinine, ALT, Serum B12, CP, ESR and liver function tests were performed. The data was statistically analyzed in both groups for differential symptomatology. In anorexia test verses control results showed that Plantago ovata husk and placebo showed the affected ratio as 81 percent and 50 percent, correspondingly. Whereas in clinical performance of heart burning, pain in epigastrium, low libido, body pain, dyspepsia, fever, burning sensation in palm and sole in test drug showed affected response as adverse effect 90%, 88% and as control drug, 36%, 29%, 22%, 25%, 38%, 30%, 33%, 57%, respectively. The results were highly marked in test drug i.e. in comparison with placebo. This is clearly evident from data analysis that effect observed in test arm is far more superior hence null hypothesis was rejected clearly. Similarly serological and biochemical reports study i.e. (ALT, Vit. B1 and Vit A) revealed that there is no hepatotoxic and neurotoxic effect found in both the drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shifaul Mulk Memorial Hospital, Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University."}], "LastName": "Agha", "ForeName": "Rukh-e-Nasreen", "Initials": "RE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hamdard Research Institute of Unani Medicine (HIRUM), Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University."}], "LastName": "Saeed", "ForeName": "Aftab", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicine & Surgery, HACEM, Faculty of Eastern Medicine, Hamdard University."}], "LastName": "Nazar", "ForeName": "Halima", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Multicenter Study", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Laxatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diagnosis", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Constipation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Defecation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Laxatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Recovery of Function"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27087080"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
