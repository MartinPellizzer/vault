Subicho using a parsley MAP kinase gene as a heterologous probe. MK1 and MK2 encode stress-inducible protein kinases that can contribute to the response to wounding, UV-C, and cold. MK1 has a 92% amino acid identity with WIPK of tobacco. It was transcriptionally induced in response to wounding. In contrast, no detectable MK1 transcript was found in unwounded leaves of pepper. MK2 has a high level of amino acid homology to MAP kinases, such as NTF4 and SIPK and was constitutively expressed in all tissues. Both MK transcripts were downregulated by UV-C treatment. Each MK protein activation was independently wound-inducible in a cultivar dependent manner. MK1 is phosphorylated in cv. Pungchon but not cv. Subicho; whereas, the MK2 protein activation by wounding is restricted to cv. Subicho. In addition, de novo synthesis of the MK1 protein and tyrosine phosphorylation was rapidly and transiently induced in cv. Pungchon by wounding. In contrast, it is highly unlikely that the MK1 protein is produced in cv. Subicho, even though there is an abundant expression of MK1 mRNA after wounding in this cultivar. In Escherichia coli, which overexpresses MK1, autophosphorylation is observed at conserved threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Institute, Chonnam National University, Kwangju, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "D E", "Initials": "DE"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "D H", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K U", "Initials": "KU"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baik", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Back", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cells", "NlmUniqueID": "9610936", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8478"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "MK1 protein, Capsicum annuum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "WIPK protein, Nicotiana tabacum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11266120", "S1016-8478(23)17002-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
