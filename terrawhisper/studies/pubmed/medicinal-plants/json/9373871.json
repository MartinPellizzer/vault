The composition and water and oil absorption properties of the flour blends were evaluated. The biscuits and doughnuts made from each flour blend were evaluated organoleptically. The composite flour containing the highest proportion (50%) of A. africana seed flour contained the highest levels of protein and fat, exhibited the highest water absorption property but the lowest oil absorption capacity. Sensory scores showed high overall acceptability for products with a 10-30% level of substitution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Onweluzo", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morakinyo", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Plant Foods Hum Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8803554", "ISSNLinking": "0921-9668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flour"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "11", "Day": "28", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9373871", "10.1007/BF02436057"]}}]}
