In experiment 1, treatments were 1) direct-cut grass-legume forage without supplement, 2) direct-cut forage plus 10 kg DM of ground dry shelled corn-based concentrate, and 3) direct-cut forage plus 10 kg DM of coarsely ground high moisture ear corn-based concentrate. In experiment 2, treatments were 1) direct-cut grass-legume forage plus 10 kg DM of ground dry shelled corn-based concentrate, 2) direct-cut forage plus 10 kg DM of coarsely ground high moisture ear corn-based concentrate, and 3) direct-cut forage plus 10 kg of DM finely ground high moisture ear corn-based concentrate. Both experiments were designed as 3 x 3 Latin squares replicated three times. In experiment 1, yields of milk and milk protein increased with concentrate supplementation, but were not affected by source of corn. Solids-corrected milk yield tended to increase with grain supplementation. Dry matter intake increased with concentrate supplementation, but was not affected by source of corn or corn particle size. Corn supplements decreased ruminal pH and acetate to propionate ratio and increased ruminal propionate concentration. Grain supplements reduced ruminal ammonia concentration, increased concentration of urine allantoin, and increased the urinary allantoin to creatinine ratio. In the second study, fine grinding of high moisture corn reduced fecal starch plus free glucose levels and tended to increase its apparent digestibility. In both experiments, starch plus free glucose intake was higher on the diets with dry corn, but its utilization was not affected by source of corn."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dairy Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reis", "ForeName": "R B", "Initials": "RB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Emeterio", "ForeName": "F S", "Initials": "FS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Combs", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Satter", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Costa", "ForeName": "H N", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Milk Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Dairying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Milk Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11233028", "10.3168/jds.s0022-0302(01)74493-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
