Astragaloside III (AS-III) has immunomodulatory effects and is one of the most active components in AM. However, its underlying mechanism of action is still not fully explained.", "The research was designed to discuss the protective effects of AS-III on immunosuppression and to elucidate its prospective mechanism.", "Molecular docking methods and network pharmacology analysis were used to comprehensively investigate potential targets and relative pathways for AS-III and immunosuppression. In order to study and verify the pharmacological activity and mechanism of AS-III in alleviating immunosuppression, immunosuppression mouse model induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX) in vivo and macrophage RAW264.7\u00a0cell model induced by hypoxia/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro were used.", "A total of 105 common targets were obtained from the AS-III-related and immunosuppression-related target networks. The results of network pharmacology and molecular docking demonstrate that AS-III may treat immunosuppression through by regulating glucose metabolism-related pathways such as regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, central carbon metabolism in cancer together with HIF-1 pathway. The results of molecular docking showed that AS-III has good binding relationship with LDHA, AKT1 and HIF1A. In CTX-induced immunosuppressive mouse model, AS-III had a significant protective effect on the reduction of body weight, immune organ index and hematological indices. It can also protect immune organs from damage. In addition, AS-III could significantly improve the expression of key proteins involved in energy metabolism and serum inflammatory factors. To further validate the animal results, an initial inflammatory/immune response model of macrophage RAW264.7\u00a0cells was constructed through hypoxia and LPS. AS-III improved the immune function of macrophages, reduced the release of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, PDHK-1, LDH, lactate, HK, PK and GLUT-1, and restored the decrease of ATP caused by hypoxia. Besides, AS-III was also demonstrated that it could inhibit the increase of HIF-1\u03b1, PDHK-1 and LDH by adding inhibitors and agonists.", "In this study, the main targets of AS-III for immunosuppressive therapy were initially analyzed. AS-III was systematically confirmed to attenuates immunosuppressive state through the HIF-1\u03b1/PDHK-1 pathway. These findings offer an experimental foundation for the use of AS-III as a potential candidate for the treatment of immunosuppression."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.
