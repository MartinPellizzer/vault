Here, we demonstrate the dimethylallylation, geranylation, and farnesylation, particularly the first dimethylallylation at the nonaromatic carbon of phloretin (<b>1</b>) by the fungal prenyltransferase AnaPT and its mutants. F265 was identified as a key amino acid residue related to dimethylallylation at the nonaromatic carbon of phloretin. Mutants AnaPT_F265D, AnaPT_F265G, AnaPT_F265P, AnaPT_F265C, and AnaPT_F265Y were discovered to generally increase prenylation activity toward <b>1</b>. AnaPT_F265G catalyzes the <i>O</i>-geranylation selectively at the C-2' hydroxyl group, which involves an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of <b>1</b>. Seven products, <b>1D5</b>, <b>1D7-1D9</b>, <b>1G2</b>, <b>1G4</b>, and <b>1F2</b>, have not been reported prior to this study. Twelve compounds, <b>1D3-1D9</b>, <b>1G1-1G3</b>, and <b>1F1-1F2</b>, exhibited potential inhibitory effects on \u03b1-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 11.45 \u00b1 0.87 to 193.80 \u00b1 6.52 \u03bcg/mL. Among them, <b>1G1</b> with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 11.45 \u00b1 0.87 \u03bcg/mL was the most potential \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor, which is about 30 times stronger than the positive control acarbose with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 346.63 \u00b1 15.65 \u03bcg/mL."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Yanzhi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Linlan", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yunyun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}], "LastName": "Ran", "ForeName": "Qianqian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Dan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4583-2655"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut f\u00fcr Pharmazeutische Biologie und Biotechnologie, Fachbereich Pharmazie, Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Robert-Koch-Str. 4, Marburg 35037, Germany."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Shu-Ming", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2429-347X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Central South University, Changsha 410013, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Xia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3550-161X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Chun-Mao", "Initials": "CM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6826-987X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Key Laboratory of Plant Resource Conservation and Germplasm Innovation in Mountainous Region, Ministry of Education, Guizhou University, Guiyang 550025, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Kang", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "S5J5OE47MK", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloretin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylallyltranstransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phloretin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylallyltranstransferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prenylation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38557039", "10.1021/acs.jafc.4c00928"]}}]}
