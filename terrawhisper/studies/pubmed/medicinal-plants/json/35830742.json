The proposed method was found to be suitable for the detection of aflatoxins in eight kinds of herbs and their corresponding granules. Two batches of Arecae semen were positive for aflatoxins, with high residue levels of different aflatoxins. To better understand the presence and transfer of aflatoxins during the formulation of dispensing granules from the herbs, the aflatoxins-free herbs were artificially inoculated with Aspergillus flavus to explore aflatoxins production. Both aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> and aflatoxin B<sub>2</sub> were detected in all inoculated samples, while aflatoxin G<sub>2</sub> was only detected in Astragali radix samples. Additionally, the presence of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> was extremely high compared to other aflatoxins. More specifically, the transfer rate of the aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> and the total aflatoxins from original herbs to granules were both approximately 40%. These findings indicated that the preparation of herbs into dispensing granules reduced the content of aflatoxins. The high-level presence of aflatoxins in inoculated herbs indicated that attention is needed to the safety of A. flavus-contaminated herbs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yudan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, P.\u00a0R.\u00a0China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, P.
