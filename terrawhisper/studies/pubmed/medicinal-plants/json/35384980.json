Medicinal plants have been used for human health benefits for several years, but their therapeutic potential needs to be explored. The main objective of this study was to figure out the in vitro antiviral and anticancer characteristics of total crude protein of Iberis gibraltarica against HCV and HCC. Total crude protein of Iberis gibraltarica was isolated and quantified. The level of cytotoxicity was measured against the HepG2 cell line and it shows no significant cytotoxicity at the concentration of 504\u00b5g/ml. The anti-HCV effect was determined by absolute quantification via real time RT-PCR method and viral titer was reduced up to 66% in a dose dependent manner against the total protein of Iberis gibraltarica. The anticancer potential of Iberis gibraltarica was also examined through mRNA expression studies of AFP and GPC3 genes against the total protein of Iberis gibraltarica-treated HepG2 cells. The results show up to 90% of the down-regulation expression of AFP and GPC3. The obtained results indicate the therapeutic potential of total protein of Iberis gibraltarica against HCV and hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2546-1199"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bilal", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1172-5117"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bashir", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6892-1311"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ameen", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6321-0038"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sumrin", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4860-2820"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hussain", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6407-6969"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of the Punjab, Faculty of Life-Sciences, Center for Applied Molecular Biology, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Manzoor", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "GPC3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glypicans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Fetoproteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brassicaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glypicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hepatitis C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Fetoproteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "6", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35384980", "10.1590/1519-6984.252676", "S1519-69842024000100259"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
