Moench and Echinacea angustifolia (DC.) Hell, grown in the same soil, as well as the bacterial community from their rhizospheric soils. Molecular PCR-based techniques were applied to cultivable bacteria isolated from the three compartments of the two plants. The results showed that the two plants and their respective compartments were characterized by different communities, indicating a low degree of strain sharing and a strong selective pressure within plant tissues. Pseudomonas was the most highly represented genus, together with Actinobacteria and Bacillus spp. The presence of distinct bacterial communities in different plant species and among compartments of the same plant species could account for the differences in the medicinal properties of the two plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Spanish Society for Microbiology and Institute for Catalan Studies."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agrobiology and Pedology Research Center, Agricultural Research Council, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Chiellini", "ForeName": "Carolina", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Maida", "ForeName": "Isabel", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Trees and Timber Institute National Research Council, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Emiliani", "ForeName": "Giovanni", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mengoni", "ForeName": "Alessio", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agrobiology and Pedology Research Center, Agricultural Research Council, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mocali", "ForeName": "Stefano", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agrobiology and Pedology Research Center, Agricultural Research Council, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fabiani", "ForeName": "Arturo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botanical Garden, Casola Valsenio, Italy."}], "LastName": "Biffi", "ForeName": "Sauro", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Maggini", "ForeName": "Valentina", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gori", "ForeName": "Luigi", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Vannacci", "ForeName": "Alfredo", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Gallo", "ForeName": "Eugenia", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Integrative Medicine, Careggi University Hospital, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Firenzuoli", "ForeName": "Fabio", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."}], "LastName": "Fani", "ForeName": "Renato", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Int Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9816585", "ISSNLinking": "1139-6709"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizosphere"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil Microbiology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2014", "Month": "9", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26419456", "10.2436/20.1501.01.219"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
