Zinc availability relative to zinc chloride depended on the amount of the zinc source in the test meal. Zinc availability from several foods was similar to that from zinc chloride when tested in smaller amounts, but enhanced when fed in larger amounts. The range of zinc availability was similar for foods of plant and animal origin. Rats retained significantly more zinc from pork, chicken, peanut butter, egg or milk than from rice, beef, soybean flour or navy beans. Foods with intermediate zinc availability were sweet corn, whole wheat bread, cheese and oysters. Several food characteristics were examined for possible relationships with zinc availability, including the solubility or molecular size of zinc compounds after an in vitro enzymatic digestion and the contents of phytic acid, minerals, amino acids, carbohydrate and fatty acids relative to the zinc content of the food. Protein and several amino acids predicted about half of the variance in zinc availability. Following in vitro enzymatic digestion, neither zinc solubility nor the partitioning of zinc between low and high molecular weight substances was a strong predictor of zinc availability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, ND 58202."}], "LastName": "Hunt", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Swan", "ForeName": "P B", "Initials": "PB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7IGF0S7R8I", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "86Q357L16B", "NameOfSubstance": "zinc chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bread"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairy Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3681482", "10.1093/jn/117.11.1913"]}}]}
