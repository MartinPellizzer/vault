The confirmation of its potential transmission by Aedes aegypti and recent cases in Brazil, mainly in large centers in the northern region, led to the classification of Mayaro fever as an emerging disease. Traditional medicine is commonly used to treat various diseases, mainly by local riverside populations. Some species of the genus Maytenus, which have similar morphologies, are popularly used to treat infections and inflammations. In this context, our research group has studied and confirmed the antiviral activity of several plant-derived compounds. However, several species of this same genus have not been studied and therefore deserve attention.", "This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of ethyl acetate extracts of leaves (LAE) and branches (TAE) of Maytenus quadrangulata against MAYV.", "Mammalian cells (Vero cells) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the extracts. After cell infection by MAYV and the treatment with the extracts, we evaluated the selectivity index (SI), the virucidal effect, viral adsorption and internalization, and the effect on viral gene expression. The antiviral action was confirmed by quantifying the viral genome using RT-qPCR and by analyzing the effect on virus yield in infected cells. The treatment was performed based on the effective concentration protective for 50% of the infected cells (EC<sub>50</sub>).", "The leaves (LAE; EC<sub>50</sub> 12.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and branches (TAE; EC<sub>50</sub> 101.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) extracts showed significative selectivity against the virus, with SI values of 79.21 and 9.91, respectively, which were considered safe. Phytochemical analysis revealed that the antiviral action was associated with the presence of catechins, mainly in LAE. This extract was chosen for the subsequent studies since it reduced the viral cytopathic effect and virus production, even at high viral loads [MOI (multiplicity of infection) 1 and 5]. The effects of LAE resulted in a marked reduction in viral gene expression. The viral title was drastically reduced when LAE was added to the virus before infection or during replication stages, reducing virus production up to 5-log units compared to infected and untreated cells.", "Through kinetic replication, MAYV was not detected in Vero cells treated with LAE throughout the viral cycle. The virucidal effect of LAE inactivates the viral particle and can intercept the virus at the end of the cycle when it gains the extracellular environment. Therefore, LAE is a promising source of antiviral agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
