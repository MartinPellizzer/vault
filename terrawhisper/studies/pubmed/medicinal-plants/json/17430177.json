The unique properties of DXR make it a remarkable and rational target for drug design. First, it is a vital enzyme for synthesis of isoprenoids in algae, plants, several eubacteria including the pathogenic bacteria like Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori, Yersinia pestis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Second, there are no functional equivalents to DXR in humans, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Third, DXR appears to be a valid target and the results from fosmidomycin (1), the only available DXR inhibitor under clinical trials, suggests synergistic effects with the lincosamide antibiotics, lincomycin and clindamycin. Despite drug design efforts in this area, no successful drug specifically designed to inhibit DXR has emerged yet. This review summarizes the recent and promising developments with respect to the current knowledge of the MEP pathway with emphasis on the understanding of the structure and the catalytic mechanism of the DXR enzyme and the global quest for therapeutically useful inhibitors of DXR."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Laboratory for Applied Drug Design and Synthesis, School of Pharmacy, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677-1848, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Nidhi", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chev\u00e9", "ForeName": "Gweneal", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avery", "ForeName": "Mitchell A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McCurdy", "ForeName": "Christopher R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Des", "NlmUniqueID": "9602487", "ISSNLinking": "1381-6128"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Phosphates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.267", "NameOfSubstance": "1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.3.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldose-Ketose Isomerases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RA96B954X6", "NameOfSubstance": "Erythritol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aldose-Ketose Isomerases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythritol"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Multienzyme Complexes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Phosphates"}], "NumberOfReferences": "139"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17430177", "10.2174/138161207780618939"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
