A prevailing theory in ME toxicity is its ability to be metabolically activated by P450 enzymes and sulfotransferases, which initiates sequential reactions of the resulting metabolites with functional biomolecules. The present study aimed at a potential interaction between the reactive metabolites of ME and RNA. Cultured mouse primary hepatocytes were incubated with ME followed by RNA extraction and NaOH and alkaline phosphatase-based RNA hydrolysis. Three adenosine adducts were detected in the hydrolytic mixture by LC-MS/MS. The same adenosine adducts were also detected in hepatic tissues harvested from ME-treated mice. These three adducts were chemically synthesized and structurally characterized by <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Additionally, two guanosine adducts and one cytidine adduct were detected in the <i>in vivo</i> samples. These results provided solid evidence that the reactive metabolites of ME attacked RNA, resulting in RNA adduction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou 550004, P.
