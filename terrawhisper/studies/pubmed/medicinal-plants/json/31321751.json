Candida spp. are the most common yeasts involved in these disorders, being associated with a high rate of antifungal resistance and an increased ability to form biofilms, which make the treatment of these infections difficult. This review aims to present and discuss the main biofilm-related infections cause by several Candida spp. and novel therapies that are currently available in the clinical, scientific and academic environment. New drugs with promising antifungal activity, natural approaches (e.g. probiotics, essential oils, plant extracts, honey) and a final consideration on alternative methodologies, such as photodynamic therapy are presented and discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Virology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University in Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia."}], "LastName": "\u010cern\u00e1kov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Binghamton Biofilm Research Center, Freshman Research Immersion Program, Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Light", "ForeName": "Catilin", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Bam University of Medical Sciences, Bam, Iran. bahar.salehi007@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Bahare", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile."}], "LastName": "Rogel-Castillo", "ForeName": "Cristian", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile."}], "LastName": "Victoriano", "ForeName": "Montserrat", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile."}], "LastName": "Martorell", "ForeName": "Miquel", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zabol Medicinal Plants Research Center, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran. javad.sharifirad@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. ncmartins@med.up.pt."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. ncmartins@med.up.pt."}], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "Nat\u00e1lia", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "LEPABE - Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. c.fortunae@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Rodrigues", "ForeName": "C\u00e9lia F", "Initials": "CF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Exp Med Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0121103", "ISSNLinking": "0065-2598"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Fungal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photochemotherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31321751", "10.1007/5584_2019_400"]}}]}
