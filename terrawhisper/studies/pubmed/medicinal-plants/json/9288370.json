The species were classified according to Chinese ethnopharmacological groups, and these were compared to Brazilian ones. According to the principles proposed by the author, 122 species existing in Brazil could be related to the Chinese species (14.35% of the samples). In this comparison, 62.27% of the plants had similar ethnopharmacological use. Comparison between the ethnopharmacological groups showed some similarity in 91.60%. Pharmacological actions disclosed by research also showed concordance with ethnopharmacological uses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "IARJ-(Acupuncture Institute of Rio de Janeiro), CEP, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Botsaris", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9288370", "10.1142/S0192415X97000263", "S0192415X97000263"]}}]}
