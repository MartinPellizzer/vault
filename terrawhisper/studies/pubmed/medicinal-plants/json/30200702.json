Comparing to Se or polysaccharides, Se polysaccharides exhibit improved biological activities and are more prone to be absorbed by human bodies, therefore, they have been widely used in medical applications, such as immunomodulation, anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-aging. Due to their unique pharmacological activities, Se polysaccharides from medicinal plants have gradually become a research hotspot. However, only a few of Se polysaccharides have been separated and purified in recent years. The structure of polysaccharides is also very complex, therefore, determination of the chemical structure and mechanism of bioactivity of Se polysaccharide in vivo remain to be further studied. This article systematically introduced the main source and biological activities of Se polysaccharides from medicinal plants. The purpose of this review is to provide a basis for the further research of Se polysaccharides."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Huan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jin", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for New Rural Development, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Meng-Liang", "Initials": "ML"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30200702", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180426.002"]}}]}
