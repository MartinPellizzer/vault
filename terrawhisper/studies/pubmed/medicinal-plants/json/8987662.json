Dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain was isolated by a simple method without chromatography from the leaves of Alpinia speciosa K. SCHUM. The white crystalline compound obtained was identified as dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain (1) by instrumental analyses. 4-Hydroxy-6-(2-phenylethyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (3) was prepared by hydrolyzing dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain. Three dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain derivatives were synthesized by reacting 3 with phosphoric agents. Among the synthesized compounds, dimethyl [6-(2-phenylethyl)-2-oxo-2H-pyran-4-yl]phosphorothionate (4) had the strongest antifungal activity of 91% at 100 ppm against Corticium rolfsii."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tawata", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Taira", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobamoto", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishihara", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Toyama", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3155-51-9", "NameOfSubstance": "7,8-dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8987662", "10.1271/bbb.60.1643"]}}]}
