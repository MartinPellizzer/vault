Mycoflora analysis of the dry fruits revealed Aspergillus favus LHP-PV-1 as the most aflatoxigenic isolate with highest Aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> content. M.\u00a0cardiaca EO showed broad fungitoxic spectrum inhibiting the tested moulds contaminating dry fruits. It's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum aflatoxin inhibitory concentration (MAIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) against A.\u00a0favus LHP-PV-1 were recorded to be 1.25, 1.0 and 2.25 \u00b5L/mL respectively. The EO caused decrease in ergosterol content and enhanced leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions from treated fungal cells, depicting fungal plasma membrane as the site of antifungal action. The EO showed promising DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC<sub>50</sub> value:15.89 \u00b5L/mL) and favourable safety profile with LD<sub>50</sub> value (7133.70\u00a0mg/kg body wt.) when estimated through acute oral toxicity on mice. Carvone (61.62%) was recorded as the major component of the oil during chemical characterisation through GC-MS. Based on strong antifungal, antiaflatoxigenic and antioxidant potential, the chemically characterised M.\u00a0cardiaca EO may be recommended as safe plant based preservative and shelf life enhancer of food items. This is the first report on antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activity of M.\u00a0cardiaca EO."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.
