The purified pigments were red, purple, and blue at acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH values, respectively. Physical stability of the purified pigments against heat and light in an aqueous solution was examined for possible value-added food colorants. The thermal degradation reactions were carried out at pH 3.0 (50 mM glycine buffer) in 50% EtOH/H(2)O. Deoxyshikonin (t(1/2) = 14.6 h, 60 degrees C) and isobutylshikinin (t(1/2) = 19.3 h, 60 degrees C) are relatively less stable than other shikonin derivatives (t(1/2) = 40-50 h, 60 degrees C). Activation energies of thermal degradation of the isolated pigments were calculated. The activation energy of deoxyshikonin was the highest (12.5 kcal mol(-)(1)) and that of beta-hydroxyisovalerylshikonin was the lowest (1.71 kcal mol(-)(1)) value. Light stabilities of the pigments were similar to each other in that the half-life values of photodegradation for 20000 lx light intensity were 4.2-5.1 h."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Suwon 449-701,Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Paik", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hahn", "ForeName": "T R", "Initials": "TR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3IK6592UBW", "NameOfSubstance": "shikonin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Stability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Korea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Naphthoquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Pigments, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10552776", "10.1021/jf9902853", "jf9902853"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
