The extract was obtained from the drying of a hydro-alcoholic extract with drying aid (40% of colloidal SiO2 related to solid content in the concentrated extract, at a concentration of 15.82% in water). The drying conditions employed were: Temperature of the spouting gas 150 degrees C, feed flow-rate of hydro-alcoholic extract 16.0 g/min, feed flow rate of the spouting gas 1.67 m3/min and static bed height 7.0 cm. Wistar rats received three different doses (140, 280 and 420 mg/kg) of the dried extract by intraperitoneal way and, after 60 minutes, were immobilized with wire screen and placed at temperature of 4 degrees C for two hours (cold-restraint stress). The animals were sacrificed and the stomach removed, examined and the volume and pH of the gastric secretion determined. A significant reduction in the ulceration index, was observed as well as a significant increase of the volume and of the pH of the gastric secretion for all doses administered. This is an indication that the preparation of dried extracts by the Jet spouted bed technique does not alter the biological activity of Maytenus ilicifolia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Psicobiologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tabach", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "W P", "Initials": "WP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "80061L1WGD", "NameOfSubstance": "Cimetidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Ulcer Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Physical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cimetidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Desiccation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Acidity Determination"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Gastric Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Maytenus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12967037"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
