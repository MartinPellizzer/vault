The structures of new compounds were elucidated by the use of 1D/2D NMR spectroscopic data. The absolute configurations of bletitrins A and B were determined by optical rotation value. Compounds 13-16 were isolated from the Orchidaceae for the first time. Most of the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against three gram-positive bacterial strains and one gram-negative bacterial strain. Compounds 4, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 18 showed potent inhibitory activities, with MICs of (6-52\u202f\u03bcg/mL) against S. aureus ATCC 6538."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
