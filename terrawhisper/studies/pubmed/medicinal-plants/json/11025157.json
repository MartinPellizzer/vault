A total of 122 traditional Chinese medicinal plants, selected according to the clinical efficacy and prescription frequency for the treatment of gout and other hyperuricemia-related disorders, have been evaluated for the enzyme inhibitory activity. Among the 122 methanol extracts derived from these species, 69 were shown to be inhibitory at 100 microg/ml, with 29 having greater than 50% inhibition. As to the equal amount of water extracts, 40 were disclosed to be active at 100 microg/ml, with 13 possessing more than 50% inhibition. At 50 microg/ml, 58 methanol and 24 water extracts exhibited inhibitory activity, with 15 of the former and two of the latter showing greater than 50% inhibition. The most active was the methanol extract of the twig of Cinnamomum cassia (Lauraceae) (IC(50), 18 microg/ml), which was followed immediately by those of the flower of Chrysanthemum indicum (Asteraceae) (IC(50), 22 microg/ml) and the leaves of Lycopus europaeus (Lamiatae) (IC(50), 26 microg/ml). Among the water extracts, the strongest inhibition of the enzyme was observed with that of the rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum (Polygonaceae) (IC(50), 38 microg/ml). The IC(50) value of allopurinol used as a positive control was 1.06 microg/ml. The study demonstrated that the effects for these medicinal plants used for the gout treatment were based, at least in part, on the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Functional Biomolecule, State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 210093, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cai", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "W W", "Initials": "WW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "C H", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tan", "ForeName": "R X", "Initials": "RX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Gout"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11025157", "10.1016/s0378-8741(00)00305-6", "S0378-8741(00)00305-6"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
