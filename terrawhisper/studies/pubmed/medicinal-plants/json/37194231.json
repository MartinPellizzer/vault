Chemopreventive drugs either prevent DNA damage, which results in malignancy, or they stop or reverse the division of premalignant cells with DNA damage, which inhibits the growth of cancer. There is an obvious need for an alternate strategy given the ongoing rise in cancer incidence, the ineffectiveness of traditional chemotherapies to control cancer, and the excessive toxicity of chemotherapies. From antiquity to date, the saga of the usage of plants as medicine has been the mainstay among people worldwide. In recent years, extensive studies have been conducted on medicinal plants, spices, and nutraceuticals, as these have gained much popularity in reducing the risk of several cancer types in humans. Extensive studies on cell culture systems and animal models have demonstrated that various medicinal plants and nutraceuticals from various natural resources and their products, such as major polyphenolic constituents, flavones, flavonoids, antioxidants, etc, provide considerable protection against many cancer types. As shown in the literatures, the major aim of studies conducted is to develop preventive/therapeutic agents which can induce apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Projects are going on worldwide to find better ways to eradicate the disease. The study of phytomedicines has shed new light on this topic as research to date has proven that they have antiproliferative and apoptotic capabilities that will aid in the development of novel cancer prevention options. Dietary substances, such as Baicalein, Fisetin, and Biochanin A have shown that they have an inhibitory effect on cancer cells, suggesting that they may work as chemopreventive agents. This review discusses the chemopreventive and anticancer mechanisms of such reported natural compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Rais", "ForeName": "Juhi", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Molecular Endocrinology Lab, University of Lucknow, Lucknow, 226007, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Habiba", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, 202002, U.P., India."}], "LastName": "Arshad", "ForeName": "Mohd", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "OO2ABO9578", "NameOfSubstance": "fisetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "49QAH60606", "NameOfSubstance": "baicalein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U13J6U390T", "NameOfSubstance": "biochanin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37194231", "10.2174/1568026623666230516161827", "CTMC-EPUB-131843"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
