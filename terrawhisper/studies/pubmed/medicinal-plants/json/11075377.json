Peroxide values and free fatty acids values of weaning food formulas reached to its maximum after 3 and 2 months, respectively, and after that continuously decreased during storage. Thio-barbituric acid values of all samples increased gradually throughout the storage period at different condition of storage (room temperature and refrigerator). The protein in-vitro digestibility of all samples was not affected during storage. Protein solubility index in distilled water, 5% NaCl and 5% sucrose decreased with different obvious rates, but bulk density of weaning food formula decreased within a very narrow ranges during storage period. Total bacterial counts as well as yeast and molds decreased gradually throughout the storage period at different conditions of storage, and cold stored samples became free from molds and yeast after 6 months of storage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Menofiya University, Faculty of Agriculture, Food Science and Technology Department, Shibin El-Kom, Egypt."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "el-Adawy", "ForeName": "T A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rahma", "ForeName": "E H", "Initials": "EH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "el-Bedawy", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sobihah", "ForeName": "T Y", "Initials": "TY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Nahrung", "NlmUniqueID": "0142530", "ISSNLinking": "0027-769X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fatty Acids, Nonesterified"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dairy Products"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fatty Acids, Nonesterified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11075377", "10.1002/1521-3803(20001001)44:5<344::AID-FOOD344>3.0.CO;2-8"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
