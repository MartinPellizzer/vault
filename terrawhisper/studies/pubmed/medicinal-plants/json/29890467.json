In particular, inhaled airborne particulate matter <2.5\u202f\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) can rapidly diffuse from the lungs to the systemic blood circulation and accumulate in the liver. In this study, we used a Balb/c mouse model to investigate liver injury caused by PM<sub>2.5</sub> inhalation and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of compound essential oils (CEOs) in alleviating the extent of this injury. The results of serum biochemical and histopathological analyses showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure induced inflammatory liver injury, meantime CEOs pretreatment attenuated PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced liver inflammatory injury. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> increased secretion of cytokines, however CEOs suppressed the production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) and superoxide dismutase-1(SOD-1) expression levels showed that PM<sub>2.5</sub> could trigger oxidative stress-mediated liver injury, whereas CEOs pretreatment might protect against PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced liver injury through regulation of the antioxidant system. Molecular analysis showed that the expression of TLR4, a protein which plays a key role in liver health and injury. Results showed that TLR4 was promoted by PM<sub>2.5</sub> but inhibited by CEOs pretreatment in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced inflammatory liver injury. In addition, PM<sub>2.5</sub>-promoted secretion of cytokines by activating TLR4/MyD88 pathway, whereas CEOs might alleviate this type of liver inflammation inhibiting the activation of TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.
