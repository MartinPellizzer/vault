These drugs have some disadvantages, including their efficacy only in the acute or early infection phases, adverse effects during their use, and the resistance that the parasite has developed to their activity. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new, safe and effective therapeutic alternatives to treat Chagas disease, though governments and the pharmaceutical industry have shown a lack of interest in contributing to this solution. Institutions and research groups on the other hand have worked on some strategies that can help to address the problem. Some of these include the modification of conventional drug dosages, drug repurposing, and combined therapy. Plants and derived compounds with antiparasitic effects have also been studied, taking advantage of traditional medicinal knowledge. Others have studied the parasite to identify essential genes that can be used as therapeutic targets to design new, targeted drugs. Some of these studies have generated promising results, but few reach clinical phase studies. Institutions and research groups should be encouraged to unify efforts and cover all aspects of drug development according to resources and knowledge availability. In the end, this exchange of knowledge would lead to the development of new therapeutic alternatives to treat Chagas disease and benefit the populations it affects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
