Brown algae have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-fungal, antioxidant, and immune-boosting properties. This study investigated the antioxidant properties and the effect of brown algae extract on pancreatic and uterine cancer cells.", "In this study, Cervical (Hela) and pancreas (Paca-2) cancer cell lines were examined. The algae materials were extracted by sequential maceration method and amount of fucoxanthin content in the sample was determined by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. The cytotoxic effect of different concentrations of brown algae was measured by the MTT assay. All statistical calculations for comparing IC<sub>50</sub> were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism software.", "the algal sample contained an average of 102.52 \u00b1 0.12\u00a0\u03bcg of fucoxanthin per 100\u00a0g. IC<sub>50</sub> for 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide free radical scavenging activity for methanolic extract was 2.02 and 11.98 \u00b1 0.13 respectively. Brown algae in all fractions inhibited cell growth and survival. In Hela cell lines, the methanolic extract was the most effective inhibitor, while in Paca cell lines, hexane and methanolic extracts were particularly potent. The methanolic extract was more toxic than other fractions on Hela and Paca cell lines.", "This study highlights brown algae extracts strong anticancer effects on uterine and pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a natural anticancer drug. Different fractions of the extract showed superior apoptotic and cytotoxic effects, with higher concentrations leading to increased apoptotic effects and reduced survival rates of cancer cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0006-9225-5140"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["92948"], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amerifar", "ForeName": "Milad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0009-0002-2041-0253"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["114456"], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Arabnozari", "ForeName": "Hesamoddin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["92948"], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Hemoglobinopathy Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shokrzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7367-1484"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["92948"], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Habibi", "ForeName": "Emran", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Hum Exp Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "9004560", "ISSNLinking": "0960-3271"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "06O0TC0VSM", "NameOfSubstance": "fucoxanthin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthophylls"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pancreatic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phaeophyceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xanthophylls"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of conflicting interestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "21", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38238028", "10.1177/09603271241227228"]}}]}
