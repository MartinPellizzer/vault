It is clear that an important role is occupied by polyphenol, phenolic compounds and others. Urine is an effective biofluid to evaluate and monitor alterations in homeostasis and other processes related to metabolism. The current review provides a detailed description of the formation of urine in human body, various aspects relevant to sampling and analysis of urinary metabolites before presenting recent developments leveraging on metabolite profiling of urine. For the profiling of small molecules in urine, advancement of liquid chromatography mass tandem spectrometry (LC/MS/MS), establishment of standardized chemical fragmentation libraries, computational resources, data-analysis approaches with pattern recognition tools have made it an attractive option. The profiling of urinary metabolites gives an overview of the biomarkers associated with the diet and evaluates its biological effects. Metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, purine metabolism and others can be evaluated. Finally, a combination of metabolite profiling with chemical standardization and bioassay in functional food and medicinal plants will likely lead to the identification of new biomarkers and novel biochemical insights."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore, Republic of Singapore."}], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "16", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "56"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37454386", "10.1080/10408347.2023.2235442"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
