However, the phylogenetic relationships within the clade remain debated, and comprehensive analyses of codon usage and selection pressure in Telephium plastomes are limited. In this study, we assembled and annotated four plastomes and performed extensive analyses. The plastomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure and high conservation. The lengths ranged from 151,357\u00a0bp to 151,641\u00a0bp with 134 genes identified. The GC content was the highest within IR, followed by LSC, and lowest in the SSC region. Meanwhile, a unique inversion was observed within the LSC region of Meterostachys sikokianus. Polymorphisms analysis revealed minimum nucleotide diversity in the IR regions, with over ten highly polymorphic regions identified. Phylogenetically, two subclades formed within the monophyletic Telephium clade, with Umbilicus as the sister group to the remaining Hylotelephium subclade members. Notably, no significant positive selection was found among the 79 plastid genes, which showed varying evolutionary patterns. However, 19 genes contained codons under positive selection. The specific functions of these sites require further investigation. Synonymous codon usage was biased and conserved across the tested plastomes, shaped by natural selection, mutations and other factors of varying influence. We also identified 34 taxon-specific codon aversion motifs from 49 plastid genes. Our plastomic analyses elucidate phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary patterns in this medicinal clade, providing a foundation for further research on these ecologically and pharmaceutically important plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
