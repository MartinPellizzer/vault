AR-arabinogalactan was composed of arabinose and galactose in a molar ratio of 1.2:1.0 and a small amount of galacturonic acid. The results of methylation and exo-alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase treatment showed that the polysaccharide was a branched arabinogalactan containing a backbone involving galactopyranosyl (1----6) linkages. Most of the arabinose was present as an alpha-L-furanosyl residue in the non-reducing terminals and side chains. The (1----3)-linked galactopyranosyl residue might be linked to the arabinosyl side chains. alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase digestion did not destroy the anti-complementary activity of the polysaccharide. After incubation of the serum with AR-arabinogalactan in the absence of Ca2+ ions, a cleavage of C3 in the serum was detected by immunoelectrophoresis as well as from the consumption of complement when rabbit erythrocytes were used in the assay system. A marked consumption of C4 was also observed to have occurred when serum was incubated with AR-arabinogalactan in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Collectively considered these results indicate that the mode of complement activation by AR-arabinogalactan is via both the alternative and the classical pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamada", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kiyohara", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cyong", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otsuka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Mol Immunol", "NlmUniqueID": "7905289", "ISSNLinking": "0161-5890"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement C4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "B40ROO395Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Arabinose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SL4SX1O487", "NameOfSubstance": "arabinogalactan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X2RN3Q8DNE", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Arabinose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Complement C4"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Inactivator Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Galactans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Galactose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4000133", "10.1016/0161-5890(85)90165-8"]}}]}
