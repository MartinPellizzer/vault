Four dual-cannulated (rumen and proximal duodenum) cows were randomly assigned to two groups to graze mixed cool season grass legume pasture with either no supplement or with 6.4 kg of cracked corn and mineral mix daily in a switchback design with three 2-wk periods. Markers (Cr2O3 and Co-EDTA) were used to estimate intake, duodenal flow, fecal output, and fractional rates of passage from the rumen. Daily OM intake was similar between diets, but OM intake of pasture was lower when cows were fed corn. Apparent OM and NDF digestibilities in the rumen and total digestive tract were lower when cows were supplemented with corn than when they consumed pasture only. Supplemental corn decreased ruminal NH3 N (22 vs. 17 mg/dl) and increased N recovery at the duodenum (86% vs. 75% of N intake). Nonammonia, nonmicrobial N flowing to the duodenum was 67% of the total NAN flow. Corn increased energy intake of grazing cows, but decreased herbage intake and digestibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Dairy Science, Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg 24061-0315, USA."}], "LastName": "Berzaghi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Herbein", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Polan", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Duodenum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8899524", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76520-7", "S0022-0302(96)76520-7"]}}]}
