Biological assays were conducted with the aqueous extracts of P. quinquefolius, Fructus Perillae and roots of Coix lacryma-jobi. P. quinquefolium was cultivated in the soil where purple Perilla frutesens and C. lacryma-jobi were grown previously. The effects of rotation were determined.", "The stems, leaves and fibrous roots of Panax quinquefolium contained allelopathic substances. When the concentration of the allelopathic substances exceeded 1g per kg soil, P. quinquefolius could not grow. On the other hand, when the concentration of allelopathic substances fell below 0.2 g per kg soil, the rate of seedling growth was decreased by 25%. When P. quinquefolius was cultivated in the soil in which purple Perilla frutesens had previously grown, or in the soil supplemented with Fructus Perillae, the rates of seedling growth and the yield were raised by 26.8% and 11.5% tively, in comparison with the controls.", "Rotation of Panax quinquefolium and Perilla frutesens was shown to be a good way for the cultivation of the former.
