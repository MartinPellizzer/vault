A number of PCOS complications may be associated with the elevated level of angiotensin\u00a0II and low bradykinin concentrations. The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequencies of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms in women with PCOS and to determine the association between ACE genetic variants and the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications in such women. A total of 138\u00a0PCOS patients and 110\u00a0healthy volunteers were enrolled. Cardiovascular risk was estimated according to the criteria of the American Heart Association and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society. The median average age was 28.5 (26.0\u201131.0) and 27.0 (24.0\u201130.0) years in the control and PCOS groups, respectively (P=0.004). Anthropometric parameters, including body mass index and waist circumference were significantly higher in the PCOS patients. In the PCOS group, 97 (57.4%) of the subjects were metabolically unhealthy, whereas, in the control group 51 (46.4%) subjects were (P=0.07). The II, ID, and DD genotypes frequencies were 29.1, 44.5, and 26.4% in the controls and 5.0, 37.7, and 57.3% in the PCOS patients. The cardioprotective I\u00a0allele was observed significantly less frequently in the women with PCOS compared with the controls [odds ratio (OR), 3.27; P=0.0001]. The DD\u00a0genotype, which is known to increase cardiovascular risk, was more frequently observed in PCOS patients (OR, 3.87; P=0.0003), whereas the cardioprotective II\u00a0genotype occurred in this group less frequently (OR, 0.4; P=0.06). The results of the present study demonstrated a statistically significant association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and the presence and intensity of metabolic disturbances in women with PCOS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences, 60\u2011535 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "O\u017cegowska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, 61\u2011707 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bogacz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Phytochemistry, Institute of Natural Fibers and Medicinal Plants, 61\u2011707 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bartkowiak-Wieczorek", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Perinatology and Women's Diseases, Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences, 60\u2011535 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Infertility and Reproductive Endocrinology, Pozna\u0144 University of Medical Sciences, 60\u2011535 Pozna\u0144, Poland."}], "LastName": "Pawelczyk", "ForeName": "Leszek", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Greece", "MedlineTA": "Mol Med Rep", "NlmUniqueID": "101475259", "ISSNLinking": "1791-2997"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.15.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Alleles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Association Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Predisposition to Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "INDEL Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Odds Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "6", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27840997", "10.3892/mmr.2016.5910"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
