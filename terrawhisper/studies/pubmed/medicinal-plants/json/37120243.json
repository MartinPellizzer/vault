In this study, comprehensive research on physiological, cytological and transcriptional responses to different levels of heat stress were conducted on a typical phenotype of P. ternata. First, P. ternata exhibited tolerance to the increased temperature, which was supported by normal growing leaves, as well as decreased and sustained photosynthetic parameters. Severe stress aggravated the damages, and P. ternata displayed an obvious leaf senescence phenotype, with significantly increased SOD and POD activities (46% and 213%). In addition, mesophyll cells were seriously damaged, chloroplast thylakoid was fuzzy, grana lamellae and stroma lamellae were obviously broken, and grana thylakoids were stacked, resulting in a dramatically declined photosynthetic rate (74.6%). Moreover, a total of 16 808 genes were significantly differential expressed during this process, most of which were involved in photosynthesis, transmembrane transporter activity and plastid metabolism. The number of differentially expressed transcription factors in MYB and bHLH families was the largest, indicating that these genes might participate in heat stress response in P. ternata. These findings provide insight into the response to high temperature and facilitate the standardized cultivation of P. ternata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2012 China Pharmaceutical University.
