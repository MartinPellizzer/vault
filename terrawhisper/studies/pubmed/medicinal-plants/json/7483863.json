The spices tested included dried leaves of marjoram (Majorana hortensis Moench), rhizomes of ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) and powdered hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.). The study included the isolation and identification of micro-organisms in spices following their irradiation, as well as gas chromatographic (GLC) chemical analysis for the presence and structure of volatile oils, pungent and pigment materials. The results showed that hot pepper was contaminated more (9.2 x 10(5)/g) than marjoram (4.2 x 10(3)/g) and ginger (14.3 x 10(3)/g) with respect to total aerobic bacterial content. The total contents of moulds were 4.8 x 10(3)/g, 5.7 x 10(3)/g and 19 x 10(3)/g in the same spices, respectively, but the pathogenic moulds and bacterial strains differed according to the type of spice. Irradiation at 10, 20 and 30 kGy caused complete elimination of micro-organisms, whereas 5 kGy was less effective. With the GLC method chosen 18 and 50 compounds could be detected in the extracts of marjoram and ginger, respectively; gamma-terpinen and zingiberen being the major compounds in marjoram and ginger, respectively. A noticeable reduction was observed in the amount of terpenes present in irradiated marjoram; they were converted to monoterpenesalcohols. Ginger was more sensitive to irradiation, especially at high doses, but moderate changes were detected at low doses (5 and 10 kGy). A slight, but significant effect on the capsaicin (pungent compound) in hot-pepper was observed following irradiation, whereas no changes in total pigments resulted at any dose. These results prove that 10 kGy is a sufficiently high dose to eliminate the micro-organisms in spices, causing only slight changes in the flavouring materials."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Centre for Radiation Research and Technology, Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farag", "ForeName": "S E", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aziz", "ForeName": "N H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Attia", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Z Lebensm Unters Forsch", "NlmUniqueID": "7509812", "ISSNLinking": "0044-3026"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Irradiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Negative Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Gram-Positive Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7483863", "10.1007/BF01193005"]}}]}
