Besides tamsulosin at a dose of 0.4\u2009mg once daily, participants based on their allocation group received NAC or placebo at a dose of 600\u2009mg twice daily for 12\u2009weeks. The efficacy of the medications was assessed by measuring changes in the NIH-CPSI total score and its subscales, including pain, urinary symptoms, and quality of life.", "Based on the general linear model analysis of the data, over the 12-week treatment, NAC+tamsulosin was statistically superior to placebo+tamsulosin in reducing the total NIH-CPSI score, pain subscore, and quality-of-life subscore (P value <.001). Further, after 12\u2009weeks, more patients in the NAC+tamsulosin group than in the placebo+tamsulosin group met the responder criterion, defined as a decrease of at least 6 points in the NIH-CPSI total score (65.6% vs 29.0%). A more favorable outcome was also noted in the NAC+tamsulosin group regarding the number of patients reporting moderate or marked improvement in symptoms (62.5% vs 25.80%). No significant difference was seen between the groups concerning changes in urinary symptoms.", "Our study provided clinical evidence that men with category III CP might benefit from NAC treatment.
