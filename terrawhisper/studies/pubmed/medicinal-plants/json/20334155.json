Monoterpenoids, including oxygenated compounds and hydrocarbons, comprising 63.4 and 33.9%, respectively, were the principal compound groups of the essential oil. In total, 25 constituents accounting for 97.8% of the oil were identified. Perilla aldehyde (54.3%) and limonene (30.1%) were characterized as the main components. The essential oil of D. surmandinum and its two main constituents showed a marked antioxidant and radical scavenging activity using different model systems, including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and beta-carotene-linoleic acid blenching assays. The results of cytotoxicity activity using the MTT assay exhibited that the oil of D. surmandinum has a good effect against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and erythromyeloblastoid leukemia cell lines (K562) with IC50 values of 14 and 16 microg/mL, respectively. The cytotoxic potential of D. surmandinum oil against rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line (PC 12) was weak (IC50 of >100 microg/mL). Perilla aldehyde and limonene, the main constituents of D. surmandinum essential oil, inhibited all investigated cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner with IC50 values ranged from 0.25-5.0 mmol/L."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Medicinal Plants and Drugs Res.
