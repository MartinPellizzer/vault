The potential of A.\u00a0karroo as herbal medicine, its associated phytochemistry and biological activities are reviewed. The extensive literature survey revealed that A.\u00a0karroo is traditionally used to treat or manage 32 and five human and animal diseases and ailments, respectively. The species is used as herbal medicine for diseases and ailments such as colds, diarrhoea, dysentery, flu, malaria, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), wounds, and also as colic and ethnoveterinary medicine. Multiple classes of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenols, phytosterols, proanthocyanidin, tannin, terpenes as well as several minerals have been identified from leaves and roots of A.\u00a0karroo. Scientific studies on A.\u00a0karroo indicate that it has a wide range of pharmacological activities which include antibacterial, antifungal, antigonococcal, antihelmintic, antilisterial, antimalarial, antimycobacterial, antioxidant, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, anti-inflammatory and analgesic. A. karroo has a lot of potential as a possible source of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of a wide range of both human and animal diseases and ailments. Future research should focus on the mechanisms of action of the different plant parts used as herbal medicines, isolated compounds, their efficacy, toxicity and clinical relevance."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Hainan Medical University.
