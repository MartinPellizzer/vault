Survanta, ALEC and Exosurf, commonly used surfactants in therapy of respiratory distress syndrome were used as controls for comparison. The test surfactants, in Ringer's lactate at 1%, were pulsated at 40 cpm in the surfactometer. EO caused a significant improvement of adsorption of the surfactants. In the case of the binary mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (2:3), EO significantly improved the adsorption, stability and minimum surface tension obtained. This combination performed better than ALEC and Exosurf and was comparable to Survanta with respect to minimum surface tension attained. The re-spreading of a surface excess film of this mixture in a Wilhelmy balance was higher than that of ALEC and Exosurf. The ultrastructure of the EO enriched surfactants using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy showed easy facturability and formation of open membranous structures, which could have been associated with the improved surface activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, 3333 California Street, Suite 150, San Francisco, CA 94118-1245, USA. rban@itsc.ucsf.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banerjee", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bellare", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Respir Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0047142", "ISSNLinking": "0034-5687"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pulmonary Surfactants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surface Properties"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11348641", "10.1016/s0034-5687(01)00201-8", "S0034568701002018"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
