Its crystal structures have been determined in complex with porcine pancreatic trypsin in two crystal forms (an orthorhombic form at 1.75 A resolution and a tetragonal form at 1.9 A) and in the free state at 2.3 A resolution. They have been refined to crystallographic R-values of 18.9%, 21.6% and 19.8%, respectively. The three models of STI reported here represent a significant improvement over the partial inhibitor structure in the complex, which was previously determined at a nominal resolution of 2.6 A by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. This study provides the first high-resolution picture of the complex between a Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor with its cognate proteinase. Many of the external loops of STI show high B-factors, both in the free and the complexed states, except the reactive site loop whose B-factors are dramatically reduced upon complexation. The reactive site loop of STI adopts a canonical conformation similar to those in other substrate-like inhibitors. The P1 carbonyl group displays no out-of-plane displacement and thus retains a nominal trigonal planar geometry. Modeling studies on the complex between a homologous Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitor DE-3 from Erythrina caffra and the human tissue-type plasminogen activator reveal a new insight into the specific interactions which could play a crucial role in their binding."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Seoul National University, Korea."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suh", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985088R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-2836"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9088-41-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Kunitz Soybean"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.68", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crystallography, X-Ray"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Folding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Structure, Secondary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Proteinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Kunitz Soybean"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9466914", "10.1006/jmbi.1997.1469", "S0022-2836(97)91469-8"]}}]}
