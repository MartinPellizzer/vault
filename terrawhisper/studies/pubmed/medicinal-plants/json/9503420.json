Effects of dulcitol were examined on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in DBA/1J mice. From 6 weeks after the first immunization with bovine type II collagen, dulcitol (100 mg/kg body weight/day) was administered orally to immunized mice for 9 weeks. Clinical score of CIA was improved significantly by dulcitol intervention compared with the non-treated CIA mice. Radiographic score of phalangeal destruction was also improved by dulcitol treatment. These findings suggest that dulcitol may play a role in regulation of some inflammatory responses in the present arthritis model. Significant reduction of percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets in the spleen leucocytes of CIA mice was observed by flow cytometry. Almost normal level of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in dulcitol-treated groups, suggesting T cell-modifying effect of dulcitol in CIA. Weight of spleen was larger in CIA mice and it was not affected by dulcitol. Anti-collagen antibody titer was increased in CIA mice, and it was not affected by dulcitol, either. Improvement of the changes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen by dulcitol may suggest its modulatory effect on cellular immunity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "S H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kakizoe", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okunishi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J F", "Initials": "JF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "113ZQ1Y7DD", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-34-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Collagen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "CD4-CD8 Ratio"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Collagen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Galactitol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunity, Cellular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred DBA"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9503420", "10.1254/fpj.110.supplement_132"]}}]}
