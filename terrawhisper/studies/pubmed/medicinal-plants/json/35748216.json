Due to the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapies and radiotherapies, immunotherapy has emerged as a potent strategy to treat cancer. In cancer immunotherapy, cancer immune surveillance plays a crucial role in the cancer process, which contains various effector cells from innate and adaptive immunity. This review summarized the functions of innate and adaptive immune cells in cancer immunosurveillance and their main reported targets. Moreover, the potential targets about the modulatory effects of cancer immunosurveillance were predicted using network-based target analysis, with total predicted pathways not only reporting previously reported pathways, but also putative signaling pathways pending for investigation. In addition, the potential use of herbal medicines and their phytochemicals in the modulation of cancer immunosurveillance were also discussed. Taken together, this review paper aims to provide scientific insight into further drug development, particularly herbs, phytochemicals, and TCM formulae, in the modulatory effects of cancer immunosurveillance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Chinese Medicine Material, Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 136000, P.
