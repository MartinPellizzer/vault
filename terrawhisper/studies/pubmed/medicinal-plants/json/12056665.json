They were schematically presented. In early and middle spermiogenesis, i.e. during the period preceding formation of fibrillar structure of mature spermatozoid nucleus, a slight remodelling of chromatin, accompanied by proplastid transformation into an amyloplast as well as by development of 2 flagella and a microtubular manchette, is observed. First, condensed chromatin concentrates around the nuclear envelope (phases III-V) and then it transforms into a network-like structure (phase VI). This change in chromatin structure is preceded by nucleolar extrusion to the cytoplasm where nucleoli become degraded (phase IV) and by a dynamic development of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (phase V) which is continuous with the nuclear envelope and with RER of the adjacent spermatids via plasmodesmata. The inner membrane of the nuclear envelope invaginates into the nucleoplasm in which \"nuclear reticulum\" appears. It all happens during increased 3H-arginine and 3H-lysine incorporation into proteins which are rapidly translocated into the nucleus. In medium-late spermiogenesis (phases VI-VIII), network-like condensed chromatin disappears. Next, the structure of the nucleus changes dramatically. Short, randomly positioned fibrils (phase VII) appear and gradually become longer (phase VIII), thicker (phase IX) and more distinct, lying parallel to the surface of elongating and curling nucleus. Membranes of the nuclear envelope become closer to each other and a distinct dark layer--probably lamin--appears adhering to the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. Towards the end of spermiogenesis (phase X), very densely packed parallel helices, ca 2 nm in diameter, are visible. The surfaces of flagella and the spermatozoid are covered with diamond-shaped larger and smaller scales, respectively. Helically coiled spermatozoids are liberated from antheridial filament cells through earlier created (phase VIII) \"liberation pores\" with pads of unknown nature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cytophysiology, University of \u0142\u00f3d\u017a, Poland."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwiatkowska", "ForeName": "Maria", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pop\u0142o\u0144ska", "ForeName": "Katarzyna", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Folia Histochem Cytobiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8502651", "ISSNLinking": "0239-8508"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chromatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "94ZLA3W45F", "NameOfSubstance": "Arginine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K3Z4F929H6", "NameOfSubstance": "Lysine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arginine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Autoradiography"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lysine"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12056665"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
