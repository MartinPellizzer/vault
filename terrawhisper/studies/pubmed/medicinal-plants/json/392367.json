The collective consisted of 25 patients with primary neoplasms of the ovary who received post-operative treatment with Iscador. The average age was 50.96 years. 20 women were in the advanced stages III and IV according to FIGO. Five-year survival rates were 100% in stages I and II, 23% in stage III and 0% in stage IV. After establishing best possible congruence, our group of patients was compared with a collective of 22 women with neoplasms of the ovary who had received post-operative treatment with Cytoval. Inspite of less favorable prognostic indicators for the Iscador patients, the latter reached an average survival rate of 16.2 months as compared to 5.2 months in the group treated with Cytoval (ratio 3.1:1). The survival period of Iscador patients in stage III was 4.2 times longer, in stage IV 1.6 times longer than that of the Cytoval patients. The difference is statistically significant (alpha less than 0.018). A comparison of the results of the two collectives shows that Iscador a special preparation of viscum album, is a useful and effective treatment of carcinoma of the ovary, particularly since it usually does not cause serious and undesired side effects. Thus the original working hypothesis was confirmed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hassauer", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gutsch", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Burkhardt", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Welche Erfolgsaussichten bietet die Iscador-Therapie beim fortgeschrittenen Ovarialkarzinom?"}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Onkologie", "NlmUniqueID": "7808556", "ISSNLinking": "0378-584X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acrylates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Acrylates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasm Staging"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "mortality", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ovarian Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postoperative Care"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["392367", "10.1159/000214453"]}}]}
