First the history of the pharmacies which comes back to the XIIIth century and that of the pharmacists which were prosperous and often members of council of the free city. The first regulation concerning the selling of poisons dates back to 1400, the one of apothecaries of Strasbourg to about 1500. A detailed regulation was published by the City Council in 1675. A Collegium medicum was created. This regulation was hardly modified by the French administration which supervised that of the city from 1681 on. Several printed books, particularly those on the art of distillation or on medicinal plants are amongst the most well known of the beginning of the XVIth century. Some pharmaceutical preparations of which the celestial theriaca of Strasbourg had also contributed to the renown of Strasbourg pharmacists. Finally strategically reasons joint to the existence of a School of Medicine School founded in 1794, the First Consul, Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, to create the School of Pharmacy of Strasbourg. In spite of the appointment of teachers as early as 1803 the School had only a few students and no premises and was challenged by the local pharmacists where companions were trained who could become pharmacists according to the old system. Its only during the reign of king Louis-Philippe that the School developed rapidly."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dirheimer", "ForeName": "Guy", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bachoffner", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "La Cr\u00e9ation de l'Ecole de pharmacie de Strasbourg en 1803."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Rev Hist Pharm (Paris)", "NlmUniqueID": "0204315", "ISSNLinking": "0035-2349"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "France"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Schools, Pharmacy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14964272"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
