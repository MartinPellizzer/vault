The aim of the present study was to compare the quality-of-life parameters in subjects receiving multivitamins plus ginseng with those found in subjects receiving multivitamins alone. The study was comparative, randomized and double-blind, and it involved 625 patients of both sexes divided into two groups taking one capsule per day for 12 weeks. Group A received vitamins, minerals, trace elements and ginseng extract G115 (Pharmaton Capsules) while group B received vitamins, minerals and trace elements (multivitamin capsules) only. The resulting quality-of-life was assessed by a standardized 11-item questionnaire, validated by the Medical School of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Of the 625 patients recruited, 124 were excluded from the study due to lack of compliance with the treatment, so that 338 patients in group A and 163 patients in group B completed the study. By the end of the study, the 4th of the monthly assessments showed that both the group-A and the group-B treatments had induced a significant increase in the quality-of-life index, the change being 11.9 points for Pharmaton Capsules in group A which was significantly superior to the 6.4 average increase with the group-B capsules containing multivitamins alone. Group A showed significant improvement in every one of the 11 questionnaire items, whereas group B did not show significant improvement in any of these items. Significant increases in body weight and in diastolic blood pressure were recorded in the group B treated with the multivitamin alone. Adverse effects of the capsules were minimal in both groups. This study has demonstrated that Pharmaton Capsules were more effective than the multivitamin capsules alone in improving the quality-of-life in a population subjected to the stress of high physical and mental activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma (UNAM), Mexico."}], "LastName": "Caso Marasco", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vargas Ruiz", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salas Villagomez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bego\u00f1a Infante", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Drugs Exp Clin Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7802135", "ISSNLinking": "0378-6501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality of Life"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9034759"]}}]}
