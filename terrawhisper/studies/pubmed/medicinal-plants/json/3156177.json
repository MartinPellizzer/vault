Terminal bud, axillary bud bearing nodes, and adult leaves were prefixed by a soluble carbodiimide to obtain the coupling of ABA on cellular proteins and postfixed by a conventional mixture of aldehydes. They were then embedded in paraffin or in plastic. Numerous controls were carried out on sections and on a model system to test the validity of the technique. Based on the staining patterns observed along the plant, an apico-basal gradient of ABA was revealed. In the older buds, ABA was mainly concentrated in the quiescent meristematic cells of the apex. Phloem cells of the main axis and chloroplasts of the leaves were specifically labeled. No reaction product was visualized in the parenchyma cells or in the cambial zone. Water stress, which is known to increase ABA content, induced an increase of immunoreactivity within the same compartments. This physiological test validates the stain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sotta", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sossountzov", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maldiney", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sabbagh", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tachon", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miginiac", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Histochem Cytochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9815334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1554"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fixatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72S9A8J5GW", "NameOfSubstance": "Abscisic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fixatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoenzyme Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3156177", "10.1177/33.3.3156177"]}}]}
