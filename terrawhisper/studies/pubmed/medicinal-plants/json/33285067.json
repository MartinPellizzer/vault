During the search for novel botanical pesticides from natural sources, the seeds of <i>Sophora tonkinensis</i> were systematically investigated to obtain 11 new matrine-type alkaloids (<b>1</b>-<b>11</b>), including one novel matrine-type alkaloid featuring an unprecedented 5/6/6/6 tetracyclic skeleton (<b>1</b>), along with 16 known compounds (<b>12</b>-<b>27</b>). Their structures were elucidated by comprehensive spectroscopic data analysis (IR, UV, NMR, and HRESIMS), ECD calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) activity and insecticidal activities against <i>Aphis fabae</i> and <i>Tetranychus urticae</i> of the compounds were also respectively screened using the half-leaf method and spray method. Biological tests indicated that compounds <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>26</b> displayed significant anti-TMV biological activities compared with the positive control ningnanmycin. Compounds <b>7</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>26</b> presented moderate activities against <i>A. fabae</i> with LC<sub>50</sub> values of 38.29, 18.63, and 23.74 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, compounds <b>13</b> and <b>26</b> exhibited weak activities against <i>T. urticae</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key
