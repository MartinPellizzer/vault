The resin discs were exposed to simulated brushing, thermocycling, and immersion in Artemisia sieberi extract for 8 hours. The surface roughness of the discs was assessed at baseline and after immersion in Artemisia sieberi extract. Candida growth was quantified through colony-forming units (CFU/mL). Data was analyzed using SPSS v.22 (\u03b1\u2a7d 0.05).", "Irrespective of the material type, the post-immersion surface roughness was significantly higher compared to pre-immersion values (p< 0.05). Candida growth was significantly higher in conventional acrylic materials than digitally fabricated acrylics (p< 0.05). At \u00d7 3, Ra and CFU were found to be moderately positive and non-significantly correlated (R= 0.664, p= 0.149). At \u00d7 4, Ra and CFU were found to be weak positive and non-significantly correlated (R= 0.344, p= 0.503).", "Artemisia sieberi extracts had a notable impact on digitally fabricated denture acrylics, reducing candida albicans growth compared to conventional heat-cured acrylic.
