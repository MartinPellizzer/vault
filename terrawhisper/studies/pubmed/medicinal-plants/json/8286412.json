However, STI does not inhibit tPA. From the three-dimensional structure of ETI it was known that the N-terminus of the molecule forms a finger-like structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the N-terminal finger region is located in close proximity to the reactive site loop and the N-terminal residue (Val) is bound up in the finger region. In STI the N-terminal region is located in close proximity to the reactive site loop and is folded into a structure similar to that in ETI. It was hypothesized that the N-terminal region is stabilized as in ETI and that the N-terminal residue of STI (Asp), because of its hydrophilic nature, is not involved in the structured N-terminal finger region of this protein. This leaves Asp1 of STI free to form an ion pair with Lys60 of trypsin, when STI and trypsin interact. When amino acid sequences of trypsin and the C-terminus of tPA are aligned for optimum homology, it is seen that there are a number of insertion sequences in tPA that are thought to be accommodated in the form of protrusions. One of these can be seen to occur in the region that lies opposite the Lys60 region of trypsin. It is suggested in this work that the N-terminal Asp of STI and this protrusion of tPA sterically prevent the two proteins from approaching close enough for binding and inhibition to occur. A modified form of ETI was produced with an Asp residue N-terminal to Val to simulate the N-terminal region of STI. The active sites were titrated against trypsin and assayed against tPA. The results showed that the modified form of ETI had activity towards tPA similar to that of STI. This evidence indicates strongly that the N-terminal Asp of STI prevents its binding to and inhibiting tPA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cape Town, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Teixeira", "ForeName": "A V", "Initials": "AV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dowdle", "ForeName": "E B", "Initials": "EB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Botes", "ForeName": "D P", "Initials": "DP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Biochim Biophys Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0217513", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3002"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "trypsin inhibitor, Erythrina caffra"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9088-41-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Kunitz Soybean"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis, Site-Directed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Alignment"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitor, Kunitz Soybean"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8286412", "0167-4781(94)90120-1"]}}]}
