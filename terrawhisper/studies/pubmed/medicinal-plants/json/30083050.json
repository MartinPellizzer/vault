However, effective conservation could not be implemented because of the lack of genomic information and genetic markers. In this study, a de novo transcriptome of <i>H elliptica</i> was sequenced using the NGS Illumina, and 132\u2009695 unigenes with the length >200\u2009bp (base pairs) were obtained. Among them, a total of 32\u2009109 unigenes were scanned to develop simple sequence repeats (SSRs). Based on NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) nonredundant database (Nr), these SSR sequences were annotated and assigned into gene ontology categories. In addition, we designed 126 pairs of SSR primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification, of which 12 pairs were identified to be polymorphic among 40 individuals from 8 populations. We then used the 12 polymorphic SSRs to construct a UPGMA dendrogram of the 40 individuals. In addition, a significant correlation between the genetic relationship and the geographic distance was found, suggesting a phylogeographic structure in <i>H elliptica</i>. Moreover, 2 of these SSRs were also successfully amplified in a related species <i>Veratrilla baillonii</i>, suggesting their cross-species transferability. Generally, the SSR markers with high polymorphisms identified in this study provide valuable genetic resources and represent an initial step for exploring the genetic diversity and population histories of <i>H elliptica</i> and its related species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan for Biomass Energy and Biotechnology of Environment, Key Laboratory of Ecological Adaptive Evolution and Conservation on Animals-Plants in Southwest Mountain Ecosystem of University in Yunnan Province, School of Life Sciences Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, P.
