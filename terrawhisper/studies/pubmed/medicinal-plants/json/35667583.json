It is said to possess a wide range of pharmacological activity. In a previous study, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of its methanol root extract have been scientifically demonstrated. The growing use of medicinal plants by people from low-income countries and the plethora of adverse effects accompanying this increasing use has demonstrated the need for comprehensive toxicological evaluation of these plants which have shown therapeutic activity. However, in the capsule that is Nigeria, these studies are seldom done even though locals continue to patronize these plants for their health benefits.", "To establish the repeated dose toxicity profile of the methanol root extract of Eriosema psoraleoides (EPE) in rats and also to investigate a possible mechanism for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.", "Male Wistar rats were utilised for the test. All animals used for the test were healthy. The oral repeated dose study was carried out for 28 days with animals being given the following doses daily; 250, 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg orally. The Wistar rats were euthanized afterwards and blood samples were taken. The samples were subjected to serum biochemistry in tandem with haematological testing. After acute induction of inflammation with 1% carrageenan in normal saline, sera samples were obtained from the animals: serum cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 levels (COX 1 and COX 2) were assayed using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay kits. Data were analysed utilising the appropriate software and tests.", "Oral Repeated dose administration of EPE for 28 days didn't produce any lethality in any animal throughout the duration of the test. Repeated dose administration of EPE showed a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decrease in the serum levels of Alanine Aminotransferase as well as Aspartate Aminotransferase at 250 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg dose levels. Total protein and albumin were also significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) decreased. A statistically significant (p < 0.05) decrease in serum urea level was also observed compared to the normal saline group (1\u00a0ml/kg). Sodium levels also showed a decrease with a statistically significant level only in the group treated with the extract at a dose of 1000\u00a0mg/kg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Haematological parameters were not significantly affected by EPE. The extract demonstrated an ability to down-regulate serum concentration of both COX 1 and 2, though not to a statistically significant level.", "The results of this study suggest that prolonged use of EPE might potentially adversely affect vital organs in the body and EPE may potentially act through its downregulation of COX 1 and 2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
