The subjects were given the medications two hours before they were rotated in a chair making head movements until a symptom total short of vomiting was reached. Standardized N.A.S.A. techniques were used for speed of rotation and end-point of motion sickness.", "The three doses of ginger were all at the placebo level of efficacy. Amitriptyline, ethopropazine and trihexyphenidyl increased the tolerated head movements but the increase was not statistically significant. Significant levels of protection were produced by dimenhydrinate, promethazine, scopolamine and d-amphetamine. Protection was further increased by combination of these latter drugs with d-amphetamine. Efficacy was greatest as the dose was increased.", "The medication of choice in this study was scopolamine 0.6 mg with d-amphetamine 10 mg. This combination provided good protection with acceptable side effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport  71130."}], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "C D", "Initials": "CD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manno", "ForeName": "J E", "Initials": "JE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wood", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manno", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mims", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Clin Res Pr Drug Regul Aff", "NlmUniqueID": "8303261", "ISSNLinking": "0735-7915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiemetics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DL48G20X8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Scopolamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FF28EJQ494", "NameOfSubstance": "Promethazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JB937PER5C", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimenhydrinate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "TZ47U051FI", "NameOfSubstance": "Dextroamphetamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiemetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dextroamphetamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Dimenhydrinate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Motion Sickness"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Promethazine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rotation"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Scopolamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spices"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11538042", "10.3109/10601338809031990"]}}]}
