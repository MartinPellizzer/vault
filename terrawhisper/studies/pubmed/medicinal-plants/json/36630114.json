The purpose of this study was to prepare different zinc oxide (ZnO)-based nanoparticles (NPs) via <i>Mentha longifolia</i> extract based on gauze linen fibre and study its effects on wound healing.", "The textural properties, morphology, thermal stability, purity, spectroscopic and phase structure of nanoparticles were investigated. Subsequently, male Wistar rats were subjected to wounds in six different treatment groups: Group I: control; group II: ZnO/W prepared in water (W); group III: ZnO/M synthesised with <i>Mentha longifolia</i> (M) extract; group IV: ZnO/copper(II) oxide (CuO)/M nanocomposite synthesised with M extract; group IV: treated with ZnO/silver (Ag)/M nanocomposite; group V: treated with ZnO/Ag/M nanocomposite; and finally, group VI: treated with ZnO/CuO/Ag/M nanocomposite. In all groups, the wounds were treated for 21 days with prepared samples. Every seven days, after measuring the decreasing rate of the wound size, tissue samples from each group were taken for histopathological analysis. The prepared tissue sections were assessed by haematoxylin and eosin staining for the formation of the epidermis, dermis and muscular tissue, and Masson's Trichrome staining for the formation of collagen fibres.", "The results showed that the ZnO/CuO/Ag/M nanocomposite was a significantly more effective wound healing material in comparison with other samples (p<0.05).", "In this study, the integration of ZnO/CuO/Ag nanocomposites with secondary metabolites of <i>Mentha longifolia</i> gave rise to a superior combination, which could support different phases of wound healing via the regulation of cytokines and growth factors in the course of healing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Arvanagh", "ForeName": "Farid Mohammadi", "Initials": "FM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Masoumabad", "ForeName": "Abolfazl Bayrami", "Initials": "AB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yangjeh", "ForeName": "Aziz Habibi", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bayrami", "ForeName": "Mahdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardabil, Iran."}], "LastName": "Feizpoor", "ForeName": "Solmaz", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nourani", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Taheri", "ForeName": "Ramezan Ali", "Initials": "RA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Wound Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9417080", "ISSNLinking": "0969-0700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "SOI2LOH54Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V1XJQ704R4", "NameOfSubstance": "cupric oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanocomposites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Metal Nanoparticles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36630114", "10.12968/jowc.2023.32.1.44"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
