Various parameters including freezing time, ultrasonic time, ultrasonic temperature and liquid-solid ratio were optimized by a single-factor design and multiple response surface methodology. The amounts of extracted anthocyanin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were measured by UV and HPLC respectively. The maximum yield of anthocyanins was achieved by freezing the samples for 5.43\u00a0min in liquid nitrogen at the liquid-solid ratio of 24.07:1 mL/g, followed by ultrasonic thawing at 41.64\u00a0\u00b0C for 23.56\u00a0min. The yield and antioxidant effects of ABVS extracted using FUTE, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and freeze-thawing extraction (FTE) were compared in order to determine the overall efficacy of FUTE. In addition to the higher content, FUTE extracted ABVS showed greater ability to scavenge DPPH\u00b7, ABTS<sup>+</sup> and superoxide anions, and inhibit lipid peroxidation compared to the ABVS extracted by UAE or FTE. The reducing power of the FUTE-derived ABVS was intermediate between that of the UAE and FTE samples. Taken together, FUTE can rapidly and effectively extract ABVS and retain its antioxidant capacity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
