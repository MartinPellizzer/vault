Red ginseng was found to promote the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, inhibit the production but promote the decomposition of endothelin, which is known to constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure as well as accelerated the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is known to have an angio-tonic effect. Furthermore, Red ginseng was observed to increase the production of Interleukin 1 beta, which is known to play important roles in the homeostatic activities of the human body such as immunity and inflammation as well as increasing the production of tissue plasminogen activators, which suppress the formation of thrombin in the blood coagulation and fibrinolysis mechanisms. It is suggested that Red ginseng has the effect of accelerating endothelial cells proliferation and of promoting physiological activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kanagawa Rehabilitation Institute, Japan."}], "LastName": "Nakajima", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uchiyama", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yoshida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mizukawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Haruki", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endothelin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.68", "NameOfSubstance": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Plasminogen Activator"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Umbilical Veins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9862024", "10.1142/S0192415X98000403", "S0192415X98000403"]}}]}
