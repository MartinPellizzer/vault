Melanoma is an aggressive malignancy which is poor in prognosis. Despite of many years of researches, the treatment of melanoma is still a problem. Historically, plants have been main resources in traditional medicine and natural products are considered as important sources of antitumor drugs. Meanwhile, garlic for a long time has been used in man's food as a medicinal plant. In this study, the garlic extract was prepared and fractionated by ultra-filtration method with Amicon system. Garlic extract and its fractions including residue (R) 100, R50, R30, R10, R5, and filtrate (F) 5 were investigated for their cytotoxic activities on Sk-mel3 cell line of melanoma. The results show that garlic extract induced a significant cytotoxic activity on Sk-mel3 cell line. Among fractions R100 and R10 have more potential in cytotoxic activities against Sk-mel3 melanoma cells. In conclusion, garlic appears to be a good candidate as an antitumor agent against melanoma. To clarify the effective molecules and their mechanisms more studies should be applied on animal models and humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Science and Research, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, I.R.
