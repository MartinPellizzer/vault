The rapid and highly infectious virus quickly spread around the country and has become a global pandemic. Thousands of people have been infected, and have died. Scientists around the world are working on the vaccine; however, an effective cure is yet to be developed. <b>Aims:</b> Search to be made on some alternative antiviral components from the rich sources of traditional herbal medicine in India as well as in the PRC. Here we discuss them with references. <b>Methods:</b> The knowledge gained from the literature search of antiviral known herbal products or Ayurvedic medicines that used to be applied against any viral or bacterial infections in the past, may be considered for deployment against COVID-19, and may be rewarded. <b>Results:</b> Many medicinal compounds are extracted from plants and have led to drug discovery. Similarly, plant products and their analogues have been employed as an early line of defense against COVID-19. <b>Conclusion:</b> Research into ethnobotany, phytochemistry, plant physiology and ecology may be important in protecting the global population from current and future pandemics."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1199-8972"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "St. John's University, Queens, NY, USA."}], "LastName": "Guha", "ForeName": "Smita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8054-4574"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA."}], "LastName": "Chakraborty", "ForeName": "Ashok", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8306569", "ISSNLinking": "0260-1060"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pandemics"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "28"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33858237", "10.1177/02601060211009704"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
