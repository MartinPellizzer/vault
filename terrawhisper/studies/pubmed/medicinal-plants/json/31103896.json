Some plant extracts contain antimicrobial properties that can treat different pathogens. Most of the world's population relies on medicinal plants and natural products for their primary health care needs. Therefore, there is a growing interest in natural products, medicinal plants, and traditional medicine along with a desire to design and develop novel plant-based pharmaceuticals. These plant-based pharmaceuticals may address the concerns of reduced efficacy of synthetic antibiotics due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. In this regard, some plant extracts from black pepper (Piper nigrum) with antimicrobial properties, including piperine, have the potential to be used as natural dietary supplements together with modern therapeutic approaches. This review highlights possible applications of piperine as the active compound in the fields of rational drug design and discovery, pharmaceutical chemistry, and biomedicine. We discuss different extraction methods and pharmacological effects of the analyzed substance to pave the way for further research strategies and perspectives towards the development of novel herbal products for better healthcare solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019.
