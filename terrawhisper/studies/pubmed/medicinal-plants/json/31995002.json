ER once activated by estrogen, it binds to DNA via translocating into the nucleus and regulates the activity of various genes. Withaferin A (WA) - an active compound of a medicinal plant Withania somnifera was reported to be a very effective anti-cancer agent and some of the recent studies has demonstrated that WA is capable of arresting the development of breast cancer via targeting estrogen receptor.", "The present study is aimed at understanding the molecular level interactions of ER and Tamoxifen in comparison to Withaferin A using In-silico approaches with emphasis on Withaferin A binding capability with ER in presence of point mutations which are causing de novo drug resistance to existing drugs like Tamoxifen.", "Molecular modeling and docking studies were performed for the Tamoxifen and Withaferin A with the Estrogen receptor. Molecular docking simulations of estrogen receptor in complex with Tamoxifen and Withaferin A were also performed.", "Amino acid residues, Glu353, Arg394 and Leu387 was observed as crucial for binding and stabilizing the protein-ligand complex in case of Tamoxifen and Withaferin-A. The potential of Withaferin A to overcome the drug resistance caused by the mutations in estrogen receptor to the existing drugs such as Tamoxifen was demonstrated.", "In-silico analysis has elucidated the binding mode and molecular level interactions which are expected to be of great help in further optimizing Withaferin A or design / discovery of future breast cancer inhibitors targeting estrogen receptor."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "Mohammad A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Farah", "ForeName": "Mohammad Abul", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Anazi", "ForeName": "Khalid M", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Innovative Informatica Technologies, HIG, HUDA, Mayuri Nagar, Miyapur, Hyderabad, 500 049, India."}], "LastName": "Basha", "ForeName": "Syed H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005, United States."}], "LastName": "Bai", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Environment and Forest Resources, Chungnam National University, Daehak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Joongku", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Al-Hemaid", "ForeName": "Fahad M A", "Initials": "FMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Mahmoud", "ForeName": "Ahmed H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University, Riyadh- 11451, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Hailan", "ForeName": "Waleed A Q", "Initials": "WAQ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Curr Pharm Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "100960530", "ISSNLinking": "1389-2010"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Estrogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Withanolides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L6DO3QW4K5", "NameOfSubstance": "withaferin A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Point Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Estrogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Withania"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Withanolides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31995002", "10.2174/1389201021666200129121843", "CPB-EPUB-104035"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
