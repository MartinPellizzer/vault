The antifungal activity was evaluated by Broth Microdilution Method. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFCs) of the essential oils were compared with Amphotricin B and Captan as standard drug. MIC values for all essential oils were between 1 to 8 mg/mL. MIC value of Fennel essential oil was comparable to MFC value obtained from fungicide Captan. Peppermint essential oil exhibited maximum inhibitory and fungicide activity in concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml against Alternaria sp. The essential oil was more effective than Fennel against Bipolaris, but MFC values of both essential oils were 4 mg/ml. C. cyminum displayed less susceptibility against all of the fungi. Regarding our finding, peppermint and Fennel oil seem to be a promising solution to control plant diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Researcher at AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mafakheri", "ForeName": "Hamzeh", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Persian Medicine, School of Medicine, AJA University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirghazanfari", "ForeName": "Sayid Mahdi", "Initials": "SM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7XU7A7DROE", "NameOfSubstance": "Amphotericin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EOL5G26Q9F", "NameOfSubstance": "Captan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amphotericin B"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Captan"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30672431"]}}]}
