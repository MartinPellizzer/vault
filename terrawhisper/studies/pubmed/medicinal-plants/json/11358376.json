For K-Cl cotransport induced by 500 mM urea, 0.3 mg/ml EGCg (epigallocatechin gallate; a major component in GTE) almost completely inhibited dehydration, and 6 mg/ml AGE inhibited dehydration to 30% of the control level. Both vitamins E and C had no effect at the level of 2 mM. Different tea extracts had different degrees of inhibition, but the inhibitory activity increased when the number of hydroxyl groups in the compounds increased. With storage of sickle cells at 4 degrees C for 6 days, the cells started to undergo spontaneous dehydration when incubated at 37 degrees C. Neither inhibitors for Ca-induced K efflux nor K-Cl cotransport could inhibit cell dehydration of stored sickle cells, but both GTE and AGE effectively inhibited it. Chloride efflux measurements using a chloride electrode demonstrated that both GTE and AGE inhibited anion transport in red blood cells. The inhibitory mechanism of these compounds may be related to anion transport inhibition, although involvement of their antioxidant activities can not yet be ruled out."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2001 Academic Press."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Philadelphia Biomedical Research Institute, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406, USA. stohnishi@aol.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "S T", "Initials": "ST"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohnishi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ogunmola", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Blood Cells Mol Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9509932", "ISSNLinking": "1079-9796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Symporters"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["complications", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Anemia, Sickle Cell"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Beverages"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Carrier Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Dehydration"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Aging"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Symporters"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "K Cl- Cotransporters"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11358376", "10.1006/bcmd.2000.0368", "S1079-9796(00)90368-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
