Macleaya cordata is a medicinal plant species from the Papaveraceae family, providing a safe resource for the manufacture of antimicrobial feed additive for livestock. The active constituents from M.\u00a0cordata are known to include benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs)\u00a0such as sanguinarine (SAN) and chelerythrine (CHE), but their metabolic pathways have yet to be studied in this non-model plant. The active biosynthesis of SAN and CHE in M.\u00a0cordata was first examined and confirmed by feeding <sup>13</sup>C-labeled tyrosine. To gain further insights, we de novo sequenced the whole genome of M. cordata, the first to be sequenced from the Papaveraceae family. The M.\u00a0cordata genome covering 378 Mb encodes 22,328 predicted protein-coding genes with 43.5% being transposable elements. As a member of basal eudicot, M.\u00a0cordata genome lacks\u00a0the paleohexaploidy event that occurred in almost all eudicots. From the genomics data, a complete set of 16\u00a0metabolic\u00a0genes for SAN and CHE biosynthesis was retrieved, and 14 of their biochemical activities were validated. These genomics and metabolic data show the conserved BIA metabolic pathways in M.\u00a0cordata and provide the knowledge foundation for future productions of SAN and CHE by crop improvement or microbial pathway reconstruction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 The Author.
