(SCP-GM) is mediated by a signal transduction system that involves calcium and possibly protein kinase(s). In this work, a number of exogenous agents were employed to further investigate the components of the signal transduction pathway involved in the induction of alkaloid biosynthesis by a fungal elicitor and abscisic acid (ABA). SCP-GM suspension-cells were treated with compounds that modify protein kinase activity, including phorbol esters, and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycerol (OAG), a synthetic diacylglycerol analogue. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate induced alkaloid accumulation by as much as 65-fold over control values, while the negative control, phorbol-13-monoacetate, had no effect. OAG also increased alkaloid production by approximately 25-fold as compared to controls. Likewise, pretreatment of the suspension-cell cultures with H-7 or staurosporine, significantly suppressed ABA- or fungal-induction of benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis. Modulators of GTP-binding protein activity were also active in this system. Treatment of the suspension-cells with cholera toxin (CHX) induced alkaloid accumulation by 25-fold, which increased to 34-fold when CHX was combined with a fungal elicitor derived from Penicillium expansum (PE), and 32-fold when CHX was combined with ABA. Treatment of SCP-GM cells with CHX also enhanced the activities of two N-methyltransferases in the benzophenanthridine biosynthetic pathway namely, tetrahydroberberine-N-methyltransferase and tetrahydrocoptisine-N-methyltransferase, by six and seven fold, respectively. Furthermore, benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis was induced by treating the suspension-cells with the G-protein activators, mastoparan, mas-7 or melittin, while the inactive homologue, mas-17, did not. Suppression of alkaloid accumulation occurred when the suspension-cells were treated with GDP beta S or pertussis toxin prior to treatment of the SCP-GM cells with either PE or ABA. The results support the hypothesis that one or more protein kinases, and putative G proteins are involved in the signal transduction pathway that mediates ABA and fungal-induced benzophenanthridine alkaloid biosynthesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago 60605, USA."}], "LastName": "Mahady", "ForeName": "G B", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beecher", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochemistry", "NlmUniqueID": "0151434", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9422"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "72S9A8J5GW", "NameOfSubstance": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "GTP-Binding Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H88EPA0A3N", "NameOfSubstance": "Staurosporine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abscisic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "GTP-Binding Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Staurosporine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "11"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "11", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9621455", "10.1016/s0031-9422(97)00823-6", "S0031942297008236"]}}]}
