Its twigs are used as chewing\u00a0sticks (toothbrushes), and it is believed that if a person uses it daily, it will make their gum healthy and strong. No study has ever been conducted to evaluate the antibacterial effect of <i>M. longifolia</i> extracts against oral microorganisms. Materials and methods Fresh stem\u00a0twigs (Madkam Kaarkad) of <i>M. longifolia</i> were collected and dried. The dried stem was cut into small pieces, 5 g of which was mixed with 50 ml distilled water (in the ratio 1:10) and kept for two days for maceration. After two days, the liquid was filtered and the final filtrate was obtained, from which dry pellets were made and stored in the refrigerator at 4\u00b0C.\u00a0Brain heart infusion agar was used as a medium to grow the lyophilized bacteria.\u00a0Pure strains of <i>Streptococcus mutans</i> 890 were obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and MTCC-suggested protocol was followed for the revival of lyophilized bacteria. The agar well diffusion method was used to determine the zone of inhibition. The extract of stems with different concentrations (10%, 7.5%, 5.0%, and 2.5%) and at different volumes (100 \u00b5l, 150 \u00b5l, 200 \u00b5l, and 250 \u00b5l) was transferred to the agar plates. Chlorhexidine 0.2% was used as a control and it was also transferred to agar plates, which were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. Antibacterial activity was interpreted from the size of the diameter of zones of inhibition measured in millimeters using a measuring scale in all the agar plates. Results The minimum zone of inhibition of 11 mm at 2.5% concentration and 100 \u00b5l volume of <i>M. longifolia</i> extract and the maximum zone of inhibition of 20 mm at 10% concentration and 250 \u00b5l volume was notified. While for chlorhexidine at 0.2% concentration, the zone of inhibition obtained was 9.5 mm at 40 \u00b5l volume. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of\u00a0<i>M. longifolia\u00a0</i>was found to be 35 mg/ml. Conclusion <i>M. longifolia</i> showed marked antibacterial activity against <i>S. mutans</i> and has a\u00a0high MIC value. Therefore, this plant can be considered\u00a0an effective agent against oral diseases like dental caries."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Fatma et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Hazaribag College of Dental Sciences and Hospital, Hazaribagh, IND."}], "LastName": "Fatma", "ForeName": "Areej", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Government Dental College and Hospital, Jamnagar, IND."}], "LastName": "Ahuja", "ForeName": "Vipin", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Periodontics and Implant Dentistry, Hazaribag College of Dental Sciences and Hospital, Hazaribagh, IND."}], "LastName": "Ahuja", "ForeName": "Annapurna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Department of Biotechnology, Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh, IND."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Satish", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Department of Biotechnology, Vinoba Bhave University, Hazaribagh, IND."}], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "Sunit K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pediatric and Preventive Dentistry, Sharad Pawar Dental College and Hospital, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND."}], "LastName": "Thosar", "ForeName": "Nilima R", "Initials": "NR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cureus", "NlmUniqueID": "101596737", "ISSNLinking": "2168-8184"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Antibiotic resistance in bacteria - an emerging public health problem.
