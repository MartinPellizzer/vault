In contrast to the better characterization of the photorespiratory pathway at a molecular level, the molecular regulation and significance of the plastidic pathway are not yet well understood. An Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA encoding 3-phosphoserine phosphatase, the enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of 3-phosphoserine to Ser in the final step of the plastidic pathway of Ser biosynthesis, was cloned by functional complementation of an Escherichia coli serB- mutant. The 1.1-kilobase pair full-length cDNA, encoding 295 amino acids in its open reading frame, contains a putative organelle targeting presequence. Chloroplastic targeting has been demonstrated by particle gun bombardment using an N-terminal 60-amino acid green fluorescence protein fusion protein. Southern hybridization suggested the existence of a single-copy gene that mapped to chromosome 1. 3-Phosphoserine phosphatase enzyme activity was detected in vitro in the overexpressed protein in E. coli. Northern analysis revealed preferential gene expression in leaf and root tissues of light-grown plants with an approximately 1.5-fold abundance in the root compared with the leaf tissues. This indicates the possible role of the plastidic pathway in supplying Ser to non-photosynthetic tissues, in contrast to the function of the photorespiratory pathway in photosynthetic tissues. This work completes the molecular cloning and characterization of the three genes involved in the plastidic pathway of Ser biosynthesis in higher plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Research Center of Medicinal Resources, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Inage-ku, Yayoi-cho 1-33, Chiba 263-8522, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ho", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Noji", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AB018408", "AB018409"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "452VLY9402", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.3", "NameOfSubstance": "phosphoserine phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plastids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Serine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "4", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10196182", "10.1074/jbc.274.16.11007", "S0021-9258(19)73601-1"]}}]}
