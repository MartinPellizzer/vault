However, hyperthermia can be prescribed for relief of pain or enhancing cancer cell death. Some studies have attempted its use as an adjuvant to improve therapeutic efficiency. Suberosin is a cumarin- derived natural agent that has shown anti-inflammatory properties.", "In this in vitro study, possible sensitization effect of suberosin in combination with radiation or hyperthermia was evaluated.", "MCF-7 breast cancer cells were irradiated or received hyperthermia with or without treatment with suberosin. The incidence of apoptosis as well as viability of MCF-7 cells were observed. Furthermore, the expressions of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax, Bcl-2, and some caspases were evaluated using real-time PCR.", "Both radiotherapy or hyperthermia reduced the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Suberosin amplified the effects of radiotherapy or hyperthermia for induction of pro-apoptotic genes and reducing cell viability.", "Suberosin has a potent anti-cancer effect when combined with radiotherapy or hyperthermia. It could be a potential candidate for killing breast cancer cells as well as increasing the therapeutic efficiency of radiotherapy or hyperthermia."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nodooshan", "ForeName": "Saeedeh Jafari", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Paramedical Science, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amini", "ForeName": "Peyman", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Orta Mahalle, \u00dcniversite Caddesi No. 27, Orhanl\u0131, Tuzla 34956, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ashrafizadeh", "ForeName": "Milad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Institute of Medicinal Plants, ACECR, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Tavakoli", "ForeName": "Saeed", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aryafar", "ForeName": "Tayebeh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Omid Tehran Radiation Oncology Center, Physics Section, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khalafi", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Musa", "ForeName": "Ahmed Eleojo", "Initials": "AE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Physics Department, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mahdavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Rabie", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Technology Research Center, Institute of Health Technology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Masoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadi", "ForeName": "Akbar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departments of Medical Physics and Radiology, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Kashan University of Medical Sciences, Kashan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farhood", "ForeName": "Bagher", "Initials": "B"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "98226", "Agency": "Kashan University of Medical Sciences", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Res Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101735701", "ISSNLinking": "2589-9775"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "suberosin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hyperthermia, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33371865", "10.2174/2589977512666201228104528", "CDRR-EPUB-112705"]}}]}
