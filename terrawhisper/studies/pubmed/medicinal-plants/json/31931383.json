The measurements of 2 phenylpropanoid glycosides (verbascoside and isoverbascoside) and 23 phenolic acids were performed in methanolic extracts from the biomass collected after 2-, 3- and 4-week growth cycles using the HPLC-DAD method. The presence of verbascoside, isoverbascoside and additionaly 7 phenolic acids (protocatechuic, chlorogenic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic, o-coumaric and m-coumaric acids) was confirmed in all extracts. Blue and red/blue lights stimulated the accumulation of verbascoside (max. of 6716 and 6023\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW after a 4-week growth cycle) and isoverbascoside (max. 333 and 379\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW also after 4\u00a0weeks). The maximum amounts of verbascoside and isoverbascoside were respectively 1.8- and 7.0-fold higher than under the control conditions. Phenolic acids were accumulated in different amounts, and the maximum total amounts ranged from 36 to 65\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW. LED lights also stimulated their accumulation in comparison with darkness and control. The main phenolic acids included: m-coumaric acid (max. 39\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW), ferulic acid (max. 12\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW), and protocatechuic acid (max. 13\u00a0mg 100\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> DW). Additionally, the quantities of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids) were estimated in acetonic extracts using spectrophotometry. Red/blue light stimulated the biosynthesis of pigments (max. total content 287\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> FW after 4-week growth cycles). This is the first study describing the effect of LED lights on the production of phenylpropanoid glycosides and phenolic acids in V. officinalis callus cultures. Very high amounts of verbascoside and isoverbascoside are interesting from a practical point of view."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
