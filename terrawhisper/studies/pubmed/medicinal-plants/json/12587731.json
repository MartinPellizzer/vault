Swiss albino mice were fed orally with different doses (10,15, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) of ethanolic extract for 7 days and on the 7th day, two doses each of anticancer drugs cyclophosphamide (CP; 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight) and mitomycin-C (MMC; 4 and 8 mg/kg body weight) were injected, ip, to different groups of animals. Bone marrow MN preparations were made at 24 and 48 hr time intervals. Coleus extract reduced CP and MMC induced MN and lower doses of the extract were found to be more effective than higher doses. The effective doses of extract in MN test were selected to study the anticlastogenic effects against CP (25 and 50 mg/kg body weight) and MMC (2 and 4 mg/kg body weight) induced chromosomal aberrations. The results indicate the protective effect of C. aromaticus against CP and MMC induced cytogenetic damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Zoology, Mangalore University, Mangalagangothri 574 199, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Shyama", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naik", "ForeName": "Prashantha", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vijayalaxmi", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "50SG953SK6", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8N3DW7272P", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclophosphamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclophosphamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mitomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "18", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12587731"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
