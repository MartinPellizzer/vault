Three chromatographic analytical methods (ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection and gas chromatography with mass spectrometric and flame ionization detection) were evaluated regarding selectivity, sensitivity, analytical accuracy, and precision. The performance of the methods was compared and all three methods were demonstrated to be appropriate tools for analyzing phytocannabinoids in cannabis. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection showed slightly better accuracy in determining phytocannabinoid acids, which are often difficult to quantify owing to their limited stability. Aspects of sample preparation, such as material homogenization and extraction, were also considered. A single ultrasonic-assisted ethanolic extraction of dried and powdered plant samples of cannabis was shown to be exhaustive for extracting the samples prior to analysis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5845-6903"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Phytochemistry, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic. tibor.beres@upol.cz."}], "LastName": "B\u00e9res", "ForeName": "Tibor", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Phytochemistry, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "\u010cernochov\u00e1", "ForeName": "Lucie", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Phytochemistry, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 29, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "\u0106avar Zeljkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Sanja", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 29, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Benick\u00e1", "ForeName": "Sandra", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Growth Regulators, The Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Experimental Botany & Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Guck\u00fd", "ForeName": "Tom\u00e1\u0161", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 29, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Ber\u010d\u00e1k", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Phytochemistry, Palack\u00fd University, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 27, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, \u0160lechtitel\u016f 29, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Tarkowski", "ForeName": "Petr", "Initials": "P"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "RO0419", "Agency": "Ministerstvo Zem\u011bd\u011blstv\u00ed", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Anal Bioanal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101134327", "ISSNLinking": "1618-2642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabis"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Flame Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["organization & administration"], "DescriptorName": "Laboratories"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Limit of Detection"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30895348", "10.1007/s00216-019-01760-y", "10.1007/s00216-019-01760-y"]}}]}
