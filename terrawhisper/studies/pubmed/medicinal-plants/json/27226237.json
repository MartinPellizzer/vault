Cytotoxicity of the aroeira's methanol extract was evaluated in lineage of fibroblasts. Adherent cells were treated with different concentrations of aroeira's methanol extract in the medium: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Control cells were cultivated in the medium only. Analyses were done at 24, 48, 72 and 96\u2009h of culture by neutral red assay; and at 24, 48 and 96\u2009h by crystal violet assay.", "FIA-ESI-IT-MS analysis determined the presence of compounds, for the first time in the species: quercetin-O-glucuronide and quercetin-O-deoxyhexose-O-glucose in the extract. On one hand, neutral red and crystal violet assay showed a reduction (to 50% up until 100%) of cellular viability of groups of 100 and 1000\u2009\u03bcg/mL compared with control at 96\u2009h (p\u2009<\u20090.05). On the other hand, lower concentrations (0.1; 1 and 10\u2009\u03bcg/mL) of the extract were similar to that of the control at 96\u2009h (p\u2009<\u20090.05), in general.", "In view of the results, we can conclude that the extract of aroeira presents tannins and flavonoids. Furthermore, the extract is capable of modulating the viability of human gingival fibroblasts according to its concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences , Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Machado", "ForeName": "Alessandra Cury", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biologic Science , School of Science, UNESP , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Souza", "ForeName": "Leonardo Perez", "Initials": "LP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biologic Science , School of Science, UNESP , Bauru , Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany , Bioscience Institute, UNESP , Botucatu , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Saldanha", "ForeName": "Luiz Leonardo", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biologic Science , School of Science, UNESP , Bauru , Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Botany , Bioscience Institute, UNESP , Botucatu , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pieroni", "ForeName": "La\u00eds Goyos", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences , Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Matos", "ForeName": "Adriana Arruda", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences , Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Fl\u00e1via Amadeu de", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Laboratory of Conservation and Biodiversity, Biosciences Institute , Campus Paulista Coast - Unity S\u00e3o Vicente, UNESP , S\u00e3o Vicente , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Vilegas", "ForeName": "Wagner", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Prosthodontics , Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo , Bauru , SP , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Damante", "ForeName": "Carla Andreotti", "Initials": "CA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Biologic Science , School of Science, UNESP , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Dokkedal", "ForeName": "Anne L\u00edgia", "Initials": "AL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Biological Sciences , Bauru School of Dentistry, University of S\u00e3o Paulo , Bauru , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Rodrigo Cardoso de", "Initials": "RC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anacardiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fibroblasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27226237", "10.1080/13880209.2016.1182555"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
