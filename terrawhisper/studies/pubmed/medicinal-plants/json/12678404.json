We examined the acquired micronucleus formation in unirradiated and irradiated samples of cultured blood lymphocytes using the cytochalasin block micronucleus test (CBMN). Centromere-positive micronuclei were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a DNA probe labeled with alpha-satellite digogsigenin. Equiseti herba had weak clastogenic properties, increasing the yield of micronuclei in unirradiated samples and reducing the level of radiation-induced micronuclei in a concentration-dependent manner. In the control, unirradiated samples, 36.8% of micronuclei were centromere-positive (MNC+), while in the irradiated ones the percentage of MNC+ ranged from 10.8-15.3%, indicating a clastogenic mechanism for the micronuclei formation. Ononidis radix was a strong clastogen and radiosensitizer, rapidly increasing the yield of micronuclei in unirradiated samples up to 5-fold and potentiating the yield of radiation-induced micronuclei up to 1.7-fold. In cultures treated with Ononidis radix, the percentage of MNC+ micronuclei ranged from 18.8 to 23.8%, indicating that micronuclei originated by a clastogenic mechanism. Uvae ursi did not affect the yield of micronuclei either in unirradiated or in irradiated samples. The micronucleus formation assay is a reliable screen for plant extracts and purified compounds, for the identification of compounds that might either inhibit clastogenesis or potentiate radiotherapy for malignancy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Molecular Biology and Endocrinology, Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Belgrade, Yugoslavia. gjoksic@rt270.vin.bg.ac.yu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Joksi\u0107", "ForeName": "Gordana", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Stankovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Miroslava", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Novak", "ForeName": "Angelina", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Arctostaphylos"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Micronucleus Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12678404", "10.1615/jenvpathtoxoncol.v22.i1.40"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
