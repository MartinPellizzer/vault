However, the chemical quality evaluation of C. radix in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 Version) is still lacking; therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method to evaluate its quality accurately and systematically. Herein, a reliable method for a comprehensive chemical analysis of bioactive compounds in C. radix by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector was developed based on the quality marker (Q-marker) concept, which can efficiently reflect its immune activity. Our previous research explored the seven potential bioactive compounds reflecting the immune regulation activities of C. radix by spectrum-effect relationship analysis. Therefore, in this study, we researched on establishing a quality control method and selected the modern pharmacodynamic experiment of immune regulation to verify the potential bioactive compounds as quality markers. A real quality control method that reflected the traditional efficacy of C. radix in strengthening the spleen and tonifying lungs was developed. Furthermore, the C. radix extract and the seven bioactive compounds could promote the proliferation of immune-related cells and regulate the secretion of inflammatory factors, thus playing a role in immune regulation."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2678-6155"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Ministry of Education, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, P.
