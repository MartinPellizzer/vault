The characterization of their ion channels has been achieved using mainly the whole-cell patch-clamp technique applied to guard-cell protoplasts. The aim of this study was to obtain recordings of ion channel currents in intact guard cells and especially of slow anion channels of Arabidopsis thaliana, a species of fundamental genetic interest. Application of the discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp technique enabled the first characterization of K+ currents in Commelina communis and of slow anion currents in C. communis and A. thaliana in intact guard cells to be made. Inward K+ channels from A. thaliana were inhibited by external application of tetraethylammonium (TEA) or Ca2+. In the presence of K+ channel blockers, slow anion channel currents were elicited in almost all guard cells tested and were confirmed by the application of anion channel blockers. In A. thaliana, only anthracene-9 carboxylic acid was able to inhibit slow anion currents, to promote stomatal opening in the dark and to reverse the effect of 25 microM abscisic acid under light. Use of a single microelectrode and preservation of cell integrity make this technique well suited for the study of ion channel regulation in species that have guard cell protoplasts with which it is difficult to form good seals."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CEA Cadarache, DSV-DEVM, Laboratoire de Bio\u00e9nerg\u00e9tique Cellulaire, BP1, F-13108, St Paul-lez-Durance, Cedex France. cforestier@cea.fr"}], "LastName": "Forestier", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bouteau", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Leonhardt", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Vavasseur", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pflugers Arch", "NlmUniqueID": "0154720", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6768"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anions"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ion Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Channels"}, {"RegistryNumber": "660YQ98I10", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium Chloride"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M4I0D6VV5M", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anions"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electric Conductivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Channels"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microelectrodes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patch-Clamp Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Channels"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium Chloride"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9799408", "10.1007/s004240050724", "10.1007/s004240050724"]}}]}
