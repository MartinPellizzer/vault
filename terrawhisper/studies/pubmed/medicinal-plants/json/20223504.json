ABS is a mixture of 5 plants that has historically been used in Turkish traditional medicine. It has been approved by the Ministry of Health to manage external hemorrhage and dental surgery bleeding in Turkey.", "Twenty-two Wistar albino rats underwent partial nephrectomy after intravenous heparin anticoagulation (2000 U/kg). The cut surface received 1 of 3 therapies, namely no treatment, Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) or ABS (Trend Teknoloji Ia\u00e7 AS, Istanbul, Turkey). Blood pressure was continually monitored. Survival time, total blood loss, and mean arterial pressure were recorded for 60 minute or until death. Rats that were alive (mean arterial pressure>or=20 mm Hg) at the end of 60 minutes were sacrificed with blood withdrawal with the help of catheters.", "All animals that received no treatment died within 60 minutes of follow-up. One of 7 in the Surgicel group, and 5 of 7 animals in the ABS group, survived. Mean survival times for the Surgicel and ABS groups were 42.7 and 53.4 minutes, respectively. Rats in the ABS and Surgicel groups survived significantly longer than rats in the control group (P<.05). There were no significant differences between the ABS and the Surgicel groups in survival (P=.128).", "ABS is as effective as Surgicel in achieving hemostasis and lengthening survival time following partial nephrectomy in an experimental rat model."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
