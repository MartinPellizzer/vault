Therefore, we investigated the impact of foliar exposure to MWCNTs on the oxidative stress responses in the Salvia verticillata as a medicinal plant. Furthermore, we evaluated the possible correlations between gene expression and activity of the key enzymes in the phenolic acids biosynthesis pathways and their accumulation in the treated leaves. The leaves of two-month-old plants were sprayed with different concentrations (0-1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) of MWCNTs. Raman's data and Transmission Electron Microscopy images have confirmed the absorption of MWCNTs via epidermal cells layer into the parenchymal cells of the exposed leaves. The results showed that exposure to MWCNTs led to a decrease in the photosynthetic pigments and increases in the oxidative stress indices (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants) in the leaves with a dose-dependent manner. The content of rosmarinic acid as a main phenolic acid was increased in the MWCNTs-exposed leaves to 50 and 1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, nearly four times relative to the control. Unlike with other examined enzymes, a positive correlation was deduced between the activity and gene expression patterns of the rosmarinic acid synthase with the rosmarinic acid accumulation in the treatments. Overall, MWCNTs at the low concentrations could promote the production of the pharmaceutical metabolites by the changes in the ROS generation. However, at the higher concentrations, MWCNTs were toxic and induced the oxidative damages in S. verticillata."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
