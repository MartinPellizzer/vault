Study on photoredox and photoimmunology of borage is little. Natural immunomodulatory plants with minimal adverse/toxic effects could help boost animal health and, ultimately, public health. To determine the effect of borage on the functions of key circulating innate immune cells, effects of borage extract (BE) on bovine neutrophils (PMN) photoredox and phagocytosis events were evaluated using an in vitro model system. Blood PMN isolated from healthy high yielding dairy cows (n = 8/treatment) were pre-incubated with BE and the impact on phagocytosis-dependent-and-independent cellular chemiluminescence (CL), phagocytosis, killing of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), fluorescence-based PMN H2O2 production and necrosis were assessed. Relative to control (no BE) PMN, treatment with BE significantly increased phagocytosis-dependent-and-independent PMN CL (>10-15% increase). While BE also led to increased PMN H2O2 production, necrosis was also surprisingly higher in these cells. Phagocytosis and killing of both E. coli and S. aureus by PMN treated with BE was substantially higher than that by control PMN. The increased photoimmunobiological events especially intracellular CL, intracellular H2O2 formation, and phagocytic capacity of BE-treated PMN support the potential immunotherapeutic implications of borage and its components for particularly immunocompromised animals and humans."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.
