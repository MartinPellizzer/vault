Pilot studies indicated that single dose administration of extract had little to no acute behavioural effects, hence the extract was administered orally at different dose levels once daily for three consecutive days, while lorazepam (LR) (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered acutely. Ethanolic extract of A. pindrow (AP) leaves (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant anxiolytic effects on all the paradigms of anxiety. The results indicate that AP and LR induced a significant increase in open field ambulation and slight increase in rearings and activity in center, whereas grooming and faecal droppings remain unchanged. In EPM, significant augmentation of open arm entries, and time spent on open arms was noted in AP treated rats. In EZM test, significant increase in time spent on open arms and entries in open arms was observed, whereas slight increase in head dips and stretched attend postures was also observed. The AP extract showed consistent and significant anxiolytic activity in all the tests. The effects induced by ethanolic extract of AP were less marked than those of lorazepam were."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Institute of Technology and Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi 221 005 India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "R K", "Initials": "RK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaiswal", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Acharya", "ForeName": "S B", "Initials": "SB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O26FZP769L", "NameOfSubstance": "Lorazepam"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Exploratory Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lorazepam"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Maze Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11218810"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
