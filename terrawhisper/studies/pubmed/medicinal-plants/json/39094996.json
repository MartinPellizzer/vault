Initially, pseudoternary phase diagrams were developed using \u03b1-bisabolol as the oil phase, Eumulgin\u00ae CO 40 as the surfactant, Polymol\u00ae HE as the co-surfactant, and distilled water as the aqueous phase. Two transparent liquid systems (TLS) containing 5% of \u03b1-bisabolol were selected and characterized (F5E25 and F5EP25). Next, skin permeation and retention assays were performed using Franz cells. The interaction of the formulation with the stratum corneum (SC) was evaluated using the FTIR technique. The cytotoxicity was evaluated in murine peritoneal macrophages. Finally, the antileishmanial activity of microemulsions was determined in promastigotes and amastigotes of L. amazonensis (strain MHOM/BR/77/LTB 0016). As a result, the selected formulations showed isotropy, nanometric size (below 25\u00a0nm), Newtonian behavior and pH ranging from 6.5 to 6.9. The MEs achieved a 2.5-fold increase in the flux and skin-permeated amount of \u03b1-bisabolol. ATR-FTIR results showed that microemulsions promoted fluidization and extraction of lipids and proteins of the stratum corneum, increasing the diffusion coefficient and partition coefficient of the drug in the skin. Additionally, F5E25 and F5EP25 showed higher activity against promastigotes (IC<sub>50</sub> 13.27 and 18.29, respectively) compared to unencapsulated \u03b1-bisabolol (IC<sub>50</sub> 53.8). Furthermore, F5E25 and F5EP25 also showed antileishmanial activity against intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonensis, with IC<sub>50</sub> 50 times lower than free \u03b1-bisabolol and high selectivity index (up to 15). Therefore, the systems obtained are favorable to topical administration, with significant antileishmanial activity against L. amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes, being a promising system for future in vivo trials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
