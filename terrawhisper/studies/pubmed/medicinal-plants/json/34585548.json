NB framing itself with a mineral coat that assists as a primary defence shield against the immune system, antibiotics. This study aims to collect and detect nanobes from different kidney stones from patients with active urolithiasis then investigated the anti-nano-bacterial activity of some antibiotics alone or in combination with extracts of irradiated herbs of certain medicinal plants which will represent a new approach to therapy for patients with kidney stones. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Total of 32 nanobes were isolated from 54 kidney stones. Fourier Transforms Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that calcium and phosphate are the main components of stones. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), showed that nanobes were Gram-ve cocci with size ranged from (375:600 nm). The biofilm production ability of nanobes was estimated qualitatively and quantitatively. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The results revealed that all were strong biofilm producers. Further, the antibiotic susceptibility test indicates their resistance towards most of the tested antibiotics. Molecular identification of the strong biofilm producer isolates by ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) revealed that it is indicated by 85.37% to &lt;i&gt;Bartonella apis&lt;/i&gt; strain PEB0122. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; The findings of the current study evidenced that combination treatment between Doxycycline (DO) and water extract of khella exhibited a significant reduction in biofilm formation ability of the strongest producers nanobes. Therefore, this treatment can play a role in enhancing public health, especially with patients who suffer from recurrent kidney stone formation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fayez Hassan", "ForeName": "Nora", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khaled Ibrahim", "ForeName": "Mohamed", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yousef El Tablawy", "ForeName": "Seham", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abd Allah Farrag", "ForeName": "Hala", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcifying Nanoparticles"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Calcifying Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Egypt"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Calculi"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "21"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34585548", "10.3923/pjbs.2021.953.970"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
