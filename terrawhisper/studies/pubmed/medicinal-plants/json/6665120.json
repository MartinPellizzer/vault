Control and exposed roots were grown concomitantly in the same tank whose medium was continuously circulated and maintained at 19 degrees C. The experiments were conducted blind. Root growth rates were determined daily and the mitotic index was determined for various intervals over a 24-h period, ranging from 12 h before to 12 h after electrode energization. Root growth rates were affected in a dose dependent relationship by exposures greater than 250 V/m. Mitotic indices were not affected by 150 V/m but were affected at 350 V/m; the former exposure did not alter root growth rates, the latter did. The growth rates of vertically exposed roots were compared to those of horizontally exposed roots; the former are more sensitive at a given field strength. The observations are consistent with the postulate that the electric field acts upon the cell through a perturbation of the transmembrane potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "M W", "Initials": "MW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dooley", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cox", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carstensen", "ForeName": "E L", "Initials": "EL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Radiat Environ Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0415677", "ISSNLinking": "0301-634X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electricity"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Stain Technol. 1953 Nov;28(6):281-3", "ArticleIdList": ["13113454"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Environ Biophys. 1981;19(3):227-33", "ArticleIdList": ["7267989"]}, {"Citation": "Radiat Environ Biophys. 1980;18(4):289-300", "ArticleIdList": ["7220793"]}, {"Citation": "J Physiol. 1927 Sep 9;63(4):357-77", "ArticleIdList": ["16993895"]}, {"Citation": "IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 1976 Jul;23(4):347-54", "ArticleIdList": ["1278928"]}, {"Citation": "Bioelectromagnetics. 1981;2(4):329-40", "ArticleIdList": ["7326055"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6665120", "10.1007/BF01323679"]}}]}
