It was hoped that this would result in the retrieval and in an increase in the value attributed to information concerning this nonsystematized knowledge present in a controversial and poorly accepted form in the practices of the population. One hundred and five teachers and 162 students of the 1st to 4th grades of the four primary schools on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte were interviewed. One hundred and five of the teachers answered the questions put. Twenty-three (32.4%) of the teachers said they believed in special cures, 69 (65.7%) thought that certain diseases could be treated with homemade remedies for these, 54 (78.3%) were able to associate a particular disease with a particular medicinal plant and 15 (21.7%) prescribed a treatment without any association with a particular disease, 36 (34.3%) cited a disease without relating this to a particular herb. One hundred and one (62.3%) of the students believed that homemade remedies are effective for certain diseases. Amongst the teachers and students various diseases were mentioned as well as different symptoms and organs that can be cured by medicinal plants, roots or traditional healers. A little more than 50% of the two groups of students (1st and 2nd grade, 3rd and 4th grade) live in families who make use of traditional healers to provide alternative cures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centro de Pesquisas Ren\u00e9 Rachou/FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte, Brasil."}], "LastName": "dos Santos", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dias", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martins", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Conhecimento e uso da medicina alternativa entra alunos e professores de primeiro grau."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Rev Saude Publica", "NlmUniqueID": "0135043", "ISSNLinking": "0034-8910"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Brazil"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Education"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "School Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teaching"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8539534", "10.1590/s0034-89101995000300010"]}}]}
