This review assessed the synergistic efficacy of herbal medicine (HM) and probiotics for PFC.", "We conducted a comprehensive search of 11 databases, including English, Chinese, and Korean databases, until June 29, 2023. The inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the intervention of HM with probiotics to that of the same probiotics. Statistical analyses included calculation of the mean difference (MD), standardized MD, risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and assessment of risk of bias using Review Manager Version 5.4 software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation rating system was used to evaluate evidence quality. Potential publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger test, the fail-safe N test, and Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.", "A total of 22 RCTs involving 2228 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The HM and probiotics group exhibited superior outcomes compared to the probiotics alone group in various parameters: total effective rate (RR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.19-1.29, P\u2005<\u2005.001), Bristol fecal Score (MD: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.89, P\u2005<\u2005.001), gastrointestinal peptide hormone (motilin) (MD: 35.37, 95% CI: 24.64-64.10, P\u2005<\u2005.001), inflammation indicator (nitrous oxide) (MD: -12.45, 95% CI: -15.12 to -9.77, P\u2005<\u2005.001), minimal sensitive volume of the rectum (MD: -8.7, 95% CI: -10.91 to -6.49, P\u2005<\u2005.001), and recurrence rate (RR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.21-0.43, P\u2005<\u2005.001).", "The combination of HM and probiotics may exhibit a synergistic effect on PFC.
