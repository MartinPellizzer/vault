F, has been widely used in China for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and has also been validated by modern science and developed as a candidate anti-cancer treatment. However, liver toxicity of TP has seriously hindered its use and development, the clinical features and primary toxicological mechanism have been unclear. Considering the major target regulation mechanism of TP is the suppression of global transcription regulated by RNAPII, which is closed related with the detoxification of drugs. This paper tries to verify the synergistic liver injury and its mechanism of TP when co-administered with CYP3A4 substrate drug. The experiments showed that TP dose-dependently blocked transcriptional activation of CYP3A4 in both hPXR and hPXR-CYP3A4 reporter cell lines, lowered the mRNA and protein expression of PXR target genes such as CYP3A1, CYP2B1, and MDR1, and inhibited the functional activity of CYP3A in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) and female Sprague-Dawley (f-SD) rats. Furthermore, TP combined with atorvastatin (ATR), the substrate of CYP3A4, synergistically enhanced hepatotoxicity in cultured HepG2 and SCRH cells (CI is 0.38 and 0.29, respectively), as well as in f-SD rats, with higher exposure levels of both drugs. These results clearly indicate that TP inhibits PXR-mediated transcriptional activation of CYP3A4, leading to a blockade on the detoxification of itself and ATR, thereby greatly promoting liver injury. This study may implies the key cause of TP related liver injury and provides experimental data for the rational use of TP in a clinical scenario."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
