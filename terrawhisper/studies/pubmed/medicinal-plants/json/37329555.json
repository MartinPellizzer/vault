Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) derived from the root of the licorice plant is one of the plant compounds whose effectiveness has been confirmed in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD). Liposome thin film hydration method was used to synthesize chitosan-coated liposomes containing GA. In the present study, chitosan-coated liposome was characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The FTIR spectrum confirmed the coating of liposomes by chitosan polymer. \u00a0Liposome coating leads to an increase in the size and values of zeta potential. The 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay of chitosan-coated liposomes containing GA confirmed that it has no cytotoxicity toward fibroblasts cell line, therefore confirming their cytocompatibility. Overall, drug loading, release and cytotoxicity were evaluated and it was found that chitosan decreased the release rate of GA. It seems; chitosan-coated liposomes may be a suitable system for delivering liposomal GA in the treatment of IBD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. taherehnaseriyeh@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Naseriyeh", "ForeName": "Tahereh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanobiotechnology Department, Faculty of Innovative Science and Technology, Razi University Kermanshah, Iran. dkahrizi@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. alvandi.chemist94@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Alvandi", "ForeName": "Hosna", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. aghazfaranak@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Aghaz", "ForeName": "Faranak", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. e.arkan@kums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Nowroozi", "ForeName": "Ghazal", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. alishamsi2336@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Shamsi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. e.arkan@kums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Omid", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nano Drug Delivery Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran. elhamarkan@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Arkan", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Liposomes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adhesives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liposomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adhesives"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Particle Size"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "19", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "8"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "16"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "10"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37329555", "10.14715/cmb/2023.69.4.1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
