To carry out this literature review, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) instructions were used. Articles on the potential of medicinal plants and natural substances of marine origin against wound healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis were explored. The scientific databases considered were PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and SpringerLink. The scientific documents collected were mainly scientific articles, books, book chapters, and doctoral thesis. The research considered 73 manuscripts published in the period from 1990 to 2020. From all the data collected, it appears that the scientific literature is rich in medicinal herbs and marine products to be valorized in the wound healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We have identified 15 medicinal plants traditionally used in the management of healing or ulcer of cutaneous leishmaniasis, 32 medicinal plants whose efficacy has been demonstrated in vitro or in vivo against cutaneous leishmaniasis, 5 marine products active against cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is also clear that the option of medicinal herbs/marine products in the management of cutaneous leishmaniasis is less expensive and allows to avoid the side effects of conventional products. It is necessary to encourage the development of dermatological topicals for the management of cutaneous leishmaniasis based on the data collected. In vivo research should be intensified on medicinal herbs traditionally used in wound healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
