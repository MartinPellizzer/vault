In this regard, the effectiveness of various gold nanoparticles as radiosensitizer has been proven. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of liposomes containing gold ions (Gold-Lips) and glucose-coated gold nanoparticles (Glu-GNPs) on radiation sensitivity of B16F0 melanoma cells.", "Naked GNPs, Glu-GNPs and Gold-Lips were synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated using DLS. The cytotoxicity and sensitivity of the nanoparticles to radiation were evaluated using MTT and colony formation assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the apoptotic effect of nanoparticles on B16F0 cells. The intracellular ROS levels and mRNA expression of Bax, Bcl-2, p53, Caspase-3, and Caspase-7 genes were also evaluated. Finally, caspase 3/7 activity was determined using a luminescence assay kit.", "The results revealed that GNPs, Glu-GNPs, and Gold-Lips had a desired size and zeta potential. Results from the colony assay showed that the all non-toxic concentrations of Gold-Lips significantly increased cell death in B16F0 cells compared with the Glu-GNPs (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Flow cytometry and Caspase-3/-7 activity confirmed the results of the colony assay and showed that increasing the sensitivity of cells to radiation increases apoptosis. Moreover, we found that Gold-Lips increased the mRNA expression of p53, Bax, and Caspase-3/-7, and decreased the Bcl-2 mRNA expression.", "Overall, both Gold-Lips and Glu-GNPs enhanced the radiosensitivity of B16F0 cells, however, Gold-Lips had better effects, which could make them a promising tools in cancer radiotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
