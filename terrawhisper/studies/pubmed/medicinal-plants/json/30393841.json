The origin of BC is multifactorial and depends on environmental and genetic factors. The disease presents a significant challenge due to its drug resistance and frequent metastasis. Thus, new effective therapies and metastasis prevention are much needed. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenol which possesses the ability to inhibit BC cell proliferation and demonstrates cytotoxic properties against those cells. In our study, we examined the effect of RA on the expression of ZEB1, MDM2, ABCB1, PTEN and TWIST1 genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.", "MCF-7 cell cultures were treated with 0.2 \u03bcM doxorubicin (DOX) and 1.5, 15 or 50 \u03bcM of RA. Real-time PCR reaction was performed to analyze gene expression levels.", "PCR analysis showed a significant increase of the ZEB1 gene expression, which was about 3-fold for DOX 0.2 \u03bcM, 9-fold for 0.2 \u03bcM DOX + 1.5 \u03bcM RA and 0.2 \u03bcM DOX + 15 \u03bcM RA (p < 0.05), and about 6.5-fold for 0.2 \u03bcM DOX + 50 \u03bcM RA (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a decrease of the MDM2 gene expression was observed in all of the examined variants and was about 40-75% (p < 0.05). No influence of DOX and RA combined with DOX on the ABCB1, TWIST1 and PTEN genes was found.", "The results of our study suggest that RA might be used as an adjuvant therapeutic factor in BC treatment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Juskowiak", "ForeName": "Bogna", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants, Kolejowa 2, 62-064 Poznan, Poland. aniabogacz23@o2.pl."}], "LastName": "Bogacz", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wolek", "ForeName": "Marlena", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kami\u0144ski", "ForeName": "Adam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uzar", "ForeName": "Izabela", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seremak-Mrozikiewicz", "ForeName": "Agnieszka", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Czerny", "ForeName": "Bogus\u0142aw", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Ginekol Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "0374641", "ISSNLinking": "0017-0011"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Breast Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30393841", "10.5603/GP.a2018.0092", "VM/OJS/J/58733"]}}]}
