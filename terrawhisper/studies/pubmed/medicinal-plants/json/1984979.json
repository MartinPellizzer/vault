Baseline FEV1 and FVC did not differ between the two groups. Cough threshold, as assessed by the lowest concentration of inhaled capsaicin eliciting cough, was related to workplace exposure (p = 0.05), displaying a bimodal pattern of higher and lower cough thresholds among the Capsicum workers as compared to a unimodal distribution among the nonexposed workers. Within the exposed group, a higher cough threshold was significantly related to male gender (p = 0.03) and was associated to a lesser extent with dietary preference for hot food (p = 0.09) and cumulative cigarette smoking (p = 0.07).", "Chronic occupational exposure to chili peppers is associated with complaints of cough but does not alone lead to decreased responsiveness of capsaicin-sensitive nerves when assessed by cough threshold. The cough response to capsaicin inhalation may be modified by the effects of multiple, potentially interactive factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of California, SF 94143-0924."}], "LastName": "Blanc", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Juarez", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boushey", "ForeName": "H A", "Initials": "HA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "HL-24136", "Acronym": "HL", "Agency": "NHLBI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Chest", "NlmUniqueID": "0231335", "ISSNLinking": "0012-3692"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bronchial Provocation Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cough"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Occupational Exposure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spirometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1984979", "10.1378/chest.99.1.27", "S0012-3692(16)30239-2"]}}]}
