Major HMs fraud events seem to occur with a certain regularity, such as substitution by counterfeits, adulteration by addition of inferior production-own materials, adulteration by chemical compounds, and adulteration by addition of foreign matter. The assessment of HMs fraud is in urgent demand to guarantee consumer protection against the four fraudulent activities. In this review, three analysis platforms (targeted, non-targeted, and the combination of non-targeted and targeted analysis) were introduced and summarized. Furthermore, the integration of analysis technology and chemometrics method (e.g., class-modeling, discrimination, and regression method) have also been discussed. Each integration shows different applicability depending on their advantages, drawbacks, and some factors, such as the explicit objective analysis or the nature of four types of HMs fraud. In an attempt to better solve four typical HMs fraud, appropriate analytical strategies are advised and illustrated with several typical studies. The article provides a general workflow of analysis methods that have been used for detection of HMs fraud. All analysis technologies and chemometrics methods applied can conduce to excellent reference value for further exploration of analysis methods in HMs fraud."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Zhimin", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Mei Quan", "Initials": "MQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Yingmei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Institute, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jinyu", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9004784", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8347"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemometrics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fraud"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33840329", "10.1080/10408347.2021.1905503"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
