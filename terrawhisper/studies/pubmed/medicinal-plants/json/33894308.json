As people age, they become more susceptible to disease and disability due to various factors like low immunity, decreased functionality of cells, DNA damage, higher incidence of inflammation, etc. Healthy aging is very important. The nutrition and health of the elderly is often neglected. Nutritional interventions could play an important part in the prevention of degenerative conditions of the elderly and an improvement of their quality of life. The medicinal properties of plants are always believed for its therapeutic effect and its efficiency in treating many without adverse effects. The role of phytomedicine in aging is very crucial as it possesses important bioactive compounds and constituents (such as polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and others) which are considered to provide anti-aging properties as well as helps in reducing age-associated problems. Some natural leaves such as Moringa oleifera, curry leaves, guava leaves, green tea, olive leaves, Ginkgo biloba, thankuni leaves, grape leaves, vasaka leaves, and kulekhara leaves are found to have therapeutic effects against diseases like cancer, diabetes, immunosuppression, hepatic damage, and neurodegenerative disorders. Hence, this review aims at understanding the effectiveness of these natural products in curing the geriatric population and the mechanism by which the therapeutic effects are exerted by them."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
