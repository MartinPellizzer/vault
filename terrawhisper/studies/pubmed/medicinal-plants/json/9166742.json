The present study examines whether neurotoxicity of L-ODAP is the result of an interference in the metabolism of any amino acid and if it could form the basis to explain the species differences in susceptibility. Thus, Wistar rats and BALB/c (white) mice, which are normally resistant to L-ODAP, became susceptible to it following pretreatment with tyrosine (or phenylalanine), exhibiting typical neurotoxic symptoms. C57BL/6J (black) mice were, however, normally susceptible to L-ODAP without any pretreatment with tyrosine. Among the various enzymes associated with tyrosine metabolism examined, the activity of only tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) was inhibited specifically by L-ODAP. The inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to tyrosine (Ki = 2.0 +/- 0.1 mM) and uncompetitive with respect to alpha-ketoglutarate (Ki = 8.4 +/- 1.5 mM). The inhibition of TAT was also reflected in a marked decrease in the rate of oxidation of tyrosine by liver slices, an increase in tyrosine levels of liver, and also a twofold increase in the dopa and dopamine contents of brain in L-ODAP-injected black mice. The dopa and dopamine contents in the brain of only L-ODAP-injected white mice did not show any change, whereas levels of these compounds were much higher in tyrosine-pretreated animals. Also, the radioactivity associated with tyrosine, dopa, and dopamine arising from [14C]tyrosine was twofold higher in both liver and brain of L-ODAP-treated black mice. Thus, a transient increase in tyrosine levels following the inhibition of hepatic TAT by L-ODAP and its increased availability for the enhanced synthesis of dopa and dopamine and other likely metabolites (toxic?) resulting therefrom could be the mechanism of neurotoxicity and may even underlie the species differences in susceptibility to this neurotoxin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Shasi Vardhan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pratap Rudra", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Neurochem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985190R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3042"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ketoglutaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1TG777QI25", "NameOfSubstance": "oxalyldiaminopropionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.6.1.5", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine Transaminase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ketoglutaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neurotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine Transaminase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9166742", "10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68062477.x"]}}]}
