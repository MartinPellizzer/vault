The lactose-BSA conjugate was coupled to Sepharose 4B activated by cyanogen bromide. The molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE were a 31 kD of A-chain and a 35 kD of B-chain. Amino acid analysis and N-terminal sequencing were performed. The effects of pH, temperature and guanidine chloride on the conformation of the lectin were investigated by measuring its intrinsic fluorescence and compared with its hemagglutinating activities. Blue shift was detected on the acidic pH and there was a close relationship between activities and conformation of the lectin. Under denaturing conditions, the tryptophan emission profile of lectin showed typical denaturational red shift which also correspond to the conformations and activity of lectin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Environmental and Life Science, Seoul Women's University, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "W B", "Initials": "WB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-galactoside"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JU58VJ6Y3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Guanidine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Denaturation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9875471", "10.1007/BF02974638"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
