These medicinal plants were common and relatively cheap. The eight 10% water extracts were made from the peel of Citrus reticulata Blanco (PCR), fruit of Phyllanthus emblica L. (FPE), root of Pueraria Lobata (Willd.) Ohwi (RPL), rhizome of Polygonatum sibiricum Red (RPS), root of Astragalus propinquus Schischkin (RAP), bud of Hemerocallis citrina Baroni (BHC), seed of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn (SNN) and fruit of Prunus mume (Sieb.) Sieb.etZuce (FPM). The results showed that among all exposures, the treatment with FPE resulted in the significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of Cd and Pb concentration in shoots and roots of S. nigrum by 32.5% and 65.2% for Cd, and 38.7% and 39.6% for Pb. The biomasses of S. nigrum in all plant extract treatments were not significantly changed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared to the control (CK). The Cd and Pb extraction rates of S. nigrum in FPE treatment were increased respectively by 60.5% and 40.5% compared to CK. Though the treatment with EDTA significantly improved (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the concentration of Cd and Pb of S. nigrum, the Cd and Pb masses (ug plant<sup>-1</sup>) of S. nigrum did not show any significant difference compared to the CK due to the significant decrease in the shoot (20.4%) and root (22.0%) biomasses. The chelative role of FPE might be relation with its higher polyphenolic compounds. However, not sure if the contents of polyphenolic compounds was the only differences between FPE and other additives. Thus, some unknown organic matters might also play active role.
