It is a leading cause of death and affects huge amount of people worldwide. Plant-based medicines have been utilised in the therapies for many illnesses that have defied western treatments, including neurodegenerative diseases.", "This review presents an overview of the major neurodegenerative diseases and reported prominent medicinal plants used in managing those diseases in West Africa.", "Scientific articles regarding medicinal plants and their usefulness in managing neurodegenerative diseases in West Africa were pooled from different scientific databases. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to filter articles based on their relevance. Pharmacological activity, plant parts used, experimental models, and some isolated chemical compounds of those plants were summarised.", "In the West Africa region, Fabaceae (19%) and Solanaceae (13%) have the highest representation of plant families used to treat neurological diseases, while Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae have also been utilised. Flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, terpenoids, coumarins present in those plants and their derivatives are reported to possess neuro-protective effects. Biochemical enzymes correlating to antioxidants, anti-inflammatory effects are the potential targets against neurodegenerative diseases.", "Medicinal plants for anti-neurodegenerative diseases in West Africa have been documented with their neuropharmacological activities. Plant families such as Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, and Euphorbiaceae could be a major natural source for discovery of anti-neurodegenerative drugs, thus the metabolites from them should be given priority for neurological research. This review will provide clues for further investigations on the screening and development of anti-neurodegenerative natural products from West African medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
