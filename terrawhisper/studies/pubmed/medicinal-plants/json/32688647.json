Our study showed that ear carbon sink was limited, and sugar was accumulated, hexokinase activities and levels of phosphorylated sugar were increased within the flag leaves, grain nitrogen sink capacity was enhanced, and flag leaf senescence was accelerated under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. However, if the ear of the main stem was covered, these responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> were absent, and the senescence of flag leaf was not accelerated by elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, it appeared that elevated CO<sub>2</sub> accelerated the rate of flag leaf senescence, depending on ear photosynthesis. The ears have far higher enhancement of net photosynthesis than flag leaves, and the role of the flag leaf relative to the ear was declined in supplying C assimilation to grain under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that as CO<sub>2</sub> rises, the grain sink needs the N more than C assimilate from flag leaf, so the declining rates of N% and soluble proteins concentration were markedly accelerated under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. This suggests that, the large increase in ear net photosynthesis accelerated grain filling, accelerated remobilising N within flag leaf as the result of the greater grain nitrogen sink capacity. In addition, as the result of grain carbon sink limitation, it limited the export of flag leaf sucrose and enhanced sugar cycling, which was the signal to accelerate leaf senescence. Hence, elevated CO<sub>2</sub> subsequently accelerates senescence of flag leaf."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Chunwu", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Jianguo", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Qing", "Initials": "Q"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Zubing", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Haoyan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, PR China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cao", "ForeName": "Jiling", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Center for Research and Development of Medicinal Plants, Jiangsu Institute of Botany, Chinese Academic of Science/Nanjing Botanical Garden Mem.
