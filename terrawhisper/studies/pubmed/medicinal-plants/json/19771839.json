The fingerprint reference was determined as one of the most typical chromatograms and used to be compared with other samples through Cosine and Relative Euclid Distance methods, thus the chromatographic fingerprints of flavonoids from Houttuynia cordata were evaluated by constitutes and contents, respectively.", "Fourteen mutual peaks were fixed in the HPLC fingerprint of flavonoids from Houttaynia cordata. It showed good results in validation tests in which the quercitrin's peak was set as the reference peak to calculate relative retention time and area of other peaks in the chromatograms, and the RSD were less than 0.2% and 5.0%, respectively. The linear ranges for quercitrin was 1.07-83.4 microg/mL (r=0.9999) and the average recovery was 100.3%.", "The method shows good repeatability, ruggedness and reliability.
