Each laboratory received identical samples of dry food reference material (homogeneous powders, milk powder, pork muscle and haricot vert beans), which were recently certified for major dietary components and elements. Each laboratory was requested to perform the analyses by its own methods. Results for fat-soluble vitamins are reported. All participants isolated the fat-soluble vitamins by alkaline saponification. For retinol, only high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), reversed- or normal-phase, was applied, with both ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence detection. Results in milk powder showed a relative standard deviation of reproducibility (RSDReprod) of only 10%. Carotene was determined by HPLC (reversed- and normal-phase) and with open-column chromatography at atmospheric pressure. For beta-carotene results in milk powder agreed very well; the RSDReprod was 14%. The values reported for haricot vert beans showed poor agreement; the RSDReprod was 52%. A major part of this variability was due to differences in methodological principles. The results for alpha-tocopherol in milk powder and haricot vert beans agreed very well, with RSDSReprod of 16 and 15%, respectively. Only HPLC (reversed- and normal-phase) with UV and fluorescence detection was applied."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "DLO-State Institute for Quality Control of Agricultural Products (RIKILT-DLO), Wageningen, The Netherlands."}], "LastName": "Hollman", "ForeName": "P C", "Initials": "PC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Slangen", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wagstaffe", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Faure", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Southgate", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Finglas", "ForeName": "P M", "Initials": "PM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Analyst", "NlmUniqueID": "0372652", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2654"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01YAE03M7J", "NameOfSubstance": "beta Carotene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11103-57-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-18-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamin E"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36-88-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Carotenoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carotenoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin A"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamin E"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta Carotene"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8323043", "10.1039/an9931800475"]}}]}
