Expensive and time-consuming methods for natural product purification, especially natural products with bioactive properties, have encouraged chemists to synthesize those compounds in laboratories. Due to their significant role in drug discovery and chemical biology, natural products have become a major area of synthetic organic chemistry. Most medicinal ingredients available today are healing agents derived from natural resources, such as plants, herbs, and other natural products.", "Materials were compiled using the three databases of ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. For this study, only English-language publications have been evaluated based on their titles, abstracts, and full texts.", "Developing bioactive compounds and drugs from natural products has remained challenging despite recent advances. A major challenge is not whether a target can be synthesized but how to do so efficiently and practically. Nature has the ability to create molecules in a delicate but effective manner. A convenient method is to imitate the biogenesis of natural products from microbes, plants, or animals for synthesizing natural products. Inspired by the mechanisms occurring in the nature, synthetic strategies facilitate laboratory synthesis of natural compounds with complicated structures.", "In this review, we have elaborated on the recent syntheses of natural products conducted since 2008 and provided an updated outline of this area of research (Covering 2008-2022) using bioinspired methods, including Diels-Alder dimerization, photocycloaddition, cyclization, and oxidative and radical reactions, which will provide an easy access to precursors for biomimetic reactions. This study presents a unified method for synthesizing bioactive skeletal products."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shakour", "ForeName": "Neda", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohadeszadeh", "ForeName": "Manijeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7440-44-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomimetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "19", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37073153", "10.2174/1389557523666230417083143", "MRMC-EPUB-130960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
