Stock solution of different concentration was inoculated on Petri plates containing <i>C. albicans</i> and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 48 h. The inhibition zones were measured in millimeters using Vernier caliper. The collected data were analyzed using statistical test like mean value and one-way analysis of variance.", "Maximum zone of inhibition for the <i>C. albicans</i> was 42 mm at concentrations of 50% for the oil of lemongrass; followed by cinnamon 40 mm, garlic 24 mm and tulsi 20 mm.
