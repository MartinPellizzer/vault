Rats were treated with both fractions and LOS orally for four weeks and in the experiment day (28th) AngII intravenously injected and cardiovascular parameters (Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR)) directly were recorded by a power lab system.", "AngII could significantly increase SBP and MAP (P<0.001) and decrease HR with respect to the control and these responses were attenuated by LOS. The SBP and MAP in both doses of EA+ AngII and the higher dose of AQ fractions + AngII were significantly lower than the AngII group (P<0.05 to P<0.001). Bradycardia induced by AngII was also reduced by LOS and both fractions. The comparison of two fractions also showed that the effect of EA fraction is greater than the AQ.", "This study indicates that both fractions of the ZJ extract have a beneficial effect on hypertension. Because effect of EA was greater than AQ, we suggested that antihypertensive effects of ZJ mediated polar and nonpolar compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamkar-Del", "ForeName": "Yasamin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohebbati", "ForeName": "Reza", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khajavirad", "ForeName": "Abolfazl", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurogenic Inflammation Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shafei", "ForeName": "Mohammad N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cardiovasc Hematol Disord Drug Targets", "NlmUniqueID": "101269160", "ISSNLinking": "1871-529X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11128-99-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Angiotensin II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76845O8NMZ", "NameOfSubstance": "ethyl acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Angiotensin II"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ziziphus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "8", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31746299", "10.2174/1871529X19666191119141400", "CHDDT-EPUB-102473"]}}]}
