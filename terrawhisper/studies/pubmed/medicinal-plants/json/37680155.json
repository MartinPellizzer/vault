Olibanum has therapeutic effects on various diseases. The effect of Olibanum on memory deficit induced by scopolamine (Sco) was challenged.", "Four groups were considered as (1) control (2) Sco, (3-4) Sco - Olib 100 and 200 mg/kg. Treatment by Olib or vehicle was done for two weeks. The third week was accompanied by the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) with Sco injection. On the last day, the brain and hippocampus were used for evaluation of the malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a total thiol group.", "Sco increased the traveled time and distance to reach the hidden platform during five days of learning (p<0.01 - p<0.001) whereas it decreased the traveled time and distance (p<0.05- p<0.01) in the target area during the probe test of MWM. Sco also decreased delay time in the PA test (P<0.05 - P<0.001). Sco also decreased CAT, SOD, and thiol, whereas it, increased MDA in both the cortex and hippocampus (p<0.01 - p<0.001). Olib attenuated the impaired performance of the rats induced by Sco in MWM and PA tests. Olib reversed the increasing effects of Sco on MDA in both cortex and hippocampus and also reversed the attenuating effects of Sco on CAT, SOD, and thiol.", "Olib had an inhibitory effect on memory deficit induced by Sco probably through its anti-oxidant property."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Medical Physics, Faculty of Medicine, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Marefati", "ForeName": "Narges", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neuroscience Research Center, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Paramedical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences, Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Beheshti", "ForeName": "Farimah", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Jiroft University of Medical Sciences, Jiroft, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salmani", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bigham", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101269163", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5249"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "7"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37680155", "10.2174/1871524923666230901142436", "CNSAMC-EPUB-134227"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
