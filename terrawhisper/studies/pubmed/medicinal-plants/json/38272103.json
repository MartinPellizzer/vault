Incarvillea diffusa Royle (ID) is a traditionally used medicinal herb in the Miao Minzu of Guizhou province, China, for treating urolithiasis. However, the active components and the underlying mechanism of its pharmacodynamic effects remain unclear.", "This study aimed to investigate the potential inhibitory effect of the active component of ID on the formation of CaOx nephrolithiasis and elucidate the underlying mechanism.", "In vivo, a CaOx kidney stone model was induced in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using an ethylene glycol and ammonium chloride protocol for four weeks. Forty-eight male SD rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a08): blank group, model group, apocynin group, and low, medium, and high dose of ID's active component (IDW) groups. After three weeks of administration, rat urine, serum, and kidney tissues were collected. Renal tissue damage and crystallization, Ox, BUN, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CRE, GSH, MDA, SOD contents, and levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, MCP-1, caspase-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in urine, serum, and kidney tissue were assessed using HE staining and relevant assay kits, respectively. Protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, p38, p65, and Toll-4 in kidney tissues was quantified via Western blot. The antioxidant capacities of major compounds were evaluated through DPPH, O<sub>2\u00b7</sub><sup>-</sup>, and \u00b7OH radical scavenging assays, along with their effects on intracellular ROS production in CaOx-induced HK-2\u00a0cells.", "We found that IDW could significantly reduce the levels of CRE, GSH, MDA, Ox, and BUN, and enhancing SOD activity. Moreover, it could inhibit the secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, MCP-1, caspase-1, and decreased protein expression of Nrf2, HO-1, p38, p65, and Toll-4 in renal tissue. Three major compounds isolated from IDW exhibited promising antioxidant activities and inhibited intracellular ROS production in CaOx-induced HK-2\u00a0cells.", "IDW facilitated the excretion of supersaturated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and decreased the production of Ox, BUN in SD rat urine, and mitigated renal tissue damage by regulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Importantly, the three major compounds identified as active components of IDW contributed to the inhibition of CaOx nephrolithiasis formation. Overall, IDW holds significant potential for treating CaOx nephrolithiasis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
