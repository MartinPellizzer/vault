In this study, the topical effects of ammoniacum gum extract on wound healing were investigated in white male rats.", "Following skin wound induction in aseptic conditions, 48 Wistar rats were divided into six equal groups; phenytoin cream 1% (standard), untreated (control), Eucerin (control), and 5%, 10% and 20% ointments of <i>Dorema ammoniacum</i> gum extract (treatment groups). All experimental groups received topical drugs daily for 14 days. The percentage of wound healing, hydroxyproline content, histological parameters, and growth factors (endothelial growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1) were measured in experimental groups.", "The areas of the wounds in the treatment groups were significantly decreased compared with the wound areas of control groups at 5, 7 and 10 days after wounding. On the 12th day, the wounds in the treatment groups were completely healed. Hydroxyproline contents were significantly increased in the treatment groups compared with the control groups (p<0.001). In histological evaluation, the re-epithelialisation, increasing thickness of the epithelial layer, granulation tissue and neovascularisation parameters in the treatment groups showed significant increases compared with the control groups. Also, serum levels of TGF-\u03b2, PDGF, EGF and VEGF in the treatment groups were significantly increased compared to the control groups.", "The topical application of ammoniacum gum extract significantly increases the percentage of wound healing in rats and reduces the time of wound closure."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Siahpoosh", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Malayeri", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salimi", "ForeName": "Anayatollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Medical Basic Science Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorsandi", "ForeName": "Layasadat", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Persian Medicine and Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abdevand", "ForeName": "Zeinab Zaheri", "Initials": "ZZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Wound Care", "NlmUniqueID": "9417080", "ISSNLinking": "0969-0700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endothelial Growth Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6158TKW0C5", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenytoin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "62229-50-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Epidermal Growth Factor"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76057-06-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Transforming Growth Factors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RMB44WO89X", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxyproline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelial Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epidermal Growth Factor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxyproline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenytoin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Platelet-Derived Growth Factor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factor beta"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Transforming Growth Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Wound Healing"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "14", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36240871", "10.12968/jowc.2022.31.Sup10.S16"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
