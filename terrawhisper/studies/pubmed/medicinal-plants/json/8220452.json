Strong positive and negative cis-elements which modulate quantitative expression of the transgene in the light and the dark have been detected within the petE promoter. Disruption of a negative regulatory element at -784 bp produced the strongest photosynthesis-gene promoter so far described. Histochemical analysis demonstrated that all petE-GUS constructs directed expression in chloroplast-containing cells, and that a region from -176 bp to +4 bp from the translation start site was sufficient for such cell-specific expression. The petE-promoter fusions were expressed at high levels in etiolated transgenic tobacco seedlings but there was no marked induction of GUS activity in the light. The endogenous tobacco plastocyanin genes and the complete pea plastocyanin gene in transgenic tobacco plants were also expressed in the dark, but showed a three- to sevenfold increase in the light. This indicates a requirement for sequences 3' to the promoter for the full light response of the petE gene."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, UK."}], "LastName": "Pwee", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gray", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Plant J", "NlmUniqueID": "9207397", "ISSNLinking": "0960-7412"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9014-09-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastocyanin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.31", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucuronidase"}], "GeneSymbolList": ["petE", "uidA"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucuronidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Histocytochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plastocyanin"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Promoter Regions, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis, DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Deletion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8220452", "10.1046/j.1365-313x.1993.t01-26-00999.x"]}}]}
