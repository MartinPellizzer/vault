Salvia species showed sensitivity with a zone diameter of 12-16\u00a0mm. Concentrations of 0.5\u00a0mg/ml to 16\u00a0mg/ml by the dilution method were used to determine the Minimum inhibited concentration (MIC) and Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBK). The MIC values of the plants are mostly 0.5\u00a0mg/ml - 4\u00a0mg/ml and MBC values are between 0.5\u00a0mg/ml - 8\u00a0mg/ml. Antifungal activity findings are remarkable on the species and it has been observed to have very high effects especially on Candida parapsilosis. When the antioxidant research findings are examined; It was observed that Salvia marashica and Salvia caespitosa plants have approximately 75% antioxidant activity at 1\u00a0mg/ml, and findings mostly directly proportional between concentrations and antioxidant activity capacity were recorded. MCF-7 and HUVEC cell lines were used to investigate anticancer activity properties. In line with the findings, while the IC50 value of Salvia marashica on the MCF-7 Cell line was 0.125\u00a0mg/ml, it was 1.65\u00a0mg/ml in the HUVEC cell line, while the IC50 value of Salvia caespitosa on the MCF-7 Cell line was 0.115\u00a0mg/ml in the HUVEC Cell line. It was found to be 9.87\u00a0mg/ml. It has been proven that both Salvia species have a cytotoxic effect on the MCF-7 Cell line."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
