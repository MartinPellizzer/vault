This results in aflatoxin B1 (AFB<sub>1</sub> ) accumulation in kernels, which is hazardous for human health due to its carcinogenic activity. In this study, the mechanism used by exogenous \u03b2-aminobutyric acid (BABA) treatment for attenuating Aspergillus decay, minimizing aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub> ) accumulation, and maintaining nutritional quality in fresh-in-hull pistachio kernels, infected by A. flavus during storage at 25\u2009\u00b0C for 18\u2009days, was investigated.", "Results of an in vivo assay showed that the spore germination and germ tube elongation of A. flavus was repressed by BABA treatment at 7.5\u2009mM. Aspergillus decay accompanied by AFB<sub>1</sub> accumulation was also minimized in fresh-in-hull pistachio kernels treated with BABA at 7.5\u2009mM and infected by A. flavus. Fresh-in-hull pistachio kernels, infected by A. flavus, treated with BABA at 7.5\u2009mM, also exhibited higher phenol and flavonoid accumulation and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging capacity accompanied by higher phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzyme activity.", "Promoting phenylpropanoid pathway activity with higher PAL enzyme activity in fresh-in-hull pistachio kernels treated with BABA may not only reduce Aspergillus decay in kernels by cell wall fortification but also may be favorable for maintaining the kernels' nutritional quality through its effects on ROS scavenging capacity. As oxidative stress, represented by ROS accumulation, is responsible for A. flavus growth and AFB1 accumulation, higher phenol and flavonoid accumulation in fresh-in-hull pistachio kernels treated with BABA may be beneficial for attenuating Aspergillus decay and minimizing AFB1 accumulation. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1586-347X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aghdam", "ForeName": "Morteza Soleimani", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8232-9739"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Agro-Products Postharvest Handling of Ministry of Agriculture, Zhejiang Key Laboratory for Agro-Food Processing, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China."}], "LastName": "Luo", "ForeName": "Zisheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aminian-Dehkordi", "ForeName": "Roghayeh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticultural Science, Imam Khomeini International University, Qazvin, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jannatizadeh", "ForeName": "Abbasali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Ahar Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tabriz, Ahar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Farmani", "ForeName": "Boukaga", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Forestry and Medicinal Plants, Ahar Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tabriz, Ahar, Iran."}], "LastName": "Younessi-Hamzekhanlu", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Higher Education Center Shahid Bakeri Miyandoab, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ahmadpour", "ForeName": "Abdollah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Horticulture, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zanjan, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Razavi", "ForeName": "Farhang", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminobutyrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4282SA5CTS", "NameOfSubstance": "3-aminobutyric acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9N2N2Y55MH", "NameOfSubstance": "Aflatoxin B1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aflatoxin B1"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aminobutyrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aspergillus flavus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Food Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pistacia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Sheikhi A, Mirdehghan SH and Ferguson L, Extending storage potential of de-hulled fresh pistachios in passive-modified atmosphere.
