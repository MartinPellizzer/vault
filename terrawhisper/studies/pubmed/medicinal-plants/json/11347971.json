However, some of the compounds considered to be selective may not be as selective in humans as in rats, and may not be very selective versus the new AR subtypes A3 or A2B. Partial agonists have been developed that may exhibit fewer side effects than full agonists. Low water solubility of many A1 antagonists remains a problem. A1 AR antagonists can be classified as neutral antagonists or inverse agonists; the pharmacological consequences of inverse agonism versus neutral antagonism will have to be the subject of future investigations. Some medicinal plants (e.g. Hypericum perforatum and Valeriana officinalis) contain compounds that are antagonists or partial agonists at A1 ARs; effects on ARs may contribute to their pharmacological activity. 18F- and 11C-labeled A1 AR antagonists have been developed for positron emission tomography studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Bonn, Pharmaceutical Institute, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Germany. christa.mueller@uni-bonn.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "M\u00fcller", "ForeName": "C E", "Initials": "CE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Farmaco", "NlmUniqueID": "8912641", "ISSNLinking": "0014-827X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Purinergic P1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Purinergic P1"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}], "NumberOfReferences": "13"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11347971", "10.1016/s0014-827x(01)01005-9", "S0014-827X(01)01005-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
