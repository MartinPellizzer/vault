There are rich cultivated varieties and wild germplasm resources in R. glutinosa. However, there also exist a lot of problems, such as, the pedigree of the existing varieties is not clear, the genetic basis is narrow, backward method of germplasm enhancement and breeding. Breeding of new varieties has been unable to meet the demand of R. glutinosa production in the new era. This paper summarizes the species of Rehmannia and their distribution, the diversity of plant morphology and the quality of R. glutinosa germplasm resources, as well as the progress of R. glutinosa breeding in recent 100 years. For ensuring the orderly, effective and safe production of R. glutinosa, the authors suggest to establish the wild resources protection area and germplasm resources garden, deeply study the genetic base of quality, strengthen application of new breeding method such as mutation breeding, haploid breeding and gene editing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou 450002, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Feng-Qing", "Initials": "FQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450046, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Cai-Xia", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiudao Seedling Propagation and Cultivation Co., Ltd., Jiaozuo 454950, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Rui-Bin", "Initials": "RB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Crop Science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhong-Yi", "Initials": "ZY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30583618", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180820.012"]}}]}
