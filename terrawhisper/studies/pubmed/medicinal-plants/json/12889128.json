Asahipak NH2P-50 column was used, the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water (90:10) at a flow-rate of 1.2 mL.min-1, and detection wavelength was set at UV 265 nm.

The concentration-time curves of trigonelline in rabbits after ig and i.v. administration were shown to fit one-compartment and two-compartment open model, respectively. The main parameters after ig of fenugreek extract were as follow: T1/2(Ka) was 0.9 h, T1/2(Ke) was 2.2 h, V was 0.64 L.kg-1, AUC was 1.93 mg.min.L-1.
