This book had many names of the plants, animals and minerals. In the plant kingdom, there were many names of cereals, vegetables, fruits, trees, bamboos, herbs, seaweeds and mushrooms. In this report, I studied the species of the trees which were listed by the Chinese and local names. I identified them and found 106 species. Among them, 68 species were medicinal plants. For example, the names of gardeniae fructus, forsythiae fructus, phellodendri radix and magnoliae radix were found as the famous medicinal plants. The ratio of the medicinal plants was 64%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Kumamoto Institute of Technology."}], "LastName": "Hamada", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Biography", "English Abstract", "Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakushigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "1267223", "ISSNLinking": "0285-2314"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Botany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "PersonalNameSubjectList": [{"LastName": "Kumamoto family"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11639700"]}}]}
