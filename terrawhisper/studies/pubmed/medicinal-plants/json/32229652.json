Due to the side effects of drugs, the tendency to use natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents to regulate metabolism, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia in PCOS patients has been increased. This review aimed to investigate the role of herbal substances on the treatment of PCOS. Methods The present review was carried out using keywords such as polycystic ovary syndrome and/or PCOS and/or herb. Databases including Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct were used to collect all related articles published from 1990 to 2019. We excluded studies unrelated to the PCOS and medical herbs. Results Overall, 361 records were identified through database searching. After primary screening and the full-texts assessment, 323 records were excluded, and 38 articles were finally included. The results indicate that some medicinal herbs may have a key role in treating PCOS. The compounds in these medical herbs can affect lipid profiles (Aloe vera, chamomile, and cinnamon), insulin resistance (cinnamon, chamomile, Aloe vera, and Camellia sinensis), blood glucose (Aloe vera, cinnamon, and Camellia sinensis), hormones (Aloe vera, silymarin, chamomile, fenugreek, Camellia sinensis, Heracleum persicum, Potentilla, Mentha spicata, Foeniculum vulgar, licorice, and Marrubium), and ovarian tissue (Aloe vera, chamomile, Camellia sinensis, Mentha spicata, and silymarin). Conclusion Natural substances such as Aloe vera, cinnamon, green tea, fenugreek, and silymarin can be used as a new supportive care for PCOS. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm their benefits and safety."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of clinical nutrition, school of nutrition and food science, Shiraz University of medical science, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ashkar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, PhD student in Nutrition, School of Nutrition and Food Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rezaei", "ForeName": "Shahla", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of clinical nutrition, school of nutrition and food science, Shiraz University of medical science, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salahshoornezhad", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Assistant professor in nutrition, Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Health, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahid", "ForeName": "Farhad", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Students Research Committee, Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholamalizadeh", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Guilan; University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dahka", "ForeName": "Samaneh Mirzaei", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Health and Environment, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doaei", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Biomol Concepts", "NlmUniqueID": "101518829", "ISSNLinking": "1868-5021"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Silymarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum zeylanicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insulin Resistance"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Silymarin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Trigonella"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32229652", "10.1515/bmc-2020-0005", "/j/bmc.2020.11.issue-1/bmc-2020-0005/bmc-2020-0005.xml"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
