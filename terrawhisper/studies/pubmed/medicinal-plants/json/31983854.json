This study investigated the effects of this substance on the expression of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) enzyme as well as proliferation and mortality rates of MG63 human osteoblast-like cells. <b>Materials and methods:</b> The MG63 cells were cultured and the effect of 100, 200 and 300 \u03bcg/ml of mumie extract on cell viability were compared with zoledronic acid and estradiol valerate as positive controls, as well as with MG63 cells alone as the negative control group. The activity rate of the BALP enzyme was also assessed. <b>Results:</b> During 48 hours of the study period, the concentrations of 100 and 200\u03bcg/ml of mumie extract increased the proliferation rate and decreased the mortality rate of MG63 cells significantly; however, the concentration of 300\u03bcg/ml decreased the proliferation rate and increased the mortality rate of the cells. Also, BALP enzyme expression was slightly affected by 100 and 200 \u03bcg/ml of mumie extract whilst it was significantly decreased by the concentration of 300 \u03bcg/ml. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study showed that mumie extract has an increasing effect on proliferation rate and a decreasing effect on the mortality rate of osteoblast cells in low concentrations; however, the higher concentrations of this substance could be toxic and effect inversely."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 Journal of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Researches Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abbasi", "ForeName": "Naser", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Researches Center, Faculty of Health, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizpour", "ForeName": "Yosra", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Researches Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Monireh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Researches Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Karimi", "ForeName": "Elahe", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Researches Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aidy", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology and Medicinal Plants Researches Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ilam University of Medical Sciences, Ilam, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asadollahi", "ForeName": "Khairollah", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Stem Cells Regen Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101552911", "ISSNLinking": "0973-7154"}, "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Radfar M, Hamishehkar H, Entezari T.
