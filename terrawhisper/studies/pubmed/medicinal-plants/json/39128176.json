The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for innovative approaches to design lead compounds with the potential to become effective drugs. Specifically, designing promising inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is crucial, as it plays a key role in viral replication. Phytochemicals, primarily flavonoids and flavonols from medicinal plants, were screened. Fifty small molecules were selected for molecular docking analysis against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB ID: 6LU7). Binding energies and interactions were analyzed and compared to those of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor Nirmatrelvir. Using these 50 structures as a training set, a QSAR model was built employing simple, reversible topological descriptors. An inverse-QSAR analysis was then performed on 2\u2079\u00a0=\u00a0512 hydroxyl combinations at nine possible positions on the flavone and flavonol scaffold. The model predicted three novel, promising compounds exhibiting the most favorable binding energies (-8.5\u00a0kcal/mol) among the 512 possible hydroxyl combinations: 3,6,7,2',4'-pentahydroxyflavone (PF9), 6,7,2',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (PF11), and 3,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyflavone (PF15). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated the stability of the PF9/Mpro complex over 300 ns of simulation. These predicted structures, reported here for the first time, warrant synthesis and further evaluation of their biological activity through in vitro and in vivo studies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
