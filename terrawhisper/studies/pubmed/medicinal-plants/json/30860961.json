The International Complementary and Alternative Medicine Questionnaire (I-CAM-Q) elicited use of conventional health-care providers, traditional healers, and complementary therapies in the previous 12 months. <b>Results</b>: Most of the farmworkers had been treated by a conventional provider (63.0%). One-in-five had been treated by any traditional healer; 19.5% had been treated by a sobador, 4.5% by a curandero, 2.0% by an herbalist, and 2.0% by a spiritual healer. Conventional providers (69.8%) and sobadores (84.6%) most often treated acute conditions; 62.5% had used an herb, 46.0% a vitamin, 57.0% an over-the-counter medicine, and 13.5% a home remedy. Participants used various self-care practices, including music (36.5%), sleep (18.0%), prayer for health (15.0%), and social media (14.0%). Education was inversely associated with the use of a traditional healer and herbs; treatment by a conventional health-care provider was positively associated with using a traditional healer and vitamins. <b>Conclusions</b>: Mexican farmworkers use conventional health-care providers as well as traditional healers and complementary therapies. Research on how use of complementary therapies and a system of medical pluralism affects farmworker health is needed. Health-care providers need to recognize complementary therapy use and provide patient education about ineffective or harmful therapies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Family and Community Medicine , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , USA."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Center for Worker Health , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , USA."}], "LastName": "Arcury", "ForeName": "Thomas A", "Initials": "TA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Family and Community Medicine , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , USA."}], "LastName": "Furgurson", "ForeName": "Katherine F", "Initials": "KF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Family and Community Medicine , Meharry Medical College , Nashville , Tennessee , USA."}], "LastName": "O'Hara", "ForeName": "Heather M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Family and Community Medicine , Meharry Medical College , Nashville , Tennessee , USA."}], "LastName": "Miles", "ForeName": "Kenya", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Biostatistical Science, Division of Public Health Sciences , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , USA."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Haiying", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Radiology , Wake Forest School of Medicine , Winston-Salem , North Carolina , USA."}], "LastName": "Laurienti", "ForeName": "Paul J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R01 ES008739", "Acronym": "ES", "Agency": "NIEHS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T03OH009406", "Acronym": "ACL", "Agency": "ACL HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Agromedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9421530", "ISSNLinking": "1059-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Farmers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North Carolina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Self Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Transients and Migrants"}], "CoiStatement": "Disclosure: Authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Hernandez T, Gabbard S, Carroll D.
