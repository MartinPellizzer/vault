In rats, pretreatment with DAS has been observed to suppress completely the induction of oesophageal neoplasms by N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBzA) (Wargovich et al. (1988) Cancer Res., 48, 6872-6875). This communication reports the effects of DAS on overall NMBzA metabolism and on DNA methylation of NMBzA in vivo under conditions equivalent to a single treatment of the chemoprevention assay. Male Fischer 344 rats received a single i.g. dose of DAS (200 mg/kg body wt) followed by an s.c. injection of [methyl-14C]NMBzA (3.5 mg/kg). In controls, exhalation of 14CO2 was complete within 5 h (t1/2max = 1.2 h), with 50% of the injected radioactivity recovered as 14CO2. When DAS was given 3 h prior to [methyl-14C]NMBzA, 49% of the injected radioactivity was released within 10 h (t1/2max = 3 h). When DAS was administered 18 h before the carcinogen, 42% of [methyl-14C]NMBzA was converted to 14CO2, with exhalation complete after 6 h (t1/2max = 1.8 h). We further examined the effects of acute doses of 10-200 mg/kg of DAS on DNA methylation by a single dose of NMBzA (3.5 mg/kg; survival time, 6 h) administered 3 h later. At 200 mg/kg, DAS inhibited the formation of O6-methyldeoxyguanosine (O6-MEdG) in oesophagus (-26%), nasal mucosa (-51%), trachea (-68%) and lung (-78%). In liver, levels of 7-MEdG were reduced by 43%. Decreases in DNA methylation were proportional to dose for > 25 mg/kg of DAS in oesophagus, liver and nasal mucosa, for 25-200 mg/kg in trachea and 10-50 mg/kg in lung. The dose-activity relationship for inhibition by DAS of DNA methylation by NMBzA suggests that short-term modulation of carcinogen bioactivation in situ contributes to but may not be sufficient for the chemo-prevention of nitrosamine tumorigenesis by DAS."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland."}], "LastName": "Ludeke", "ForeName": "B I", "Initials": "BI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Domin\u00e9", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohgaki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kleihues", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "937-40-6", "NameOfSubstance": "nitrosobenzylmethylamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "964-21-6", "NameOfSubstance": "O(6)-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G9481N71RO", "NameOfSubstance": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "M43H21IO8R", "NameOfSubstance": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Dimethylnitrosamine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Esophagus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Olfactory Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred F344"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1473259", "10.1093/carcin/13.12.2467"]}}]}
