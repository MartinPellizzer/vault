Medicinal plants are important sources of novel active compounds. Diarylheptanoids, a typical family of secondary plant metabolites, are of great interest owing to their extensive spectrum of biological activities. They possess a unique 1,7-diphenylmethane structural skeleton. Thus, this review summarizes the natural linear or macrocyclic diarylheptanoids with antioxidant activity in the last two decades. In addition, the relationships between the structural characteristics of natural diarylheptanoids and their antioxidant capacity were also discussed. All the available data highlight the potential of natural diarylheptanoids as novel antioxidants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0005-9622-1995"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "An-Na", "Initials": "AN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Component-based Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Tie", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8289-6557"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Ya-Jing", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Chong-Yan", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bing-Jie", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Therapeutic Substance of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Gen", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Therapeutic Substance of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin State Key Laboratory of Component-based Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 301617, People's Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Feng", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "9", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38347784", "10.2174/0109298673282309231226111037", "CMC-EPUB-138453"]}}]}
