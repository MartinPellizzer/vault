However, the studies are not complete and have not involved beans grown in the northwestern regions of Argentina. For this reason, this study was initiated to determine the concentration of protein, moisture, ash, fat, and minerals of various bean samples grown in northwestern Argentina. Six varieties of beans were taken from seven different regions. AOAC standard methods were used for chemical analysis. The elements analyzed for all bean samples show that moisture varies from 12 to 14%, proteins from 18 to 22%, fat from 0.7 to 1.20%, copper from 0.8 to 1.20 mg/100 g, iron from 9 to 18 mg/100 g, zinc from 2.5 to 4 mg/100 g, and phosphorus from 295 to 542 mg/100 g. No arsenic was detected in the bean samples. Different analyzed bean varieties were significantly different for proximate composition and mineral content, and each variety from different regions of northwestern Argentina present significant differences."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional de Jujuy, Av.
