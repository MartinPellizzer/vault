Some of the synthesized target compounds showed potent anti-proliferative activities toward LNCaP (prostate cancer cell line), K562 (human leukemia cells), A549 (human lung carcinoma cell line) and HeLa (cervical cancer cell line) cell lines. Among of the active compounds, (E)-1-(4-(2-(diethylamino)ethoxy)-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)phenyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (C36) was directly interacted with protein kinase B (PKB), also known as AKT, significantly inhibited the pPI3K, pAKT(Ser473) protein levels to repress the growth of cancer cells by inducing apoptosis, arresting cell cycle.
