J. Li et P. K. Hsiao, a stout herb plant from the Polygonaceae, is a typical Tibetan folk herb with heat-clearing and detoxifying effects, but does not have the typical laxative effect compared with other rhubarb plants. Nevertheless, its chemical composition and pharmacological activities still lack in-depth research. The present study endeavored to analyze the possible phytochemical constituents in R. lhasaense and explore the main compound piceatannol-3'-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (PG) effect on cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanism. The chemical profile of R. lhasaense discovered 46 compounds, including 27 stilbenoids and 13 gallotannins using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The UPLC determined the contents of 6 main stilbenoids, among which the content of PG was the highest, up to 61.06\u00a0mg/g. Moreover, behavioral tests showed that PG (40\u00a0mg/kg and 160\u00a0mg/kg) administration markedly ameliorated memory impairments of scopolamine-induced mice. Biochemical parameters showed that PG treatment alleviated the levels of Ach, AchE, and inflammatory factors while elevating the levels of antioxidants in mice. In addition, network pharmacology was performed to reveal PG exert an mild cognitive impairment effect by participating in neurodegenerative disease pathways, proliferation and apoptosis-, and inflammation-related pathways. Eventually, the results of molecular docking and the qRT-PCR revealed that PG down-regulated the mRNA expressions of MMP3, MMP9 and BACE1 in cognitive impairment mice brain tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PG mitigated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice by targeting the BACE1-MMP3/9 pathway, and PG might be a promising mild AD drug candidate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
