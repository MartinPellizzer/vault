In addition, recent studies have found that NTCP is a functional receptor of HBV and HDV. Therefore, it is important to study the interaction between drugs and NTCP and identify the inhibitors/substrates of NTCP. In the present study, a LLC-PK1 cell model stably expressing human NTCP was established, which was simple and suitable for high throughput screening, and utilized to screen and verify the potential inhibitors of NTCP from 102 herbal medicinal ingredients. The results showed that ginkgolic acid (GA) (13 : 0), GA (15 : 1), GA (17 : 1), erythrosine B, silibinin, and emodin have inhibitory effects on NTCP uptake of TCNa in a concentration-dependent manner. Among them, GA (13 : 0) and GA (15 : 1) exhibited the stronger inhibitory effects, with IC50 values being less than 8.3 and 13.5 \u03bcmol\u00b7L(-1), respectively, than the classical inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA) (IC50 = 20.33 \u03bcmol\u00b7L(-1)). Further research demonstrated that GA (13 : 0), GA (15 : 1), GA (17 : 1), silibinin, and emodin were not substrates of NTCP. These findings might contribute to a better understanding of the disposition of the herbal ingredients in vivo, especially in biliary excretion."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 China Pharmaceutical University.
