Contributing to this predicament is the frequent occurrence of multiple infections with agents that can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, from the frequent symptomless carrier state to overt disease with more or less specific clinical manifestations. In the interpretation of the complex morbidity patterns found in rural populations of tropical countries, it is often difficult to make a clear determination of cause and effect. The situations is further complicated by the low degree of pathognomicity of the clinical manifestations of even the advanced stages of certain parasitic diseases. The paper gives examples that illustrate the interaction between endemic malaria and schistosomiasis as important causes of hepatosplenomegaly. Also shown in the paper are the inter-relationships between the nutritional status and the number of multiple infections with parasites found in African villages as well as the association between habitual coca leaf chewing, malnutrition and hookworm disease in a Peruvian community of mixed ethnic origin. The paper describes micro-epidemiological features of poly-parasitism by comparing the prevalence and intensity of infection with Onchocerca volvulus, Schistosoma mansoni and S; haematobium between sub-groups in the village population who have different sources of domestic water supply. In two African villages with endemic schistosomiasis where mass treatment will be administered, only 25% of the residents with parasitologically confirmed S. haematobium infection and 12% of those with S. mansoni had single infection; the remaining majority had at least one additional patent parasitic infection of public health importance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Buck", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderson", "ForeName": "R I", "Initials": "RI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "MacRae", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Tropenmed Parasitol", "NlmUniqueID": "0423216", "ISSNLinking": "0303-4208"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Coca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hepatomegaly"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Nutrition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Parasitic Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Peru"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schistosoma haematobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Schistosoma mansoni"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Schistosomiasis"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Splenomegaly"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["726041"]}}]}
