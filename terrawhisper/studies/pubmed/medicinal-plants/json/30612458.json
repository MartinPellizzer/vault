Natural medicinal plants that can prevent inflammation by targeting LPS have potential therapeutic clinical application. The aim of the study is to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of lotus seedpod extract (LSE), used as a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with hemostasis function and for eliminating bruise, on the LPS-induced hepatic inflammation and its underlying molecular mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, LSE and its purified compound (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) dose-dependently inhibited the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>\u03b1</mi></math> , interleukin (IL)-6, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), without affecting cell viability in LPS-stimulated human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Molecular studies showed the anti-LPS effect of HLP or EGC might be mediated via downregulation of Toll-like receptor 4. (TLR4)-mediated both NF- <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>\u03ba</mi></math> B and p38 signaling, as demonstrated by the usage of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a specific NF- <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>\u03ba</mi></math> B inhibitor. In vivo, LPS-induced hepatic inflammation was significantly ameliorated in LSE-fed mice as gauged by dose-dependent inhibition of serum levels of biochemical markers of liver damage, the changes of hepatic lobular architecture and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as induction of anti-oxidant enzymes. As a result, our data presented the first evidence of EGC-enriched LSE as an anti-inflammatory agent in LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells and mice, and these findings may open interesting perspectives to the strategy in treatment for hepatic inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2020 Department of Radiation Oncology, School of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tseng", "ForeName": "Hsien-Chun", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021 Department of Nutrition, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "Pei-Min", "Initials": "PM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chou", "ForeName": "Ying-Hsiang", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Yueh-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u00a7 Department of Medical Laboratory and Biotechnology, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Hui-Hsuan", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "* Department of Radiation Oncology, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "\u2021 Department of Nutrition, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung City 40201, Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jing-Hsien", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Singapore", "MedlineTA": "Am J Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7901431", "ISSNLinking": "0192-415X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "8R1V1STN48", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "HEJ6575V1X", "NameOfSubstance": "gallocatechol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Catechin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hep G2 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation Mediators"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lotus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30612458", "10.1142/S0192415X19500083"]}}]}
