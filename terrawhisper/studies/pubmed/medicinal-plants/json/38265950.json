It has been shown that ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP has the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and induce neurotoxicity. In the current study, we investigated the <i>in vivo</i> neurotoxicity, as well as, the cellular mechanism of ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP toxicity on two neuronal-like cell lines, PC12 and N2a. PC12 and N2a cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP (0-2000\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) for 48 h. The apoptotic effect of ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP was determined using annexin V/propidium iodide double staining (by flow cytometry), and western blot analysis of relative apoptotic proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-9, bax, and bcl2. Based on our results, ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP at concentrations of 250-2000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL increased both early and late-stage apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the expressions of cleaved-caspase-3 and -9 proteins and the bax/bcl2 ratio were significantly increased. In addition, oral administration of ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP (50\u00a0mg/kg) to male Wistar rats for 28 days led to the loss of neuronal cells in the cerebral cortex. Taken together, our findings highlighted the role of apoptosis on cytotoxicity induced by ZrO<sub>2</sub>-NP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["48435"], "Affiliation": "Anesthesiology and Critical Care Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Asadpour", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fakharzadeh Moghadam", "ForeName": "Omid", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-3228-6897"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": ["37552"], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghnia", "ForeName": "Hamid R", "Initials": "HR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Toxicol Ind Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8602702", "ISSNLinking": "0748-2337"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S38N85C5G0", "NameOfSubstance": "zirconium oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C6V6S92N3C", "NameOfSubstance": "Zirconium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-2-Associated X Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanoparticles"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurons"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zirconium"}], "CoiStatement": "Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest concerning the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "1", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "52"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38265950", "10.1177/07482337241228622"]}}]}
