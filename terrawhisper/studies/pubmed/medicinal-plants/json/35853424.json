The unavailability of standardised methods for multiclass mycotoxin analysis to assess health risks has thus been realised. This study reports a simple, robust and precise method to estimate nine regulated mycotoxins in a range of Indian medicinal plant matrices including giloy (Tinospora cordifolia), ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), safed musli (Chlorophytum borivilianum), satavari (Asparagus racemosus) and tulsi (Ocimum sanctum). The sample preparation method involved extraction of homogenised matrices (12.5\u00a0g) using methanol:water (8:2, 100\u00a0mL) followed by cleanup through a multi-mycotoxin immunoaffinity column (IAC), which significantly reduced matrix interferences. The method was initially developed and validated using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for the simultaneous analysis of aflatoxins (B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>), ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxin. Later, it was validated using LC-fluorescence (LC-FLD) for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and zearalenone. The optimised sample preparation protocol and analytical method provided acceptable results. Compared to LC-FLD, it was possible to attain a lower limit of quantification (LOQ) with LC-MS/MS for all the tested analytes except aflatoxins. However, LOQs of both instruments were lower than the maximum limits (MLs), with recoveries ranging between 71 and 110% and precision (RSD) of \u226410% across matrices. Despite matrix-induced signal suppressions in LC-MS/MS analysis, the matrix-matched calibrations corrected all recoveries. Considering its accuracy, reliability, robustness and time-effectiveness, this method is recommended for regulatory testing purposes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
