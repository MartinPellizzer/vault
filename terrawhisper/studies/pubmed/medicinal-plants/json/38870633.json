The major purpose of the present study was to investigate the cardioprotective benefits of Echinops cephalotes (Ech) against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to three groups: sham, MI, and MI + Ech. The left coronary artery (LAD) was blocked for 30\u202fminutes to induce MI. In the treatment group, rats were given 150\u202fmg/kg/day of Ech extract for 28 days. Aqueous extracts were made from Echinops plants. To study heart function, fibrosis, cardiac damage indicators, and oxidative stress factors, echocardiography, Masson's trichrome staining, and biochemical tests were used. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP2 and MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) was determined using Western blotting. Tissue damage was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. MI group exhibited significantly reduced ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS), enhanced levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as a decrease in the Glutathione (GSH) tissue content, reduced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), increasing fibrosis, upregulations of MMP-2 and MMP-9, and reduction of TIMP compared to the sham group. The findings suggest that Ech in particular, could be a promising therapeutic agent to reduce the damage in MI by targeting oxidative stress and modulating the activities of matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
