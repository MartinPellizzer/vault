Keeping in view the increased market demand of herbal drugs, it is essential to ensure their chemical quality prior to use. Raw drugs and herbs are usually collected from different places, which might be contaminated with various contaminants. It is pertinent to estimate the levels of heavy metals and other micronutrients, which could be affected by their presence in the surrounding environments. Heavy metals are known to pose a potential threat to terrestrial and aquatic biota. Keeping this in view, samples of ten plants or plant parts used in drug making were collected from local markets of Punjab for heavy metal and micronutrient estimation. It was found that the samples were contaminated having cadmium, lead, chromium, iron, manganese, and zinc. The highest mean level of cadmium (23.1\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) was found in Haritaki sample. Chromium concentration of the plant samples ranged between 7.25 and 1.34\u00a0\u03bcg/kg with the highest values was in Daruharidra and lowest in Pippali. The levels of these heavy metals were within permissible limits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Ayurvedic Pharmaceutical Research, Moti Bagh Road, Patiala, 147001, Punjab, India. ajaysheera@gmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meena", "ForeName": "Ajay Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bansal", "ForeName": "Parveen", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Sanjiv", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garg", "ForeName": "V K", "Initials": "VK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Environ Monit Assess", "NlmUniqueID": "8508350", "ISSNLinking": "0167-6369"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Micronutrients"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Micronutrients"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Environ Pollut. 2006 Sep;143(2):327-34", "ArticleIdList": ["16414161"]}, {"Citation": "Mar Pollut Bull. 2002 Oct;44(10):1136-41", "ArticleIdList": ["12474975"]}, {"Citation": "J Hazard Mater. 2008 Feb 11;150(3):604-11", "ArticleIdList": ["17600619"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2000 Jul 13;406(6792):181-3", "ArticleIdList": ["10910356"]}, {"Citation": "Pediatr Ann. 1992 Jun;21(6):384-8", "ArticleIdList": ["1620563"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2004 May 13;429(6988):174-7", "ArticleIdList": ["15141210"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 2000 Feb 24;403(6772):853-8", "ArticleIdList": ["10706275"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1988 May 12;333(6169):134-9", "ArticleIdList": ["3285219"]}]}], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "8", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20020323", "10.1007/s10661-009-1264-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
