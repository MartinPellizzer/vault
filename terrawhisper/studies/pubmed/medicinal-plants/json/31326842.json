The use of medicinal plant material increases the therapeutical effects of copper nanoparticles. The aim of this study was green synthesis of copper nanoparticles from aqueous extract of Falcaria vulgaris leaf (CuNPs) and assessment of their cytotoxicity, antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, and cutaneous wound healing properties. These nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. The synthesized CuNPs had great cell viability dose-dependently (Investigating the effect of the CuNPs on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line) and indicated this method was nontoxic. Also, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test was done to assess the antioxidant activities, which indicated similar antioxidant potentials for CuNPs and butylated hydroxytoluene. In part of cutaneous wound healing property of CuNPs, after creating the cutaneous wound, the rats were randomly divided into six groups: treatment with 0.2% CuNPs ointment, treatment with 0.2% CuSO<sub>4</sub> ointment, treatment with 0.2% F.\u202fvulgaris ointment, treatment with 3% tetracycline ointment, treatment with Eucerin basal ointment, and untreated control. These groups were treated for 10\u202fdays. Treatment with CuNPs ointment remarkably increased (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01) the wound contracture, vessel, hexosamine, hydroxyl proline, hexuronic acid, fibrocyte, and fibrocytes/fibroblast rate and substantially reduced (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01) the wound area, total cells, neutrophil, and lymphocyte compared to other groups. In antibacterial and antifungal parts of this research, the concentration of CuNPs with minimum dilution and no turbidity was considered minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To determine minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), 60\u202f\u03bcL MIC and three preceding chambers were cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar and Muller Hinton Agar, respectively. The minimum concentration with no fungal and bacterial growth were considered MFC and MBC, respectively. CuNPs inhibited the growth of all fungi at 2-4\u202fmg/mL concentrations and removed them at 4-8\u202fmg/mL concentrations (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01). In case of antibacterial effects of CuNPs, they inhibited the growth of all bacteria at 2-8\u202fmg/mL concentrations and removed them at 4-16\u202fmg/mL concentrations (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.01). The results of XRD, FT-IR, UV, TEM, and FE-SEM confirm that the aqueous extract of F.\u202fvulgaris leaf can be used to yield copper nanoparticles with notable amount of antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, and cutaneous wound healing potentials without any cytotoxicity. Further clinical trials are necessary for confirmation these therapeutical effects of CuNPs in human."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
