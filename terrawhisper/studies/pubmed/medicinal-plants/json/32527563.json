The antifungal activities of these compounds against nine phytopathogenic fungi were evaluated by the mycelium growth rate method. The in vitro antifungal bioassays indicated that most of compounds displayed excellent and broad-spectrum antifungal activities. Especially, compounds 4a, 4c, 4d, 4l and 4r exhibited 1.9-25.5 fold more potent than the commercially available fungicide hymexazol against Corn Curvalaria Leaf Spot (CL), Alternaria alternate (AA), Pyricularia oryzae (PO) and Alternaria brassicae (AB) strains. Structure-activity relationship analysis showed that the enhanced antifungal activity is significantly affected by the substituents on the benzene ring and pyridazine ring."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
