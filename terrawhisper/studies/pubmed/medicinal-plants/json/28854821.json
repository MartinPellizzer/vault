The cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the leaf of Uvaria chamae P. Beauv (Annonaceae) and stem bark of Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae) were investigated in order to provide information on their safety as antimalarial plants. The methanol extract of U. chamae and ethanol (70%) extract of M. lucida were separately orally administered (125, 250, and 750\u2009mg/kg/day) to mice for 10 consecutive days. Cyclophosphamide (50\u2009mg/kg, single dose) and distilled water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The mice were injected with colchicine (0.04%) intra-peritoneally 24\u2009h after the last administration of the extracts and the bone marrows harvested. Giemsa-stained slides of bone marrow cells were microscopically assessed for dividing cells to determine the mitotic index (MI) and scored for chromosomal aberrations (CA) according to standard methods. chamae exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity. At 750\u2009mg/kg, the MI was significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) lower (1.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04) than that of cyclophosphamide (5.83\u2009\u00b1\u20090.04). The lower the MI, the higher the cytotoxicity. The activity of M. lucida was not significantly different (p\u2009>\u20090.05) from that of the negative control. The total CA observed from treatment with both plants at all doses were significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) greater than that of control. This study concluded that U. chamae showed both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity while M. lucida exerted only genotoxic effect. Nevertheless, the two plants should be used with caution in antimalarial therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Awodiran", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adepiti", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science , Obafemi Awolowo University , Ile-Ife , Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akinwunmi", "ForeName": "K F", "Initials": "KF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone Marrow Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Aberrations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitotic Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Morinda"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Uvaria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28854821", "10.1080/01480545.2017.1365884"]}}]}
