Natural products are a potentially important source for bioactive phytochemicals in the management of cancer, which regulate a broad range of biological events via the modulation of interleukins (ILs), pro- and anti-inflammatory modulators, and other cancer hallmark-mediated signaling pathways.", "To systematically review the literature to identify in vivo studies investigating the anticancer properties of medicinal plants and natural molecules as modulators of ILs and their related pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling markers in tumor-bearing animals.", "Articles published in English were searched, without any constraint in respect of countries. The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were used for the literature search for studies published between January 2010 and January 2022. The search terms used included medicinal plants, anticancer, antineoplasic agent, ILs, cytokine, and their combinations. A manual search to detect any articles not found in the databases was also made. The identified studies were then critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized.", "Natural products were found to modulate ILs, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-12, and interferon gamma; increase tissue inhibitor metalloprotease; decrease vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and nuclear factor kappa B; augment immunity by increasing the major histocompatibility complexes II and CD4+, cluster of differentiation 8\u00a0+\u00a0T cell and class II trans-activator expression; and heighten the action of antioxidant enzymes, which are involved in the detoxification of free radicals and reactive oxygen species.", "Natural products discussed in this review show great potential to regulate ILs and weaken associated pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling markers in tumor-bearing animals. Flavonoids, polyphenols, polysaccharides, alkaloids and tannins are important phytochemicals in the modulation of ILs, especially pro-inflammatory ones. However, in terms of future research, the importance of clinical trials to investigate their beneficial properties should be warranted."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
