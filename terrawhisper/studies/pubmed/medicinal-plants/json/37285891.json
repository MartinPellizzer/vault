In this study, we employed ultrafiltration, spectroscopic, molecular docking, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) techniques to investigate the inhibition mechanism of AChE by garlic organic sulfanes, including diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS). The results of UV-spectrophotometry and ultrafiltration experiments showed the inhibition of AChE activity by DAS and DADS was reversible (competitive inhibition), but inhibition by DATS was irreversible. Molecular fluorescence and molecular docking indicated DAS and DADS changed the positions of key amino acids inside the catalytic cavity through hydrophobic interactions with AChE. By using MALDI-TOF-MS/MS, we found DATS irreversibly inhibited AChE activity by opening disulfide-bond switching of disulfide bond 1 (Cys-69 and Cys-96) and disulfide bond 2 (Cys-257 and Cys-272) in AChE, as well as by covalently modifying Cys-272 in disulfide bond 2 to generate AChE-SSA derivatives (strengthened switch). This study provides a basis for further exploration of natural AChE inhibitors using organic active substances in garlic and presents a hypothesis of U-shaped spring force arm effect based on the disulfide bond-switching reaction of DATS that can be used to evaluate the stability of disulfide bonds in proteins."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
