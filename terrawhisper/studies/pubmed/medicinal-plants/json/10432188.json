The broad bean plant, grown in nitrate solution with 193 microM Al3+ at pH 4.8, for 15 days showed Al deposits in the roots. Al accumulation was not detected in the stems nor in the leaves. Al was found mainly localized on the root's surfaces and within the cell walls of the cortical cells. Al signal was not detected in the vascular tissues. Two weeks exposure to Al caused ultrastructural changes in cortical cells and sometimes a complete disruption of these cells. Deposition of Al in form of insoluble complexes associated with phosphorus, appeared as electron opaque materials in the vacuoles of disrupted cortex cells and in the intercellular inclusions. The leaves turned yellowish at the end of 15 days exposure. The use of electron microprobe, to investigate the same tissues as the ones investigated by SIMS, provided complementary results on aluminium allocation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Biophysique, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine, Universit\u00e9 Paris XII-Val de Marne, Cr\u00e9teil, France. mangabei@club-internet.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mangabeira", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mushrifah", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Escaig", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Laffray", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fran\u00e7a", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Galle", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "CPD4NFA903", "NameOfSubstance": "Aluminum"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aluminum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Probe Microanalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Subcellular Fractions"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10432188"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
