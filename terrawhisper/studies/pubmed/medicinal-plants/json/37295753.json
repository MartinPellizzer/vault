Growing studies revealed that OMT has a wide range of beneficial pharmacological values, consisting of anticancer, antidiabetic, antivirus, and antiinflammtion, as well as the protective activities to the brain, liver, heart, lung, vascular, gastrointestinal, bone, kidney, and skin organs. Various in vitro and in vivo models of pharmacological actions were recorded in regard to the usage of alkaloidal OMT. Mechanisms underlying anticancer activity of this compound may have been possibly involved anti-proliferation, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cells, autophagy, especially apoptotic cell deaths. OMT could reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia in a high-fat diet and streptozotocin-stimulated diabetic mice by improving insulin secretion and sensitivity. OMT suppressed gastric ulcer via gastric inflammatory and oxidative inhibitions, and pro-apoptotic actions. It turns out that OMT is relatively safe for cell and animal experiments. In this study, we offer a systematic review of natural occurrence, pharmacological potentials, possible mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability. Clinical research with OMT is needed to extensively elucidate its health potential benefits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
