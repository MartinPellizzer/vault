The TSE extracts were evaluated for its anti-bacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. We found the extracts showed predominant activity against selected bacterial species. The result of the polarized light microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray diffraction (SXRD), and rheology analysis indicated the presence of LCS structures with lamellar arrangement. DSC of the TSE formulas showed higher transition peak temperature at 60 \u00b0c for the phase. SXRD observation of the LCS formulas showed that the structures of the LCS formulas were in the lamellar liquid crystalline phase. Further, to ensure the quality and purity of the TSE ointment, HPLC analysis was performed by measuring the. content of 2 marker substances. The contents of marker substances in the TSE ointment were calculated as 0.078% (paeoniflorin) and 0.031% (glycyrrhizin), respectively. Taken altogether, our study report successful generation of LCS made of 5% TSE ointment and its antimicrobial activity. Moreover, the quantitation of the two active components enable a proper quality control of the TSE extracts, that is essential for the development of ointment products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Jae-Hwan", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Cheong-Weon", "Initials": "CW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Jae-Hun", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "Soo Hyun", "Initials": "SH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Suhwan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Young-Beob", "Initials": "YB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Physiological Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Delayed-Action Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Compounding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Liquid Crystals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26369133", "10.1166/jnn.2015.10461"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
