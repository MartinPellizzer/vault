Although it is not fully assessed, the practice and wider use of traditional medicine is frequent in Ethiopia. Studies conducted previously are confined to the perceptions of modern and traditional health practitioners about traditional medicine. A total of 45 informants were selected purposefully from the study area. For collecting the data, semi-structured interviewees, observation and field walks were employed from August 10 to September 30/2014. To summarize the information, descriptive statistical methods were applied.", "Sixty species of medicinal plants distributed in 42 families were collected and identified applied locally for the treatment of 55 human disorders. The most commonly treated ones were evil eye, malaria, wound, peptic ulcer disease and rabies. According to this study, leaves were the commonly used plant parts (36.5%) and 39% of the preparations were decoctions. Oral route, 43 (44%) was the commonly used route of application whereas most (54.8%) remedies were administered only once. Fourteen percent of preparations caused vomiting in addition most (40.4%) of the formulations was contraindicated for pregnant patients. Only seventeen percent of the formulations possessed drug food interactions. Most preparations were stored within clothes, 31 (29.8%). There exists a high (ICF\u00a0=\u00a00.8) evenness of plant use among healers for treating respiratory problems. Alliumsativum (FI\u00a0=\u00a00.75) for evil eye, Phytolacca dodecandra (FI\u00a0=\u00a00.8) for rabies and Croton macrostachyus (FI\u00a0=\u00a00.78) for treating malaria were medicinal plants with highest fidelity levels showing consistency of knowledge on species best treating power. This study also documented that drought, overgrazing and firewood collection are major threats.", "Dega Damot district is loaded in its medicinal plant diversity and indigenous knowledge though plants are highly affected by drought, overgrazing and firewood collection. Therefore awareness activities must be created among the district's population by concerned governmental and nongovernmental organizations about the value of medicinal plants and conservation of these plants. The healing potential and associated adverse issues of the claimed medicinal plants should be assessed before proposing for a broader utilization."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacy Department, Debre Markos University, Gojjam, Ethiopia. mulukenwubetu1986@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Wubetu", "ForeName": "Muluken", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Abula", "ForeName": "Tefera", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health Department, Debre Markos University, Gojjam, Ethiopia."}], "LastName": "Dejenu", "ForeName": "Getye", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "BMC Res Notes", "NlmUniqueID": "101462768", "ISSNLinking": "1756-0500"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraindications, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethiopia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnopharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Peptic Ulcer"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Rabies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Wounds and Injuries"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Dejene T.
