However, reports on the relationship between them are still inconsistent. In this article, we conducted a meta-analysis on this issue. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases as of November 15, 2019. A random-effects model was used, and subgroups of studies were analyzed using samples of different measurements. Twenty-two original articles were identified (18 trace elements, including a total of 1014 children with ASD and 999 healthy controls). In autistic children, the overall levels of barium (Ba), mercury (Hg), lithium (Li), and lead (Pb) were higher. There were significant differences in the levels of copper (Cu) in the hair and serum between autistic children and the control group. The levels of Hg, Li, Pb and selenium (Se) in the hair of autistic children were higher than those of healthy children, while the levels of zinc (Zn) in the blood were lower. Excessive exposure to toxic heavy metals and inadequate intake of essential metal elements may be associated with ASD. Preventing excessive exposure to toxic metals and correcting poor dietary behaviors may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of the disease."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
