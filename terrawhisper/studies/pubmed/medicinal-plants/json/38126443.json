The current study, which provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis and characterization techniques for CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs, emphasizes the sonochemical method as an efficient and straightforward technique for producing CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs with tunable size and shape. This paper investigates the toxicity and biocompatibility of CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs, as well as their antioxidant and catalytic properties, which allow them to modify the redox state of biological systems and degrade organic pollutants. In addition, the most recent developments in the medicinal applications of CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs, such as cancer treatment, antibacterial activity, biosensing, and drug or gene delivery, are emphasized. In addition, the disadvantages of CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs, such as stability, aggregation, biodistribution, and biodegradation, are outlined, and several potential solutions are suggested. The research concludes with data and recommendations for developing and enhancing CeVO<sub>4</sub> NPs in the biomedical industry."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1598-2487"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran.
