The five compounds examined were kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (TR), kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (AS), isorhamnetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (IS), quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (HY), quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(6-->1)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (RU).", "When the cells were preincubated with these five compounds, the superoxide generation induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) was significantly suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner. The arachidonic acid (AA)-induced superoxide generation was suppressed by TR, AS, HY and RU. On the other hand, the superoxide generation was weakly enhanced by IS in low concentration (5-20 micromol/l), but was suppressed in high concentration (50 micromol/l). The superoxide generation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) suppressed the TR, IS, HY and RU, but AS gave no effect. When the cells were incubated with fMLP in the presence of TR, IS and RU, fMLP-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of 45-kDa proteins of the cells was dose-dependently suppressed in parallel to the suppression of fMLP-induced superoxide generation. These five flavonoids showed almost no hemolytic effect even at a concentration of 500 micromol/l.", "Flavonoid compounds suppressed stimulus-induced superoxide generation and tyrosyl phosphorylation and may have pharmaceutical application."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, No. 103, Wenhua Road, Shenyang 110015, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Huangwei", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chunlei", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamashita", "ForeName": "Koichi", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Manabe", "ForeName": "Masanobu", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Zhiyun", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Suixu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kodama", "ForeName": "Hiroyuki", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "1302422", "ISSNLinking": "0009-8981"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "42HK56048U", "NameOfSubstance": "Tyrosine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "56937-68-9", "NameOfSubstance": "phorbolol myristate acetate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "59880-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "NI40JAQ945", "NameOfSubstance": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Diospyros"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Tyrosine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12417109", "10.1016/s0009-8981(02)00298-x", "S000989810200298X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
