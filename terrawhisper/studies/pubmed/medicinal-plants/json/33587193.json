The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the presence of transition metal particles with atomic numbers 22-29 on some medicinal plants (n\u00a0=\u00a022) from various regions of the Republic of Tajikistan and their content in the atmosphere. Samples (n\u00a0=\u00a043) of individual plant organs, such as seeds, flowers, leaves, trunks, and plant roots, were examined for their elemental composition using X-ray fluorescence analysis. Selection of particles contained in the atmosphere was carried out for 24\u00a0h/3\u00a0days by the aspiration method using fiberglass filters GF 10 in an apparatus installed at an altitude of 864\u00a0m on the periphery of the capital. For the analysis of plant samples, measurements were carried out on a SPECTROSCAN MAX-G wave-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. For samples containing filtered atmosphere elements, a high-resolution PANanalytical Epsilon 5 high-resolution energy-dispersive spectrometer was used. Eight transition elements from the 1st main series of metals with atomic numbers 22-29, such as titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt nickel, and copper, were found in plant organs, as well as in the atmosphere samples. Our results showed that the distribution of metals on plants varied depending on plants and their organs. We did not find any correlation between the region of plant collection and their absorption of metal elements. The distribution of metals varied in various plant organs. In the atmosphere samples, we found all the metals that were found in plants. In conclusion, medicinal plants can adsorb and accumulate some harmful chemical elements in their organs, are involved in the recirculation of these metals, and contribute air pollution."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Innovation and Experimental Medicine, National Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan, 33 Rudaki Av, Dushanbe, 734025, Tajikistan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Paris University, Lariboisier Hospital, CAP-Paris Tech, INSERM U1275, Paris, France."}], "LastName": "Sharofova", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S.U.
