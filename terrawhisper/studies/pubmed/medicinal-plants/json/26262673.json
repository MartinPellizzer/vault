The present study focused on the changes in polyphenols from black carrot, peel, and pomace during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Total phenolic content (TPC), total monomeric anthocyanin content (TMAC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined using spectrophotometric methods, whereas identification and quantification of polyphenols were carried out using UPLC-ESI-MS(E) and HPLC-DAD, respectively. TPC, TMAC, and TAC significantly decreased (23-82%) as a result of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Nevertheless, the amount of pomace anthocyanins released at all stages of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was higher than black carrot anthocyanins, suggesting that pomace may be a better source of bioaccessible anthocyanins. Overall, the current study highlighted black carrot byproducts as substantial sources of polyphenols, which may be used to enrich food products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Human Nutrition (nutriFOODchem), Department of Food Safety and Food Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University , 34469 Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kamiloglu", "ForeName": "Senem", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University , 34469 Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Capanoglu", "ForeName": "Esra", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Engineering, Faculty of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University , 34469 Maslak, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Bilen", "ForeName": "Fatma Damla", "Initials": "FD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Human Nutrition (nutriFOODchem), Department of Food Safety and Food Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Gonzales", "ForeName": "Gerard Bryan", "Initials": "GB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Human Nutrition (nutriFOODchem), Department of Food Safety and Food Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Grootaert", "ForeName": "Charlotte", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory Microbial Ecology and Technology (LabMET), Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Van de Wiele", "ForeName": "Tom", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Human Nutrition (nutriFOODchem), Department of Food Safety and Food Quality, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University , Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium."}], "LastName": "Van Camp", "ForeName": "John", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26262673", "10.1021/acs.jafc.5b02640"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
