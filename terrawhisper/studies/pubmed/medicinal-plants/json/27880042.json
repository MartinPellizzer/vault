The aims of this study were to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of dimethyl sulfoxide extract of M. rubra and to investigate, for the first time, its probable cytotoxic activity in human colon cancer (WiDr) cells, together with the mechanism involved. The cytotoxic activity of extract was determined using MTT assay. The mechanism involved in the cytotoxic effect of extract was then evaluated in terms of apoptosis, and the cell cycle using flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was investigated using the fluorometric method, and expression levels of telomerase and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were investigated using reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). M. rubra extract exhibited moderate selective cytotoxicity on colon cancer cells compared with fibroblast cells. Extract induced cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>1</sub> phase and apoptosis via reduced MMP in WiDr cells. Additionally, M. rubra extract significantly repressed telomerase and induced CHOP expressions in WiDr cells. Our results demonstrate that targeting telomerase and endoplasmic reticulum stress represents a promising strategy in colon cancer therapy, and M. rubra may have considerable potential for development as a novel natural product-based anticancer agent."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Nutrition and Dietetics , Faculty of Health Sciences, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Demir", "ForeName": "Selim", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Genetic and Bioengineering , Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Gumushane University , Gumushane , Turkey."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Medicinal Plants , Traditional Medicine Practice and Research Center, Gumushane University , Gumushane , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Turan", "ForeName": "Ibrahim", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Biochemistry , Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Aliyazicioglu", "ForeName": "Yuksel", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Genetic and Bioengineering , Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Gumushane University , Gumushane , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Kilinc", "ForeName": "Kagan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Biochemistry , Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yaman", "ForeName": "Serap Ozer", "Initials": "SO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Department of Chemistry , Faculty of Sciences, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Ayazoglu Demir", "ForeName": "Elif", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Department of Biotechnology , Institute of Science, Gumushane University , Gumushane , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Arslan", "ForeName": "Ayse", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Biochemistry , Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Mentese", "ForeName": "Ahmet", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Medical Biochemistry , Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University , Trabzon , Turkey."}], "LastName": "Deger", "ForeName": "Orhan", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DDIT3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "147336-12-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factor CHOP"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.49", "NameOfSubstance": "Telomerase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Cycle Checkpoints"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Telomerase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factor CHOP"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27880042", "10.1080/01635581.2017.1247887"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
