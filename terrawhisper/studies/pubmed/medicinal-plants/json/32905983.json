Naturally, they accumulate in plants growing in suboptimal growing conditions, e.g. influenced by biotic and abiotic stressors. With the aim to evaluate the potential use of tomato residues as source, we analyzed both leaf metabolites during a complete cultivation cycle, while applying single and combined stresses practically realized in greenhouse production. In the late season, contents of both metabolites were significantly enhanced by nutrient deficit in combination with 2\u00a0\u00b0C colder nights for 4 weeks and prolonged for in total 9 weeks. Particularly, higher solanesol contents were achieved by salt stress and elevated temperature after one week, even stronger when combined with drought. At harvest, stressed plants consist of less green biomass reducing the overall economic potential. However, practicable abiotic stresses should be considered as potential tool to induce the accumulation of beneficial compounds. Extracting profitable metabolites from the green biomass of the model crop tomato supports the overall goal to promote sustainable approaches in horticultural production."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
