During this process, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils engulf the target by expanding their membranes. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is called efferocytosis. This process is of significant importance as billions of cells are eliminated daily without provoking inflammation. Both phagocytosis and efferocytosis depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. A big family of Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable channels is transient receptor potentials (TRPs) divided into nine subfamilies. We aimed to review their roles in phagocytosis. The present review article shows that various TRP channels such as TRPV1, 2, 3, 4, TRPM2, 4, 7, 8, TRPML1, TRPA1, TRPC1, 3, 5, 6 have roles at various stages of phagocytosis. They are involved in the phagocytosis of amyloid \u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein, myelin debris, bacteria, and apoptotic cells. In particular, TRPC3 and TRPM7 contribute to efferocytosis. These effects are mediated by changing Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling or targeting intracellular enzymes such as Akt. In addition, they contribute to the chemotaxis of phagocytic cells towards targets. Although a limited number of studies have assessed the role of TRP channels in phagocytosis and efferocytosis, their findings indicate that they have critical roles in these processes. In some cases, their ablation completely abolished the phagocytic function of the cells. As a result, TRP channels are potential targets for developing new therapeutics that modulate phagocytosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
