In replicate experiments, RGE significantly inhibited BaP-DNA adduct formation at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/ml. SAC also significantly decreased BaP-DNA adduct formation at concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml. For diallyl sulfide, no significant reduction in BaP-DNA adduct formation was found. BaP-DNA adduct formation was not associated with cell viability or proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes after the various treatments. No clear scavenging activity was detected for the garlic constituents. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity was not decreased, nor was formation of sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of 3-hydroxy-BaP increased in the presence of RGE and SAC, indicating that increased glutathione S-transferase activity or a more efficient repair of BaP-DNA adducts may explain the observed effects. In addition, reactive oxygen species-induced 8-oxodeoxyguanosine in DNA was reduced in the presence of SAC. It is concluded that raw garlic and SAC may be useful in the prevention of BaP-associated tumorigenesis and that further evaluation of their preventive potential in humans at risk appears feasible."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Health Risk Analysis and Toxicology, University of Limburg, Maastricht, The Netherlands.
