The present study investigated and compared the morpho-physiological and biochemical changes of Leonurus cardiaca L. plants as affected by various concentrations (0, 250, 500 and 1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) of nZVI and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The foliar uptake of nZVI was verified through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analytical spectra. Plants exposed to nZVI at low concentration showed comparatively monotonic deposition of NPs on the surface of leaves, however, the agglomerate size of nZVI was raised as their doses increased, leading to remarkable changes in anatomical and biochemical traits. 250\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> nZVI and 500\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased plant dry matter accumulation by 37.8 and 27% over the control, respectively. The treatments of nZVI and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> at 250\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) improved chlorophyll a content by 22.4% and 15.3% as compared to the control, and then a rapid decrease (by 14.8% and 4.1%) followed at 1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Both nZVI and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> at 250\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> had no significant impact on malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, however, at an exposure of 500-1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, the MDA levels and cellular electrolyte leakage were increased. Although nZVI particles could be utilized by plants and enhanced the synthesis of chlorophylls and secondary metabolites, they appeared to be more toxic than Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> at 1000\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>. Exposure to nZVI levels showed positive, negative and or neutral impacts on leaf water content compared to control, while no significant difference was observed with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> treatments. Soluble sugar, total phenolics and hyperoside content were significantly increased upon optimum concentrations of employed treatments-with 250\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> nZVI being most superior. Among the extracts, those obtained from plants treated with 250-500\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> nZVI revealed the strong antioxidant activity in terms of scavenging free radical (DPPH) and chelating ferrous ions. These results suggest that nZVI (at lower concentration) has alternative and additional benefits both as nano-fertilizer and nano-elicitor for biosynthesis of antioxidant metabolites in plants, but at high concentrations is more toxic than Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
