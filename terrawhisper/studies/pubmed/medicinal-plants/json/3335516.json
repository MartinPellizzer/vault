Deletion mutations were introduced into the 57-amino acid transit peptide of a chloroplast protein, the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, from pea. A mutant, PSd48/57, in which nine carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the transit peptide had been deleted, was imported and processed to a series of 13- to 18-kDa polypeptides including the 14-kDa mature small subunit. In contrast, processing of a mutant, PSd45/57, in which an additional three amino acids had been removed, resulted in a series of polypeptides which did not include the mature small subunit. Whereas PSd48/57 was imported as efficiently as the wild-type precursor, import of PSd45/57 was only 25% as efficient as that of the authentic precursor. The mutant precursor proteins PSd48/57 and PSd45/57 are distinguished by a three-amino acid sequence, Ile-Thr-Ser, located in the carboxyl-terminal region of the transit peptide. We show that all or part of this sequence is required for correct processing."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721."}], "LastName": "Wasmann", "ForeName": "C C", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Reiss", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bohnert", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromosome Deletion"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3335516", "S0021-9258(19)35396-7"]}}]}
