They have been found free or as glycosides/esters by combining with sugars. Most of them act as signaling molecules and function in stress response. They are also the material basis for the therapeutic effect of various medicinal plants. Modern pharmacological research has shown that they have the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-tumor, fertility-regulating, and immunomodulatory effects. They top plant natural products in both quantity and diversity, and among them, tetrachyclic triterpenes and pentachyclic triterpenes are most abundant. The first step of the structural diversification is the cyclization 2,3-oxidosqualene, which is catalyzed by oxidosqualene cyclases(OSCs). Numerous OSCs exist, each with a specific cyclization mechanism, and thus over 100 different cyclic triterpene skeletons have been found in nature. This study reviewed the research on the biosynthetic pathways of triterpenes in medicinal plants, regulatory mechanisms of the pathways, and the key enzymes, and analyzed the expression regulation and structural characteristics of key enzyme genes involved in the synthetic pathways. This study is expected to serve as a reference for further research on triterpenes, such as the directional regulation of metabolic flow and heterologous biosynthesis and lay a basis for the regulation of triterpene synthesis and the selection of high-quality germplasm. This study also provides basic materials for further research and development of triterpenes from medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture, Guangxi University Nanning 530004, China Center for Genomics and Biotechnology of Haixia Institute of Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "An", "ForeName": "Chang", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agriculture, Guangxi University Nanning 530004, China Center for Genomics and Biotechnology of Haixia Institute of Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Qin", "ForeName": "Yuan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Biotechnology of Haixia Institute of Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Fang", "ForeName": "Yun-Ying", "Initials": "YY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Plant Science and Technology,Huazhong Agricultural University Wuhan 430070, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Bing-Rui", "Initials": "BR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Genomics and Biotechnology of Haixia Institute of Technology, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University Fuzhou 350002, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604904", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220918.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
