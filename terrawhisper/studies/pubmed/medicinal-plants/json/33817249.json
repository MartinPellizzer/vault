The material used in the experiment consisted of extra virgin and refined olive oil samples. Fatty acid profiles of olive oil samples were monitored after each heating cycle (10\u2009min). The outcomes showed that cycles of heat treatment cause significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) differences in the fatty acid profile of olive oil. A similar trend of differences (<i>p</i> < 0.05) was found between fatty acid profiles in extra virgin and refined olive oils. As expected, the main differences occurred in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Cross-correlation analysis also showed differences between the fatty acid profiles. The most prolific changes were observed between the control samples and the heated (at 180\u00b0C) samples of refined olive oil in PUFAs, though a heating temperature of 220\u00b0C resulted in similar decrease in MUFAs and PUFAs, in both extra virgin and refined olive oil samples. The study showed differences in fatty acid profiles that can occur during the culinary heating of olive oil. Furthermore, the study indicated that culinary heating of extra virgin olive oil produced results similar to those of the refined olive oil heating at a lower temperature below 180\u00b0C."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Dani Dordevic et al., published by De Gruyter."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Origin Foodstuffs Hygiene and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Hygiene and Ecology, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, 61242, Brno, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Technology and Organization of Public Catering, South Ural State University, 454080, Chelyabinsk, Russia."}], "LastName": "Dordevic", "ForeName": "Dani", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kamenice 753/5, 62500, Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Kushkevych", "ForeName": "Ivan", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Origin Foodstuffs Hygiene and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Hygiene and Ecology, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, 61242, Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Jancikova", "ForeName": "Simona", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetic Resources for Vegetables, Centre of the Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Medicinal and Special Plants, Crop Research Institute, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Phytochemistry, Centre of Region Han\u00e1 for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, 78371, Olomouc, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Zeljkovic", "ForeName": "Sanja Cavar", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Origin Foodstuffs Hygiene and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Hygiene and Ecology, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, 61242, Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Zdarsky", "ForeName": "Michal", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Origin Foodstuffs Hygiene and Technology, Faculty of Veterinary Hygiene and Ecology, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, 61242, Brno, Czech Republic."}], "LastName": "Hodulova", "ForeName": "Lucia", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Open Life Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101669614", "ISSNLinking": "2391-5412"}, "CoiStatement": "Conflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Kuli\u0161i\u0107 T, Berkovi\u0107 K, Pavi\u0107 S, \u0160ustra A.
