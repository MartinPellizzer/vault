Therefore, the selection of stable reference genes during seed dormancy release is very important for the subsequent functional research of related genes. In this study, ten commonly used reference genes(GAPDH, 40S, actin, tubulin, EIF4A-9, EIF2\u03b1, UBC, UBCE2, 60S, and UBQ) were selected as candidates for quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) of the embryo samples of A. tsaoko at different dormancy release stages. Three kinds of software(BestKeeper, geNorm, and Normfinder) and the Delta CT method were used to evaluate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes, and the RefFinder online tool was employed to integrate the results and generate a comprehensive ranking. The results showed that the expression levels of the ten candidate reference genes differed greatly in different embryo samples. GAPDH and UBC had high expression levels, as manifested by the small Ct values. GeNorm identified 40S and UBCE2 as the most stable genes. NormFinder ranked EIF2\u03b1 as the most stable gene and UBC as the least stable gene. UBCE2 was found to be the most stable gene and actin the least stable one by BestKeeper. Delta CT analysis suggested that the expression of 40S was most stable. UBCE2 was recommended as the most stably expressed gene by RefFinder. Thus, UBCE2 is the ideal reference gene for qRT-PCR analysis of A. tsaoko seeds at different dormancy release stages. The results may lay a foundation for analyzing the expression of related genes during seed dormancy release of A. tsaoko."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Li-Xiang", "Initials": "LX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Chun-Liu", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Li-Ying", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Zhu", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Mei-Qiong", "Initials": "MQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Key Laboratory of Medicinal Resources Conservation and Genetic Improvement, Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources General Survey and Data Collection Key Laboratory, Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants Nanning 530023, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amomum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "21"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34472256", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210523.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
