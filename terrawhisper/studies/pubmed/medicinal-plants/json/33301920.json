Anacardium humile St. Hill. (Anacardiaceae) is a typical plant from the Brazilian savanna, popularly known for its antidiarrheal, expectorant, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, however, few studies have fully described its biological properties. This study aimed to investigate in vitro and ex vivo the antioxidant and antiglycation potential of A. humile ethanolic extract, its organic fractions and three isolated molecules (quercetin, catechin and gallic acid), their capacity to inhibit the glycolytic enzyme \u03b1-amylase, as well as their cytotoxic effects against RAW264.7 macrophages.", "The ethanolic extract of A. humile, its organic fractions and three isolated molecules (catechin, quercetin and gallic acid) were tested for their antioxidant (ORAC, FRAP and DPPH) and antiglycation (BSA/Fructose, BSA/Methylglyoxal, Arginine/Methylglyoxal and Lysine/Methylglyoxal) capacities, and also for its potential to inhibit the enzyme \u03b1-amylase. Additionally, bioactive compounds present in the A. humile leaves fractions were elucidated by an HPLC-ESIMS/MS analysis.", "The analysis showed relevant antioxidant activity of DCM (1264.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a076.90\u00a0\u03bcM Trolox eq/g ORAC; 216.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.04\u00a0\u03bcM Trolox eq/g FRAP and 3.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 IC<sub>50</sub> \u03bcg/mL IC<sub>50</sub> DPPH) and EtOAc (1300.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033.04 ORAC, 236.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.86 FRAP and 3.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0\u03bcg/mL IC<sub>50</sub> DPPH) fractions and also of the isolated molecules, mainly gallic acid (1291.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.41\u00a0\u03bcM Trolox eq/g ORAC, 1103.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031.48\u00a0\u03bcM Trolox eq/g FRAP and 0.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0\u03bcg/mL IC<sub>50</sub> DPPH). Concerning the antiglycation activity, all samples inhibited over 88% in the BSA-FRU method. In the BSA-MGO and ARG-MGO methods, the Hex, DCM, EtOAc fractions and the isolated molecule catechin stood out. However, in the LYS-MGO model, only the isolated molecules showed significant results. In \u03b1-amylase assay, all fractions, for exception Hex, presented notable inhibition capacity with low IC<sub>50</sub> values, especially DCM, EtOAc, ButOH and H<sub>2</sub>O (IC<sub>50</sub> 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10, 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, 0.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 and 0.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively). Tests using hepatic tissue showed a notorious capacity of the DCM, AcOEt and ButOH fractions, as well as of the isolated molecules to inhibit lipid peroxidation and ROS production, and also to preserve thiol groups. Molecules of great antioxidant potential were found in our samples, such as kaempferol, quercetin, catechin, gallic acid and luteolin.", "A. humile extract and its organic fractions showed promising antioxidant and antiglycation potential and a prominent capacity to inhibit the \u03b1-amylase enzyme. Hence, this study presents new results and stimulates further research to elucidate the biological properties of A. humile and its capacity to manage DM and its complications."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
