Owing to many environmental and geographical factors, Angelicae Sinensis Radix from various origins may have a difference in the content of ingredients, which made the confusion in the clinical practice and market. Herein, a binary chromatographic fingerprinting analysis method is developed via hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography to obtain more chemical information. Following that, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry method is furnished to simultaneously detect 17 ingredients of Angelicae Sinensis Radix gathered from six geographic zones in China. Eventually, the principal component analysis is successfully carried out to classify and differentiate the Angelicae Sinensis Radix from different origins, meanwhile the quantitative volcano plots was used to observe the changes of ingredient trends vividly. Accordingly, the proposed binary chromatography and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate statistical analysis can be utilized as a facile and reliable method for origin tracing and quality control of Angelicae Sinensis Radix."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of TCM Evaluation and Translational Research, Research Center for Traceability and Standardization of TCMs, Cellular and Molecular Biology Center.
