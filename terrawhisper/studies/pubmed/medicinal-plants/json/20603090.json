Coexistent phytochemicals, or those present in high levels, in the 3 most promising Chinese herbs were tested for their anti-lipase activity.", "Extracts from 2 herbs, Prunella vulgaris L. (Labiatae) and Rheum palmatum L. (Polygonaceae), at a concentration of 200 mg/mL, significantly inhibited PPL-by 74.7% and 53.8%, respectively. Quercetin exhibited better activity (27.4%) than all the other phytochemicals at a final concentration of 25 mg/mL in the assay system, followed by luteolin, with an activity of 17.3%.", "The results support the view that herbs represent a rich source of anti-lipase compounds. The screening of the methanolic extracts of 37 Chinese medicinal plants in vitro led to the identification of several extracts with potential activity against PPL, in particular, P. vulgaris and R. palmatum. We also found that several monomeric chemicals in these herbs exhibited good or moderate activity against PPL. To the best of our knowledge, these traditional Chinese herbal medicines or phytochemicals have not been previously screened for their lipase inhibitory activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier.
