We collected four medicinal herbs Cichorium pumilum, Eryngium creticum, Pistacia palaestina and Teucrium polium used in traditional Arab medicine for greenhouse cultivation to assess the effects of different fertilization regimes on their growth and antioxidant activity. Wild seedlings were collected and fertilized with either 100% Hoagland solution, 50% Hoagland solution, 20% Hoagland solution or irrigated with tap water. Plant height was measured and the number of green leaves and branches counted weekly. Thereafter, the aboveground parts of plants were harvested for preparing a water-soluble powder extracts of which antioxidant activity was measured by their ability to suppress the oxidation of beta-carotene. Of the fertilization regimes, we found either 20 or 50% Hoagland solution produced the most consistent response of the plant growth parameters. All powders prepared from the four wild growing plants inhibited oxidation of beta-carotene. Increasing the amount of fertilizer caused a significant concentration-dependent increase in antioxidant activity of the cultivated T. polium compared with the wild type. In contrast, increasing the amount of fertilizer caused a significant concentration-dependent reduction in the antioxidant activity of powders prepared from the cultivated E. creticum when compared with wild plants. Our results showed that cultivation success should not rely solely on parameters of growth but should incorporate assessment related to indices of therapeutic potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Galilee Society R&D Center (Associated with Haifa University), PO Box 437, Shefa-Amr 20200, Israel. hazaizeh@yahoo.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Azaizeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ljubuncic", "ForeName": "Predrag", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Portnaya", "ForeName": "Irina", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Said", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cogan", "ForeName": "Uri", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bomzon", "ForeName": "Arieh", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Evid Based Complement Alternat Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101215021", "ISSNLinking": "1741-427X"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Eisenberg DM, Kessler RC, Foster C, Norlock FE, Calkins DR, Delbanco TL.
