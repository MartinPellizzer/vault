With the aim to produce an inventory of the plants used by the healers to treat snakebites and to document the methods of preparation, administration, the dosage, number of patients treated throughout their years of practice with treatment results, 20 healers with experience in Bothrops, Porthidium and Bothriechis envenomations were interviewed between August, 1996 and November, 1998. They belong to nine black and three indigenous rural communities located near the towns of Bojay\u00e1, Vig\u00eda del Fuerte, Ungu\u00eda (Atrato river valley), Nuqu\u00ed and Bah\u00eda Solano (Pacific coast). Based on field interviews, 101 species of plants were identified as used to treat snakebites. The part used of each plant varies according to the species. Sixty plants are used in the form of drinks prepared by infusion, decoction or maceration; 78 as external baths on the affected extremity; 11 for steam application and 39 for poultices; the latter is used mainly when the bite is complicated by local necrosis. In mild and moderate envenomations, they generally use a mixture of three plants, while in severe cases they mix from five to 12, a handful of each one. Treatment is generally performed for 1-3 days, when the patient reacts positively. They reported to have treated 454 patients during their years of experience, 20 of them (4.4%) died. With the guidance of the healers, 77 species of plants were collected and photographed. These plants belong to 41 families, of which Piperaceae (13 species), Araceae (six species), Asteraceae (five species) and Gesneriaceae (three species) have the highest number of species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Programa de Ofidismo, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Antioquia, A.A. 1226, Medell\u00edn, Colombia. rotero@catios.udea.edu.co"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Otero", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fonnegra", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jim\u00e9nez", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "N\u00fa\u00f1ez", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alzate", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Saldarriaga", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Del Valle", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Osorio", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00edaz", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Valderrama", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Duque", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "V\u00e9lez", "ForeName": "H N", "Initials": "HN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Snake Bites"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10940589", "10.1016/s0378-8741(00)00243-9", "S0378874100002439"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
