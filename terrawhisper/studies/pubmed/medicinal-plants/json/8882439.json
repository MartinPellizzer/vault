In the symposium, which was the main scientific focus of the meeting, speakers from both developed and developing countries presented their perspectives on issues regarding intellectual property rights in regard to drug development from natural sources, conservation of natural habitats, and international conventions on bioprospecting. Careful evaluation of existing policies, laws, and conventions; sensitivity to the respective world views of prospective partners; equitable sharing of benefits including scientific collaboration; and a sense of fairness will be necessary to ensure that the genetic resources of all countries will be developed for the benefit of humankind."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, University of Illinois at Chicago 60612, USA."}], "LastName": "Gyllenhaal", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McChesney", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Congress"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intellectual Property"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8882439", "10.1021/np960196+", "np960196+"]}}]}
