This results in the activation of the inactive oxidized enzyme, while activation by light in vivo is thought to occur via reduction of an intrasubunit disulfide bridge. After proteolytic activation the oxidized enzyme had a specific activity of 100 U/mg protein, which is 50% of the maximal activity of the control enzyme in the reduced state. When the truncated enzyme was reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT), the specific activity was further increased to 1200 U/mg. While the native enzyme is composed of four identical subunits of 38,900 Da, the truncated malate dehydrogenase forms dimers composed of two subunits of 38,000 Da. No further change of molecular mass or activity was noticed subsequent to prolonged incubation of native NADP-malate dehydrogenase with carboxypeptidase Y for several days. When the enzyme is denatured by 2 M guanidine-HCl, the proteolytic activation proceeds more rapidly, but only transiently. The truncated enzyme is less accessible to activation by reduced thioredoxin, but the stimulation of activity by DTT alone is more rapid than that of the native enzyme. These results indicate that only a small carboxy-terminal peptide of native NADP-malate dehydrogenase from pea chloroplasts is accessible to proteolytic degradation and that this peptide is involved in the regulation of activity, tetramer formation, and thioredoxin binding. While the pH optimum for catalytic activity of the intact reduced enzyme is at pH 8.0-8.5, it is shifted to more acidic values upon proteolysis of NADP-malate dehydrogenase. At pH values below 8 the reduced truncated enzyme exhibits substrate inhibition by oxaloacetate."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Lehrstuhl Pflanzenphysiologie, Universit\u00e4t Bayreuth, West Germany."}], "LastName": "Fickenscher", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scheibe", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxaloacetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.37", "NameOfSubstance": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.40", "NameOfSubstance": "malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Carboxypeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.16.5", "NameOfSubstance": "serine carboxypeptidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JU58VJ6Y3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Guanidine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "T8ID5YZU6Y", "NameOfSubstance": "Dithiothreitol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carboxypeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Catalysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dithiothreitol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guanidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Guanidines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Macromolecular Substances"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Malate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxaloacetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Denaturation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3341764", "10.1016/0003-9861(88)90507-3", "0003-9861(88)90507-3"]}}]}
