Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) is being employed to cultivation and production in China. However, few studies have reported the chemical composition and anti-inflammatory activity of Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) leaf essential oil (E. globulus leaf EO) extracted from Eucalyptus globulus.", "This study aimed to assess the composition of E. globulus leaf EO and identify its bacteriostatic action as well as anti-inflammatory activity. Importantly, we evaluated the effect of E. globulus leaf EO on neurological impairment and neuroinflammation in experimental stroke mice.", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) analyses was employed to evaluate the chemical components of E. globulus leaf EO, and the relative content of each component was determined by area normalization method. The antimicrobial activity of E. globulus leaf EO was determined by Oxford cup method and microbroth dilution assay. Cytotoxic activity of E. globulus leaf EO on THP-1\u00a0cells or BV2 cells in vitro was determined by CCK8 assay. In addition, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ATP-induced inflammation model in THP-1\u00a0cells or BV2 cells were established, and the relative expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1and IL-6 were confirmed by RT-PCR. Furthermore, the expression of protein GSDMD, IL-l\u03b2, NLRP3 and NF\u03baB signaling pathway were assessed by immunoblotting. In vivo,the experimental stroke model constructed by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice was employed and subsequently treated with E. globulus leaf EO (50,100\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneous injection) for 3 days to assess neurological impairment and neuroinflammation. Behavioral and neuronal damage were assessed using grip strength test, rod trarod test, and Nissl staining. Pro-inflammatory factors in serum or ischemic brain tissue was detected by ELISA kits.", "GC-MS analyses revealed that the major compound in E. globulus leaf EO was eudesmol (71.967%). E. globulus leaf EO has antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive bacteria, MIC\u00a0=\u00a00.0625\u00a0mg/mL), Escherichia coli (gram negative bacteria, MIC\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mg/mL), and Candida albicans (MIC\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0mg/mL). E. globulus leaf EO (0.5312, 1.0625, and 2.15\u00a0mg/mL) significantly decreased the expression of inflammation-related genes, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and IL-6. Furthermore, reduced levels of TLR4, Myd88, phosphorylated NF-\u03baB P65, and I\u03baB\u03b1 were found in the E. globulus leaf EO group for BV2 cells (1.025, and 2.125\u00a0mg/mL). In addition, the expression levels of GSDMD, NLRP3, IL-1\u03b2 and AIM2 were significantly decreased in the E. globulus leaf EO group when compared with the LPS -stimulated group, regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. In vivo, E. globulus leaf EO improved neurological functional deficits, inhibited excessive activation of microglia, and reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 in the ischemic tissue and serum after MCAO/R.", "E. globulus leaf EO has strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity, which has been implicated in blocking GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Moreover, E. globulus leaf EO could exert neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
