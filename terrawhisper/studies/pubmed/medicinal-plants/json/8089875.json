In house to house survey, 420 residents were interviewed in their homes by a structured questionnaire (with a response rate of 83.3%) and a complete set of data was collected for 360 Atayal and Saisiat Aborigines. The survey only included adults (N = 302), as the number of children were few. The life-time prevalence rate of smoking, drinking and betel quid chewing was 71.1%, 85.5%, 49.7% in men and 25.2%, 58.0%, 6.3% in women, respectively. In contrast, the one year prevalence rates were 61.0%, 65.4%, 27.0% in men and 16.8%, 25.97%, 1.4% in women, respectively. The result of multiple logistic regression were that (1) the male drinker and betel quid chewer was the highest risk group for smoking; (2) the male smoker was the highest risk group for drinking and (3) the married male smoker was the highest risk group for betel quid chewer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aboriginal Health Laboratory, School of Public Health, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hsieh", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Gaoxiong Yi Xue Ke Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8603880", "ISSNLinking": "0257-5655"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Drinking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mastication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Racial Groups"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Substance-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8089875"]}}]}
