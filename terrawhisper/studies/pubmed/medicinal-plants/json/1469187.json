Blood and urine samples were collected over a 98 h period for monitoring the efficacy and adequacy of FAB treatment. DGTX concentrations were determined after protein precipitation (release of FAB-bound and protein-bound DGTX) in unprocessed serum and urine samples, and after aliquots of these samples had been dialysed in vitro against DGTX-free buffer (elimination of DGTX not bound to FAB). The difference in DGTX concentration between the unprocessed and dialysed samples was the amount of DGTX bound to plasma proteins and the small fraction of unbound DGTX being relevant for the therapeutic and toxic effects of the drug. Before FAB therapy was started, the total serum DGTX concentration was 535 nmol/l. The first FAB infusion (320 mg) was started 11 h after drug ingestion. Since this amount of FAB was insufficient to bind all DGTX present in the serum, cardiac DGTX toxicity (total AV-block) persisted. During a second FAB infusion (400 mg) the patient reverted to regular AV-conduction. At this time most of the DGTX in serum was FAB-bound. Toxic symptoms (sinus arrest) reappeared twice and were accompanied by increasing amounts of non-antibody-bound DGTX in the serum. Additional application of FAB (2 x 80 mg) resulted in the immediate disappearance of arrhythmia. During FAB-treatment total DGTX serum concentrations and renal DGTX clearance rose, indicating redistribution of drug from tissue to serum and urinary elimination of FAB-bound DGTX, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinic for Internal Medicine, Medical University of L\u00fcbeck, FRG."}], "LastName": "Kurowski", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Iven", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Djonlagic", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Case Reports", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Intensive Care Med", "NlmUniqueID": "7704851", "ISSNLinking": "0342-4642"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "E90NZP2L9U", "NameOfSubstance": "Digitoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "poisoning", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Digitoxin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infusions, Intravenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolic Clearance Rate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Suicide, Attempted"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 1986;30(5):527-33", "ArticleIdList": ["3758140"]}, {"Citation": "Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss. 1980 Dec;73(12):1471-8", "ArticleIdList": ["6779736"]}, {"Citation": "Clin Chem. 1987 Sep;33(9):1652-5", "ArticleIdList": ["3621567"]}, {"Citation": "N Engl J Med. 1982 Nov 25;307(22):1357-62", "ArticleIdList": ["6752715"]}, {"Citation": "Acta Cardiol. 1984;39(4):301-5", "ArticleIdList": ["6333127"]}, {"Citation": "Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1987 Dec 12;295(6612):1520-1", "ArticleIdList": ["3122885"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Clin Invest. 1980 Apr;10(2 Pt 1):93-7", "ArticleIdList": ["6780367"]}, {"Citation": "Eur J Clin Invest. 1983 Apr;13(2):159-63", "ArticleIdList": ["6409639"]}, {"Citation": "J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1982 Oct;19(8):857-60", "ArticleIdList": ["7182514"]}, {"Citation": "Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1989 Sep;28(3):352-6", "ArticleIdList": ["2789929"]}, {"Citation": "J Toxicol Clin Toxicol. 1985;23(4-6):327-40", "ArticleIdList": ["4057323"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1469187", "10.1007/BF01694351"]}}]}
