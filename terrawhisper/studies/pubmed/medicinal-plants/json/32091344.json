Suaeda plants can biosynthesize natural substances with powerful antioxidant activity and are considered as a renewable source of energy, food, and edible oil for a larger number of populations living in the harsh environment with high salinity and drought conditions. These plants also meet folk and alternative medicines' needs.", "The review encompasses available scientific literature related to folk medicinal uses of Suaeda plants, their nutritional values, and chemical constituents. In addition, the biological trials applied for the Suaeda plants are also part of the review. The review covers the researches from major science literature search engines and other sites representing scientific literature, i.e., Scifinder, Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google. The searches were programmed on the advance options available in the search engines and are latest up to November 2019. The searches were exhaustive and rechecked for accuracy.", "The study summarizes the uses of Suaeda plants as a remedy for various ailments due to their contents from the polyphenols and flavonoids.
