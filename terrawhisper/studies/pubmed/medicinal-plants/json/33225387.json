There are many approaches to the discovery of novel agents for the treatment of depressive- and anxiety-like symptoms. However, the efficacy of existing drugs for emotional disorders is only exerted after a few weeks of treatment and have serious side effects. Due to this, new strategies to find suitable and safe options are being sought by many researchers. Among them, a lot of interest has been attracted by plant-derived natural compounds due to their wide range of beneficial effects for new agent development. Flavonoids are natural polyphenol-like compounds found commonly in plants, fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs. A diverse range of flavonoids have been studied to investigate their potential therapeutic activities for the treatment of brain-associated disorders, including anxiety and depression. The main aim of this review is to understand the associations between the various flavonoids and the emotional disorders and discuss the therapeutic effects of these natural compounds that were demonstrated during the conduction of recent studies. The current work shows advances in the latest research of some flavonoids as a potential candidate for the treatment of emotional disorders. We summarize their behavioral, molecular, physiological, and neurochemical effects in various in vitro and in vivo models. Therefore, in the present work, the latest studies were collected on the most important flavonoid compounds and their underlying mechanisms of action in emotion-related disorders were discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Ko", "ForeName": "Yong-Hyun", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Seon-Kyung", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seok-Yong", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, Republic of Korea. jang@skku.edu."}], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "Choon-Gon", "Initials": "CG"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "NRF-2020R1F1A1072302", "Agency": "National Research Foundation of South Korea", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Affect"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Brain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "metabolism", "physiopathology", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Emotions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacokinetics", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "8", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33225387", "10.1007/s12272-020-01292-5", "10.1007/s12272-020-01292-5"]}}]}
