To open the way for the production of a standardized herbal remedy, we compared the activity of the traditional preparation with laboratory preparations.", "People were interviewed on their mode of use and preparation of what is considered the best remedy against fevers in this area. The herbal remedy was prepared according to the healer's recommendations. The plant was also submitted to continuous distillation and percolation extraction. The preparations were then tested against Plasmodium falciparum, in vitro. Traditional preparation and extract obtained by percolation were tested on Plasmodium berghei infected mice. Chemical profiles were also explored by thin-layer chromatography.", "Yields of extraction were around 7% in the preparations (percolation was the most efficient). The phytochemical profile showed a mix of steroids, flavonoids and alkaloids qualitatively similar in all preparations. In vitro, the extracts showed inhibitory concentration 50 <10\u03bcg/mL: the traditional preparation was almost three times less active than laboratory preparations. In vivo, percolation was also more active than traditional preparation, inhibiting 78% of the parasite growth at 400mg/kg/day by oral route.", "Pharmacological activities suggest that both the original remedy (prepared according to traditional pharmacopeia) and the extracts obtained by percolation extraction exhibit relevant antiparasitic activity. C. toxicofera should therefore be considered for the elaboration of an improved traditional medicine by implementing toxicological studies and carefully following quality control guidelines for its preparation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogot\u00e1, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Farmacia, FaMeTra research group (traditional and Popular medicine Pharmacology), Colombia."}], "LastName": "Rodriguez", "ForeName": "Zully Johana", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogot\u00e1, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Farmacia, FaMeTra research group (traditional and Popular medicine Pharmacology), Colombia."}], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez", "ForeName": "Yinneth Victoria", "Initials": "YV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Uitoto representative, Km 7 Via Leticia Tarapaca, Comunidad Ciudad Hitoma, Leticia, Colombia."}], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "Jos\u00e9 Octavio", "Initials": "JO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogot\u00e1, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Farmacia, FaMeTra research group (traditional and Popular medicine Pharmacology), Colombia."}], "LastName": "Arias", "ForeName": "Mar\u00eda Helena", "Initials": "MH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institut de Recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement, IRD Repr\u00e9sentation Ban Naxay, Saysettha District., Vientiane, Lao PDR."}], "LastName": "Deharo", "ForeName": "Eric", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Bogot\u00e1, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Farmacia, FaMeTra research group (traditional and Popular medicine Pharmacology), Colombia."}], "LastName": "Garavito", "ForeName": "Giovanny", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Vector Borne Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101212761", "ISSNLinking": "0972-9062"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colombia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Menispermaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium berghei"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}], "CoiStatement": "None"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34290162", "10.4103/0972-9062.310868", "JVectorBorneDis_2020_57_2_170_310868"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
