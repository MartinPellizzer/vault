The genetic diversity of 21 species of R. glutinosa were analyzed by SRAP molecular markers, and the catalpol and verbascoside was determined by HPLC. The mass fraction of catalpol and verbascoside in R. glutinosa germplasm were respectively in the range of 2.393%-6.519% and 0.063%-0.478%, the germplasm 14, 16, 15 and 20 germplasm, witch catalpol and verbascoside content was higher. A total of 57 bands were produced by 10 primer, among which 40 polymorphic bands were polymorphic bands, and the percentage of polymorphic loci was 8.77%-54.39%, the Nei's genetic diversity index (H) was 0.374 1, Shannon's polymorphism information index (I) was 0.546 6. Gst and gene flow Nm were 0.608 8 and 0.321 3, respectively. Based on the genetic uniformity, 21 species of germplasm were grouped into 2 categories. The genetic diversity level of R. glutinosa was medium low. The comprehensive consideration of the genetic diversity and the content inculde catalpol and verbascoside, germplasm 7 and germplasm 18 could be used as the preferred materials for the cultivation of reticulum. Germplasm 15 and 16 can be used as the preservation and breeding object of rhubarb germplasm."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Hai-Xia", "Initials": "HX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Cheng-Hong", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Wei-Ke", "Initials": "WK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chang-Gui", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infinitus (China) Co., Ltd., Guangzhou 510663, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Chinese Medicine Resource Center, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bo", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guiyang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guiyang 550002, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Cheng-Gang", "Initials": "CG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Flow"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30583619", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180726.008"]}}]}
