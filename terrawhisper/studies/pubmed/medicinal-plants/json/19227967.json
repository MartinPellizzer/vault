As the gardens grew in size, they evolved from herb gardens to botanic gardens with small herbaria for the supply of medical herbs. They were intended for the instruction of medical, surgical and apothecary students and, in the case of the physicians, to demonstrate the need for a physicians' college and a pharmacopoeia. Some of the doctors in charge of them were equally famous and influential in botany as in medicine, and while Edinburgh Town Council enjoyed the fame the gardens brought to the city it was parsimonious and slow to support its botanical pioneers. The gardens are celebrated today in the Sibbald Garden within the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "derekdoyle@waitrose.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Doyle", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Historical Article", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J R Coll Physicians Edinb", "NlmUniqueID": "101144324", "ISSNLinking": "1478-2715"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["history", "organization & administration", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Gardening"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "General Surgery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 16th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 17th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 18th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 19th Century"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "History, 20th Century"}, {"QualifierName": ["history"], "DescriptorName": "Physicians"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scotland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19227967"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
