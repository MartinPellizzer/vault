However, the growing demand for MPs and the concerns regarding their quality and sustainability have prompted the reassessment of conventional production practices. Controlled environment cropping systems, such as vertical farms, offer a transformative approach to MP production. By enabling precise control over environment factors, such as light, carbon dioxide, temperature, humidity, nutrients, and airflow, controlled environments can improve the consistency, concentration, and yield of bioactive phytochemicals in MPs. This review explores the potential of controlled environment systems for enhancing MP production. First, we describe how controlled environments can overcome the limitations of conventional production in improving the quality of MP. Next, we propose strategies based on plant physiology to manipulate environment conditions for enhancing the levels of bioactive compounds in plants. These strategies include improving photosynthetic carbon assimilation, light spectrum signalling, purposeful stress elicitation, and chronoculture. We describe the underlying mechanisms and practical applications of these strategies. Finally, we highlight the major knowledge gaps and challenges that limit the application of controlled environments, and discuss future research directions."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
