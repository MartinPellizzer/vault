There were no differences between the groups with regard to intake of drugs metabolized by polymorphic CYPs or drug or herbal products inhibiting CYPs. The prevalence of CYP2D6*4 alleles among the OLPs was higher [28%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 20-36%] than previously reported among Danes (19%; 95% CI 17-22%). Fifty per cent of the OLPs had a CYP2D6*4 genotype as compared with 30% in the background population (P = 0.0001). The CYP2D6*4 protein has sequence homology with human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and Candida albicans, which may result in molecular mimicry.", "It was not possible to substantiate a pharmacological pathogenesis of OLP based on poor or intermediate CYP metabolism. However, molecular mimicry between CYP2D6, in particular CYP2D6*4, and common oral pathogens may be involved in the pathogenesis of OLP."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Section of Oral Medicine, Clinical Oral Physiology, Oral Pathology & Anatomy, Department of Odontology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. ckr@odont.ku.dk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kragelund", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hansen", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Reibel", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nauntofte", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Broesen", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedersen", "ForeName": "A M L", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smidt", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eiberg", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Torpet", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "J Oral Pathol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8911934", "ISSNLinking": "0904-2512"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9035-51-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP2C9 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "CYP2C19 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.14.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Case-Control Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cohort Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Lichen Planus, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Mimicry"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19192051", "10.1111/j.1600-0714.2008.00702.x", "JOP702"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
