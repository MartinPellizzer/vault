(common name brahmi) is a traditional and renowned Indian medicinal plant with high commercial value for its memory revitalizer potential. Demand for this herb has further escalated due to popularization of various brahmi-based drugs coupled with reported anticancer property. Insufficient seed availability and problems associated with seed propagation including short seed viability are the major constraints of seed conservation in the gene banks. In vitro clonal propagation, a prerequisite for in vitro conservation by enhanced axillary branching was standardized. We have developed a simple, single step protocol for in vitro establishment, propagation and medium-term conservation of B. monnieri. Single node explants, cultured on Murashige and Skoog's medium supplemented with BA (0.2 mg/L), exhibited shoot proliferation without callus formation. Rooting was achieved on the same medium. The in vitro raised plants were successfully transferred to soil with ~80 % survival. On the same medium, shoots could also be conserved for 12 months with high survival and genetic stability was maintained as revealed by molecular markers. The protocol optimized in the present study has been applied for culture establishment, shoot multiplication and medium-term conservation of several Bacopa germplasm, procured from different agro-ecological regions of India."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tissue Culture and Cryopreservation Unit, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), Pusa Campus, New Delhi, 110012, India. neelam.sharma1@icar.gov.in."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Neelam", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Genomic Resources, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), Pusa Campus, New Delhi, 110012, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Rakesh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tissue Culture and Cryopreservation Unit, ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), Pusa Campus, New Delhi, 110012, India."}], "LastName": "Pandey", "ForeName": "Ruchira", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Methods Mol Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9214969", "ISSNLinking": "1064-3745"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acclimatization"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacopa"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "growth & development", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27108316", "10.1007/978-1-4939-3332-7_11"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
