Paw swelling of adjuvant arthritis rats measured at various times after CFA injection. Over 15 days of RA induction, mediator/cytokine-mediated processes involved in managing the regulation and resolving RA's inflammation were also quantified with ELISA. Histopathological changes were also assessed under a microscope 15 days after the CFA injection. AUR at all doses and UMB administration only at a 16\u00a0mM /kg administration dose significantly reduced CFA-induced paw edema level compared to the control group. UMB (64 and 32\u00a0mM) and AUR (64, 32, and 16\u00a0mM) could reduce the PGE2 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001-.01) and NO (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001-.05) levels in the treatment groups compared to the negative control group. However, these compounds showed no significant effect on the TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, TGF-\u03b2, IL-4, and IL-10 levels than the control group (p\u00a0>\u00a0.05). Unlike indomethacin and prednisolone, treatment of rats with AUR (16, 32, and 64\u00a0mM/kg) and UMB (16 and 32\u00a0mM/kg) reduced the level of IL-2 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). In all treatment groups, the serum level of IL-17 was significantly reduced compared to the CFA group (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001-0.05). We suggested AUR and UMB could diminish inflammation by reducing the serum level of IL-17 and could be considered a proper alternative in the treatment of IL-17 related inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Given that AUR and UMB apply their anti-inflammatory effects by changing distinct cytokine release/inhibition patterns, their potential application in diverse inflammatory diseases seems different."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
