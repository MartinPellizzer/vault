Their structures were identified by spectral methods, and the absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by ECD calculation and single crystal X-ray diffraction, respectively. Compound 1 represents the first example of C-17 norcassane indole-diterpenes. All the isolates were screened for antiproliferative activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines using the MTT assay, and 1 showed significant cytotoxicity against HEL cells (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a03.2\u00a0\u03bcM). Simple mechanistic study revealed that 1 could induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis in HEL cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
