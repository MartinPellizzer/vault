Ventricular tachycardia was induced in nine conscious dogs with chronic complete atrioventricular block by administering digoxin i.v. 0.1 mg/kg given in 1-1 1/2 hour. Spontaneous ventricular tachycardia most frequently had a right bundle branch block morphology and an extreme left axis suggesting an origin in the apex of the left ventricle. Less frequently, a left bundle branch block-like configuration with an intermediate axis was observed, compatible with an origin in the basal part of the right ventricle. Following pacing close to one of these predilection sites, the first post-pacing QRS morphology suggested an origin close to the site of stimulation. Pacing distant from these predilection sites resulted in fusion complexes between electrical activation from these predilection sites and the stimulation site. The amount of fusion depended on interstimulus interval and the number of stimuli. Long interstimulus intervals and few stimuli induced a QRS complex similar to that of the spontaneous tachycardia. The faster and longer the stimulation train, the more the QRS complex became similar to the paced QRS complex. Similar findings were also observed on decreasing the last paced interval only. Our findings suggest that triggered activity is the underlying mechanism for the first post-pacing QRS complex. QRS configuration and the relation between the R-R interval and QRS configuration during tachycardia suggest that triggered activity is also the mechanism for the spontaneously occurring ventricular tachycardia during digitalis intoxication. These observations may have important clinical implications."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gorgels", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "De Wit", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Beekman", "ForeName": "H D", "Initials": "HD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dassen", "ForeName": "W R", "Initials": "WR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wellens", "ForeName": "H J", "Initials": "HJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Pacing Clin Electrophysiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7803944", "ISSNLinking": "0147-8389"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cardiac Pacing, Artificial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dogs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrocardiography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Block"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Tachycardia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1986", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2432487", "10.1111/j.1540-8159.1986.tb06634.x"]}}]}
