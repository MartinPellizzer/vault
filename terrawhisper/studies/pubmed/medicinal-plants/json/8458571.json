Sw. complex was investigated using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs). DNA samples from four plants of each of 45 accessions within the S. guianensis species complex were analyzed using 20 oligonucleotides of random sequence. Little variation was found within each of the 18 accessions (1-7% of total RAPD bands in pairwise comparisons) and none within each of the other 27 accessions. However, higher levels of polymorphisms were observed both within (index of genetic distance = 1 - F = 0.16-0.248) and between (1 - F = 0.254-0.408) the five taxa. This level of differentiation at the DNA level supported an earlier classification of the taxa as distinct species. A phenogram based on band sharing was constructed to show genetic relationships among the taxa studied. This phenogram corroborated the description of relationships based on morphological-agronomic characteristics, seed protein patterns, rhizobial affinities, crossability, and pollen stainability of the hybrids. In this phenogram, the most similar species were S. grandiflora and S. hippocampoides (1 - F = 0.264), with S. acuminata also showing closest similarity to these two species (1 - F = 0.277 and 0.283, respectively). Stylosanthes gracilis accessions showed the closest similarity (1 - F = 0.296) to S. guianensis ssp. guianensis accessions. Lowest similarity values (1 - F = 0.335-0.411) were found between these two species and S. grandiflora, S. acuminata, and S. hippocampoides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Cunningham Laboratory, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia."}], "LastName": "Kazan", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Manners", "ForeName": "J M", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cameron", "ForeName": "D F", "Initials": "DF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Genome", "NlmUniqueID": "8704544", "ISSNLinking": "0831-2796"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Amplification"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8458571", "10.1139/g93-006"]}}]}
