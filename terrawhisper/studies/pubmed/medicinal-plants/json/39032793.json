Compounds 9\u03b1-hydroxy-3-deoxyzaluzanin C, epi-8\u03b1-angeloyloxycichoralexin, 8-O-methylsenecioylaustricin and lactucin showed strong anti-neuroinflammation activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11, 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23, 1.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 and 1.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.
