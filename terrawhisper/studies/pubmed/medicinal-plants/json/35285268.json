In July 2019, the root rot symptoms of A. capillaris were observed in its production field (approximately 1.3 hectares) iningyuan Manchu Autonomous County (41\u00ba47'28\" N, 124\u00ba21'35\" E), Fushun City in Liaoning province, China. Typical symptom included wilting, darkening, and rotting of the root collar and vascular bundle, leading to plant defoliation and death. Approximately 25% of the plants in the field showed the symptoms, with 2-year-old plants having more severe symptoms. Root tissue samples were collected from the diseased plants, surface-sterilized with 75% ethanol for 30 s, followed by 2% NaClO for 5 min, rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). After 3 days of incubation at 25 \u00b0C, white Fusarium-like colonies grew out from the symptomatic root tissue pieces. Five single-spore isolates were obtained from 10-day-old cultures using single-spore isolating technique. The fungus produced many macroconidia with the typical macroconidia of Fusarium spp. on carnation leaf agar (CLA) after 18 days of incubation at 26\u00b0C. They were falculate, slender and slightly curved, and their cells at both ends were sharp. Macroconidia had 3 to 5 septa, measuring 24.8 to 48.6 \u00d7 3.5 to 6.4 \u03bcm (n=50). Microconidia had 1 to 2 septa, elliptical, rounded tip, measuring 6.7 to 22.5 \u00d7 2.4 to 5.5 \u03bcm (n=5). Morphologically, the isolates were identified as Fusarium oxysporum (Leslie and Summerell 2006). For molecular identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and the translation elongation factor-1a (TEF-1\u03b1) of Isolate LD528-1 were amplified with the general primer ITS1/ITS4 and TEF-1\u03b1 primer EF-1/EF-2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998). The resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank (acc. nos. MW418098 and MW423622). BLASTn analysis of the ITS sequence (KU939043) and TEF sequence (MW423622) revealed 99.06% sequence identity with F. oxysporum (KU939043) and 100% with F. oxysporum (MN892354), respectively. For pathogenicity test, a pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with 22 to 28\u00b0C and 65 to 90% relative humidity. Roots of A. capillaris were dipped in a spore suspension (1\u00d7107 conidia/ml) of Isolate LD528-1 for approximately 5 min, and then planted into the pots filled with sterilized field soil. Root dipped in sterilized water served as the controls. There were five pots for the inoculation treatment and three pots for the control treatment. All treated pots were placed and maintained in the greenhouse. After 15 days, 80% of inoculated plants were infected, with the symptoms similar to those observed in the field. The plants in the control treatment did not develop any symptoms. The same fungus was re-isolated from the diseased root tissue and confirmed by morphological and molecular assays as described above. This is the first report of F. oxysporum causing root rot of gentiana scabra bunge in China. This disease can become one of most important diseases in gentiana scabra bunge in China.
