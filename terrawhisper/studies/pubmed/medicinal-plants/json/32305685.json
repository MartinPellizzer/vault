Previously, a cytochrome P450 oxygenase (CYP) CYP76B74 catalyzing 3\u2033-hydroxylation of geranylhydroquinone (GHQ) - a key intermediate of shikonin biosynthesis, was identified from cultured cells of Arnebia euchroma. However, the enzymes catalyzing oxidation of the geranyl side-chain of GHQ from L. erythrorhizon remain unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of different tissues (red roots and green leaves/stems) from L. erythrorhizon using RNA sequencing technology. Highly expressed CYP genes found in the roots were then heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and functionally screened with GHQ as the substrate. As the result, two CYPs of CYP76B subfamily catalyzing the oxidation of GHQ were characterized. CYP76B100 catalyzed the hydroxylation of the geranyl side-chain of GHQ at the C-3\u2033 position to form 3\u2033-hydroxyl geranylhydroquinone (GHQ-3\u2033-OH). The enzyme CYP76B101 carried out oxidation reaction of GHQ at the C-3\u2033 position to produce a 3\u2033-carboxylic acid derivative of GHQ (GHQ-3\u2033-COOH) as well as GHQ-3\u2033-OH. This enzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction with GHQ as the substrate is reported for the first time. This study implicates CYP76B100 and CYP76B101 as having a potential role in shikonin biosynthesis in L. erythrorhizon."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
