We aimed to investigate acute autonomic effects of RO on hemodynamic parameters of Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", "Rats were anesthetized and femoral artery and veins were cannulated. Next day, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Acute effects of RO (1.25, 2.5, or 5.0\u00a0mg/kg; iv) on BP, HR, and variability of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and pulse interval (PI) were assessed. The effects of RO were also investigated in SHR, which received atropine (2\u00a0mg/kg), propranolol (4\u00a0mg/kg), or hexamethonium (20\u00a0mg/kg) 15\u00a0min before receiving RO. Vasorelaxant effects of RO (10-10 to 10-4\u00a0M) on aortic rings of rats were also assessed.", "In Wistar rats, none of the RO doses evoked significant changes in BP, HR, and variability of SAP and PI. On the other hand, in SHR, RO elicited reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and prevented the increase in the low frequency power (LF) of the SAP spectra. Pretreatment with atropine or propranolol did not alter hypotension, but attenuated RO-induced bradycardia. Hexamethonium prevented RO-induced hypotension and bradycardia. RO exerted vasorelaxant effects on aortic rings with (Wistar and SHR) or without functional endothelium (SHR only).", "Rose oxide, a monoterpene with anti-inflammatory properties, acts as an antihypertensive molecule due to its ability to acutely promote hypotension and bradycardia in spontaneously hypertensive rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
