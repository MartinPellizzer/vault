The legume preparations were rich in intact cells filled with denaturated starch and contained retrograded amylose. Between 8% (beans) and 11% (lentils) of the total starch ingested appeared in the feces, indicating a relatively low starch digestibility. Red bean flours of two different particle sizes were similarly digested. Sixty percent of the fecal starch in the bean-fed animals and 70% in the lentil-fed group was retrograded amylose. The in vitro indigestible starch content of the flours was evaluated with three different methods that gave rather different values. The retrograded amylose fraction, measured after alkaline treatment of a dietary fiber residue obtained by enzymic digestion, was quantitatively recovered in the feces. None of the procedures gave accurate estimates of the total in vivo indigestible starch. Fecal excretion of starch in rats not treated with antibiotics indicated that the indigestible starch in lentils was less susceptible to fermentation than that in the red bean preparations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Nutrition and Food Chemistry, University of Lund, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Tovar", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bj\u00f6rck", "ForeName": "I M", "Initials": "IM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Asp", "ForeName": "N G", "Initials": "NG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fiber"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1320113", "10.1093/jn/122.7.1500"]}}]}
