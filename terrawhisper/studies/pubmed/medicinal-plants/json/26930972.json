The altitudes were located at 2500, 2000 and 1500 m, and the sowing dates were set up at autumn August 29, and Spring April 3 and April 24. The experiments were designed with split plot.", "Under the same altitude, roots and aboveground biomass of direct sowing Angelica sinensis were higher when sowing earlier. In the same sowing date, the root and aboveground biomass was the maximum at 2 000 m altitude, followed by elevation of 1 500 m. At 2 500 m altitude, Angelica sinensis root and aboveground biomass was the minimum. Sowing at 2 000 m altitude at August 29 direct sowing Angelica sinensis showed the highest biomass and yield, reaching 13 840.95 kg/hm2, significantly higher than the other treatments. Compared with transplanting Angelica sinensis in this region, the production of direct sowing Angelica sinensis was also 15. 3% higher. Angelica sinensis medicinal grade was significantly higher than the rest of the process. Angelica sinensis extract, volatile oil and ferulic acid content had reached the standard of Chinese Pharmacopoeia.", "Angelica sinensis sowed in late August at 2000 m altitude has the best yield and quality on root length, root diameter, plant height, leaf number, dry and fresh matter accumulation, followed by 1500 m altitude, and 2500 m worst. Therefore, altitude range of Angelica sinensis direct sowing cultivation area can be reduced to 1500-2000 m.", "Angelica sinensis sowed in late August, at 2000 m altitude, the indicators like root length,root diameter,plant height,leaf number,and dry and fresh matter accumulation showed the best, followed by 1500 m altitude, 2500 m worst.
