Benth. is used in ethnomedicine for the management of pain and inflammation. Anti-nociceptive activity was determined using acetic acid-induced mouse writhing model. The anti-inflammatory activity was investigated using in-vitro bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation assay and BSA-induced hind paw edema in rats. The extract (125-500 mg/kg) administered via the oral route produced a significant (p<0.005) inhibition of acetic acid-induced writhes. The percent inhibition of writhes for extract (500 mg/kg) and diclofenac (10 mg/kg) was 53.3 and 59.5% respectively. The methanol extract (10<sup>-6</sup>-1.0 \u03bcg/mL) inhibited protein denaturation with IC<sub>50</sub>values of (1.06 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> \u03bcg/mL and 2.58 \u00d7 10<sup>-3</sup> \u03bcg/mL) for extract and diclofenac respectively. Furthermore, the leaf extract (62.5 mg/kg) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited BSA-induced paw edema in rats. The methanol leaf extract of T. vogelii has anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities. These findings justify the use of the plant in traditional medicine for the management of pain and inflammation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ayanniyi", "ForeName": "Rashidat Oluwafunke", "Initials": "RO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Ojuade", "ForeName": "Fatimoh Idowu", "Initials": "FI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Olumoh-Abdul", "ForeName": "Hidayah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Drug Development, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Salawu", "ForeName": "Kayode Muritala", "Initials": "KM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Olufadi-Ahmed", "ForeName": "Haishat", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ilorin, Ilorin Kwara State, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Adebisi-Jose", "ForeName": "Gbemisola Olusayo", "Initials": "GO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27432CM55Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Meliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Serum Albumin, Bovine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30829199"]}}]}
