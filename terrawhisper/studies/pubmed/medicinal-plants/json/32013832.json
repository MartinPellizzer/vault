Mucotoxic cancer therapies such as head and neck radiotherapy and some of the chemotherapy agents may lead to oral mucositis. In addition to its economic consequences, mucositis also affects patients' quality of life. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) manuscripts, several medicaments have been suggested for the treatment of mucositis.", "Considering the public welcome for herbal medicine, the current evidence-based review study is conducted to investigate the herbal remedies which have been proposed for oral mucositis in TPM.", "At first, a comprehensive survey was done on Qanon fi al-Teb, which is the most important textbook of TPM; then the scientific name of the herbs was authenticated according to the botanical textbooks. At last, data banks including Scopus, Pubmed, Web of science and Science direct were investigated for possible relevant properties of each medicinal plant in the literature.", "In total, 30 herbs are introduced in this study. According to the registered documents, 18 herbs are reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-nociceptive and wound healing properties of which the therapeutic effect of only a few herbs including Glycyrrhiza glabra, Malva sylvestris, Morus nigra, Punica granatum, and Solanum nigrum were directly evaluated against oral mucositis on the literature.", "Despite the lack of human studies on mucositis for the other discussed herbs, their related pharmacological properties can be considered for new natural drug discovery supported by medieval and traditional experiments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal and Traditional Medicines Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasheminasab", "ForeName": "Fatemeh Sadat", "Initials": "FS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal and Traditional Medicines Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharififar", "ForeName": "Fariba", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Immunology Research Center, Ali-ebne Abitaleb Hospital, Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mehdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Herbal and Traditional Medicines Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Setayesh", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Discov Technol", "NlmUniqueID": "101157212", "ISSNLinking": "1570-1638"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Persian"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Radiotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stomatitis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32013832", "10.2174/1570163817666200203110803", "CDDT-EPUB-104157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
