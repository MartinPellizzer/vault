Limitations of the hybridoma technology as routine antibody generation method in conjunction with numerous developments in molecular biology led to the development of alternative approaches for the streamlined identification of most effective antibodies. In this regard, display selection technologies such as phage display, bacterial display, and yeast display have been widely promoted over the past three decades as ideal alternatives to traditional methods. The display of antibodies on phages is probably the most widespread of these methods, although surface display on bacteria or yeast have been employed successfully, as well. These methods using various sizes of combinatorial antibody libraries and different selection strategies possessing benefits in screening potency, generating, and isolation of high affinity antibodies with low risk of immunogenicity. Knowing the basics of each method assists in the design and retrieval process of antibodies suitable for different diseases, including cancer. In this review, we aim to outline the basics of each library construction and its display method, screening and selection steps. The advantages and disadvantages in comparison to alternative methods, and their applications in antibody engineering will be explained. Finally, we will review approved or non-approved therapeutic antibodies developed by employing these methods, which may serve as therapeutic antibodies in cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
