Lycium ruthenicum Murray (LRM) has been gaining increasing attention due to its nutritional and medicinal value, but the ELNs in LRM has not been reported. In this study, LRM-ELNs were obtained, and the proteins, lipids, microRNAs (miRNAs) and active components in LRM tissues and LRM-ELNs was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, LC-MS, high-throughput sequencing techniques, and physical and chemical analysis. LRM-ELNs can be uptaken by PC12 cells through macropinocytosis and caveolin-mediated endocytosis primarily. Transcriptomic and western blot experiments indicate that LRM-ELNs can inhibit A\u03b2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells through the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, with miRNAs playing a crucial role. These results indicated that LRM-ELNs have the protection effect on PC12 cells and can be considered as dietary supplements for alleviating neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
