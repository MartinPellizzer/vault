In recent years, the use of elicitors has opened a novel approach for the production of secondary metabolite compounds. Dracocephalum kotschyi is a valuable herb due to pharmaceutical compounds like rosmarinic acid, quercetin and apigenin. In the current study, foliar application of chitosan (0, 100, 400\u2009mg\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> ) as an elicitor was used.", "After chitosan treatment, the amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ) increased and the plant was able to increase the activities of enzymatic (guaiacol peroxidase, catalase and phenylalanine ammonium lyase) and non-enzymatic (total phenols and flavonoids) defensive metabolites. Also, foliar spray of chitosan promoted nutrient absorption which led to the accumulation of macroelements in the plant.", "Chitosan was found to be a very effective elicitor for improving rosmarinic acid and quercetin content (up to 13-fold). Also, the content of apigenin (anticancer flavonoid) showed 16-fold enhancement compared to the control. Therefore, the treatment of D. kotschyi leaves with chitosan caused a very large increase in the induction and production of important pharmaceutical compounds such as rosmarinic acid and quercetin. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahromi", "ForeName": "Samaneh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6773-1516"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khara", "ForeName": "Jalil", "Initials": "J"}], "GrantList": [{"Agency": "Urmia University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cinnamates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Depsides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "guaiacol peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Biological Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamates"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Depsides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nutrients"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secondary Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosmarinic Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Mazzei R, De Marco EV, Gallo O and Tagarelli G, Italian folk plant-based remedies to heal headache (XIX-XX century).
