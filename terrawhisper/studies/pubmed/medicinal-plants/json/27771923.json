Numerous studies have revealed several unique properties of DAS in terms of its health-promoting effects. DAS has proved to be anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory like unique functions as demonstrated by the multiple investigations. Diallyl sulfide can also impede oxidative stress and chronic inflammation as suggested by the literature. Studies also explored that DAS could thwart the development of chronic diseases like cancer, neuronal, cardiovascular disease through modulating mechanistic pathways involved in pathogenesis. In this book chapter, we have attempted to give the comprehensive view on DAS about the physiochemical and biological properties, and its preventive role in chronic diseases with a mechanistic overview."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food, Drug and Chemical Toxicology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, 31, Vish Vigyan Bhawan, M.G.
