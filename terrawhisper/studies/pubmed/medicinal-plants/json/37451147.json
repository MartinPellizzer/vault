The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 5e, 5f, and 5o suggested that their potency of anti-proliferative activities against HeLa cell lines were better than the combretastatin A-4. Compound 5e showed the higher anti-proliferative activity against PC3, K562 and HeLa in vitro with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.49\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.08\u00a0\u00b5M and 0.01\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. Further mechanism study indicated that the representative compound 5e was new class of tubulin inhibitors by EBI competition assay and tubulin polymerization assays, it is similar to colchicine. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that compound 5e apparently disrupted tubulin network in HeLa cells, and compound 5e arrested HeLa cells at the G2/M phase and induced cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking results illustrated that the hydrogen bonds of represented compounds reinforced the interactions in the pocket of colchicine binding site. Preliminary results suggested that 5e deserves further research as a promising tubulin inhibitor for the development of anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
