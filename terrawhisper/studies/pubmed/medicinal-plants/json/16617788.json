But there was no change in PT and APTL. After 14 days, in all groups treated with HLRE, TT decreased and FIB increased. As compared to the control, only the high dose had significantly changes in TT and FIB. After 21 days, as compared to the control, TT of high and middle groups decreased and FIB of high group increased visibly. PT decurtation could also be seen in all groups. There was a decrease in TT paralleling an increase of fibrinogen in our study.", "The aqueous extract of Herba Lamiophlomis Rotata orally administered in rats can increase the contents of FIB and shorten TT. The shorten of PT is found after treated with high dose for a long time.
