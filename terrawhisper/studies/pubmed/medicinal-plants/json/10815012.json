The effects of these phytochemicals on cell growth were determined by the MTT microtitre assay with 3-day continuous drug exposure. Three human cell lines were used: CEM leukaemia, SW1573 lung tumour and CCD922 normal skin fibroblasts. Four active compounds were found with IC(50) values less than 10 microg/mL in the two cancer cell lines. Oncocalyxones A and C, both 1,4-anthracenediones from Auxemma oncocalyx (Boraginaceae), showed cytotoxicity with mean IC(50) values of 0.8-2, 7-8 and 12-13 microg/mL against CEM, SW1573 and CCD922, respectively. One diterpene and one flavonoid, both from Egletes viscosa (Compositae), were also active. 12-Acetoxy-hawtriwaic acid lactone was cytotoxic with mean IC(50) values of 6, 10 and 10 microg/mL, respectively. 4,5-Dihydroxy-3,3,7, 8-tetramethoxy flavone (ternatin) was only growth-inhibitory with mean IC(50) values of 2, 1 and 10 microg/mL, respectively. These four most active compounds were examined further for their effects on DNA integrity and on DNA synthesis. All but ternatin caused substantial DNA damage and marked inhibition of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation within 24 h. This study demonstrated the antiproliferative activity of four novel phytochemicals, three of which are DNA-reactive and inhibit DNA synthesis. Further studies are warranted to evaluate these compounds for antitumour potential."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Federal University of Ceara, P.O.
