The amplitude of the PS-phase was increased after addition of electron acceptor and reached the maximum without exogenous ADP. A decrease of the PS-phase amplitude was induced by coupling and particularly by uncoupling conditions. The yield of delayed light after reduction of the electron acceptor was not equal to the initial one and was lower without ADP. CDL was restored almost completely in the presence of ADP and was not restored in the presence of CCCP after dark incubation. The PS-phase amplitude was decreased and dark restoration was increased after the addition of the magnesium ions. The changes of the amplitude and kinetics of the PS-phase under these conditions were not connected with the rate of electron transport. The results suggest that PS-decrease of CDL reflects the lowering of the electric potential of the thylakoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grigor'ev", "ForeName": "Iu S", "Initials": "IuS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Morgun", "ForeName": "V N", "Initials": "VN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gol'd", "ForeName": "V M", "Initials": "VM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gaevski\u012d", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Issledovanie svetoindutsiruemykh izmeneni\u012d millisekundnogo poslesvecheniia khloroplastov gorokha."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Russia (Federation)", "MedlineTA": "Biofizika", "NlmUniqueID": "0372666", "ISSNLinking": "0006-3029"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electron Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Methods"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7159619"]}}]}
