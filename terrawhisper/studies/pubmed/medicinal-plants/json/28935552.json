CE is one of the most important global parasitic infectious diseases, both in humans and animals. This parasite causes hydatid cysts that can be lodge at different organs of host such as liver, lung even in heart and brain which may lead to death. Presently, numerous scolicidal chemical agents have been administrated for inactivation of the hydatid cyst contents. Because of increasing resistance and adverse effects of medications include abnormalities of liver function, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache; there is a need to find alternative therapies either with the least or without side effects. Recently, there is a high tendency among researchers to evaluate and present herbal plants as alternative option due to being inexpensive, easy available, low side effects and toxicity. Till now, many efforts have been conducted on herbal extracts against protoscolices of hydatid cysts throughout the world. Therefore, the current review systematically searched the following electronic databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar on published papers according to the keywords. In addition, a comprehensive list of medicinal plants was prepared and some of these herbal plants which showed the best efficacy and promising results are discussed elaborately."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
