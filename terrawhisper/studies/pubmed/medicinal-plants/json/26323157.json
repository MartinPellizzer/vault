SIMPCA 12.0 software was used a principal component analysis PCA) and partial small squares analysis (PLSD-DA) on the twelve components in 10 batches from four pharmaceutical factories. Acquity UPLC BEH C15 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m) was adopted at the column temperature of 35 \u00b0C and eluted with acetonitrile (A) -0.05% phosphate acid solution (B) as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0. 3 mL \u00b7 min(-1). The injection volume was 1 \u00b5L. The detection wavelengths were set at 210 nm for alantolactone, isoalantolactone and oleanolic; 260 nm for trychnine and brucine; 288 nm for protopine; 306 nm for protopine, resveratrol and piperine; 370 nm for quercetin and isorhamnetin. The results showed a good separation among index components, with a good linearity relationship (R2 = 0.999 6) within the selected concentration range. The average sample recovery rates ranged between 99.44%-101.8%, with RSD between 0.37%-1.7%, indicating the method is rapid and accurate with a good repeatability and stability. The PCA and PLSD-DA analysis on the sample determination results revealed a great difference among samples from different pharmaceutical factories. The twelve components included in this study contributed significantly to the quantitative determination of intrinsic quality of Zuozhu Daxi. The UPLC established for to the quantitative determination of the twelve components can provide scientific basis for the comprehensive quality evaluation of Zuozhu Daxi."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin-hua", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun-xue", "Initials": "CX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dong", "ForeName": "Hong-jiao", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-sheng", "Initials": "CS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Xiao-hu", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tibet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26323157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
