To elucidate the mechanism of antineoplastic activity, ginsan was tested for its ability to generate LAK cells and to produce cytokines. Spleen cells became cytotoxic to a wide range of tumor cells after 5 days of culture with ginsan in a non-major histocompatibility restricted manner and the activity of ginsan was 12 times higher than that of lentinan. The generation of killer cells by rIL-2 was neutralized only in the presence of anti-IL-2, whereas by ginsan it was neutralized in the presence of anti-IL-2 as well as anti-IFN gamma, or anti-IL-1 alpha. It was confirmed that ginsan induces the expression of mRNA for IL-2, IFN gamma, IL-1 alpha, and GM-CSF. Depletion of AsGM1+ cells from spleen cells reduced the generation of LAK by rIL-2. In contrast, depletion of AsGM1+ as well as Thy1+ cells, CD4+ cells, or DC8+ cells reduced the generation of LAK cells by ginsan. The serologic phenotype of rIL-2 induced LAK cells was CD8- cells, whereas the ginsan induced LAK cells, were CD8+ cells. Ginsan synergized with rIL-2 to generate LAK cells (2.0-15 fold) and the most dramatic synergy was seen at rIL-2 concentrations below 3 U/ml. Ginsan alone inhibited pulmonary metastasis of B16-F10 melanoma cells and enhanced the inhibition of lung colonies by rIL-2. These findings demonstrate that ginsan generates LAK cells from both NK and T cells through endogeneously produced multiple cytokines. This property may contribute to its effectiveness in the immunoprevention and immunotherapy of cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunology, Korea Cancer Center Hospital, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jung", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Park", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "H Y", "Initials": "HY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "I R", "Initials": "IR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yun", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ginsan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C57BL"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Spleen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Th1 Cells"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9525101", "10.1055/s-2006-957385"]}}]}
