The effect was abolished by the i.v. injection of antisera against bovine insulin. The same doses of the ginseng fraction (10--50 mg/kg) produced an increase in the blood insulin level in alloxan diabetic mice. Normal mice loaded i.p. with glucose (2 g/kg or more) showed also such an increase. Insulin release from perfused rat pancreases was stimulated by the ginseng fraction (0.2 mg/ml), but the potency was not stronger than that of the sulfonylureas. It was demonstrated that glucose-induced insulin release was marked in the presence of the ginseng fraction. Impaired insulin responses to glucose in alloxan diabetic rats were increased by the fraction (0.5 mg/ml) to or above the control responses in normal rats. The enhanced effect was observed also in the presence of 100 microgram/ml cycloheximide. These results indicate that some ginseng fractions stimulated insulin release, especially glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic islets and thereby lowered the blood glucose level."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kimura", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waki", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chujo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hiyama", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacobiodyn", "NlmUniqueID": "7901854", "ISSNLinking": "0386-846X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insulin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Insulin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Islets of Langerhans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7026762", "10.1248/bpb1978.4.410"]}}]}
