Seedlings were hydroponically grown under constant 20 degrees C, controlled-environment conditions. Measurements of R (using the Laisk method) and photosynthesis (at 37 Pa CO(2)) were made at several irradiances (0-2,000 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1)) and temperatures (6 degrees C-30 degrees C). At 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C, substantial inhibition of R occurred at 12 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1), with maximum inhibition occurring at 100 to 200 micromol photons m(-2) s(-1). Higher irradiance had little additional effect on R at these moderate temperatures. The irradiance necessary to maximally inhibit R at 6 degrees C to 10 degrees C was lower than that at 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Moreover, although R was inhibited by low irradiance at 6 degrees C to 10 degrees C, it recovered with progressive increases in irradiance. The temperature sensitivity of R was greater in darkness than under bright light. At 30 degrees C and high irradiance, light-inhibited rates of R represented 2% of gross CO(2) uptake (v(c)), whereas photorespiratory CO(2) release was approximately 20% of v(c). If light had not inhibited leaf respiration at 30 degrees C and high irradiance, R would have represented 11% of v(c). Variations in light inhibition of R can therefore have a substantial impact on the proportion of photosynthesis that is respired. We conclude that the rate of R in the light is highly variable, being dependent on irradiance and temperature."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Environmental Biology, Research School of Biological Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra, 0200 Australian Capital Territory, Australia. oka1@york.ac.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Atkin", "ForeName": "O K", "Initials": "OK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Evans", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ball", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lambers", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pons", "ForeName": "T L", "Initials": "TL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "142M471B3J", "NameOfSubstance": "Carbon Dioxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Darkness"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Amthor JS.
