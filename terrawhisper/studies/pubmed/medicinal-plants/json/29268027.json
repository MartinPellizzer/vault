This is especially true for Africa where herbal medicines form a key component of traditional medicinal practices and there is access to a diversity of medicinal plants. Although many benefits have been derived from the use of traditional herbal medicines, many concerns are associated with their use of which herb-drug interactions have been identified to have a rising impact on patient treatment outcome. One type of pharmacokinetic interaction involves the modulation of drug metabolizing enzymes, which may result in enhanced or reduced bioavailability of co-administered drugs. Areas covered: This review highlights the current information available on drug metabolism-associated information with regards to traditional African medicines related to some of the most prevalent diseases burdening the African continent. Expert opinion: It is clear from previous studies that enzyme modulation by traditional African medicines plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics of some co-administered drugs, but more research is needed to provide detailed information on these interactions, specifically for treatment of prevalent diseases such as tuberculosis and hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5747-8214"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Pharmacen\u2122, Centre of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Sciences , North-West University , Potchefstroom , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Gouws", "ForeName": "Chrisna", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Pharmacen\u2122, Centre of Excellence for Pharmaceutical Sciences , North-West University , Potchefstroom , South Africa."}], "LastName": "Hamman", "ForeName": "Josias H", "Initials": "JH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "101228422", "ISSNLinking": "1742-5255"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29268027", "10.1080/17425255.2018.1421171"]}}]}
