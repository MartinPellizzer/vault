Curcumin or diferuloylmethane is a polyphenol obtained from the plant Curcuma longa. Curcumin is widely used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for various conditions. The role of curcumin in thyroid gland disorders has been demonstrated by its effects on various biological pathways, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferative, apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell cycle and metastasis. In this paper, we have reviewed the recent literature on curcumin applications for thyroid dysfunction, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and discussed the molecular mechanisms of these effects. This review aims to summarize the wealth of research related to the therapeutic effect of curcumin on the thyroid gland."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shakeri", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bibak", "ForeName": "Bahram", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Imam Ali Hospital, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safdari", "ForeName": "Mohammad Reza", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Keshavarzi", "ForeName": "Zakieh", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Surgical Oncology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jamialahmadi", "ForeName": "Tannaz", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Academic Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull, Hull, UK."}], "LastName": "Sathyapalan", "ForeName": "Thozhukat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biomedical Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia."}], "LastName": "Sahebkar", "ForeName": "Amirhossein", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "9440157", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8673"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "IT942ZTH98", "NameOfSubstance": "Curcumin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Curcumin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thyroid Gland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "38"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35142266", "10.2174/0929867329666220210145033", "CMC-EPUB-120805"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
