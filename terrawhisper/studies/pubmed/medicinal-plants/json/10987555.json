This increase is observed within all cell layers (L1, L2, L3) as well as at the interfaces between these layers, and it occurs in both the central and peripheral zones of the shoot apical meristem. The extra plasmodesmata are formed only transiently, from 28 to 48 h after the start of the long day, and acropetally since they are detectable in L3 4 h before they are seen in L1 and L2. These observations indicate that (i) in the Sinapis shoot apical meristem at floral transition, there is an unfolding of a single field with increased plasmodesmatal connectivity, and (ii) this event is an early effect of the arrival at this meristem of the floral stimulus of leaf origin. Since (i) the wave of increased frequency of plasmodesmata is 12 h later than the wave of increased mitotic frequency (A. Jacqmard et al. 1998, Plant cell proliferation and its regulation in growth and development, pp. 67 78; Wiley), and (ii) the increase in frequency of plasmodesmata is observed in all cell walls, including in walls not deriving from recent divisions (periclinal walls separating the cell layers), it is concluded that the extra plasmodesmata seen at floral transition do not arise in the forming cell plate during mitosis and are thus of secondary origin."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "D\u00e9partement de Biologie V\u00e9g\u00e9tale, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, Belgium. sandra.ormenese@ulg.ac.be"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ormenese", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havelange", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deltour", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bernier", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Meristem"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Mustard Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10987555", "10.1007/s004250000294", "10.1007/s004250000294"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
