The antimicrobial activity was determined by a two-fold serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against a panel of microorganisms (two bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and seven fungal strains: Penicillium melinii, Penicillium adametzi, Penicillium urticae, Penicillium notatum, Paecilomyces varioti, Mucor saturninus Hagem and Aspergillus niger). The results showed that artificial agarwood obtained by comprehensive stimulated method (formic acid plus fungal inoculation) and extended longer inducing time have better antimicrobial activity, which is similar to the result of chemical analysis. Therefore, it is a beneficial exploration to the first use of antimicrobial activity to evaluate artificial agarwood obtained by different producing methods and different culture time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Prevention and Control of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Logistics College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, PR China / Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical College, Guangdong, PR China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Zhidong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Prevention and Control of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Logistics College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Prevention and Control of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Logistics College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Dailin", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical College, Guangdong, PR China."}], "LastName": "Gao", "ForeName": "Xiaoxia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Prevention and Control of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Logistics College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yanmin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Tianjin Key Laboratory for Prevention and Control of Occupational and Environmental Hazard, Logistics College of Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin, PR China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Yu", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Thymelaeaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Wood"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31278698"]}}]}
