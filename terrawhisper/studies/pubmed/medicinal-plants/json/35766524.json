Several species of the genus <i>Spatholobus</i> are considered as medicinal and food homologous plants in various Asian countries for the treatment of menstrual pain, anemia, paralysis, arthralgia, <i>etc</i>. Regarding this genus, mounting investigations on different aspects have been conducted; however, a comprehensive review about these findings is yet to be compiled. Herein, we reviewed the up-to-date information on the botanical description, distribution, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of the <i>Spatholobus</i> species for the first time to support their development potential. Thus far, 175 phytochemicals have been isolated, and flavonoids are the predominant constituents. Furthermore, 141 compounds show the ideal characteristic behavior of a drug-like molecule. Besides, the compounds and crude extracts of this genus have been demonstrated to exert a wide range of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> bioactivities, such as antitumor activity, antioxidant activity, antiinflammatory activity, antiischemic activity, antimicrobial activity, and neuroprotective activity. Toxicity studies have revealed that <i>Spatholobus</i> species seem to have no apparent toxic effects. Even so, the need for in-depth studies to reveal the scientific connotation of the widely documented traditional actions, the structure-activity relationship of the bioactive compounds, and the systematic toxic reactions are warranted, and also to provide essential evidence for the beneficial use of <i>Spatholobus</i> plants and developing novel health care products and therapeutic drug from this genus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0669-7510"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan 610212, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, China. shijianyoude@126.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Yunlu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Healthcare-associated Infection Control Center, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Medicine, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610031, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1026-0282"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan 610072, China. shijianyoude@126.com."}], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Jianyou", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Center, Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610041, China.
