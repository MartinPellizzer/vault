Naturally occurring xanthones are found in micro-organisms and higher plants as secondary metabolites in fungi and lichens. Compounds of the family Caryophyllaceae, Guttiferae and Gentianaceae, are the most common natural source of xanthones. The structure of the xanthones nucleus, coupled with its biogenetic source, imposes that the carbons are numbered according to the biosynthetic pact. The characteristics oxygenation pattern of xanthones earlier is mixed shikimateacetate biogenesis. The major class of xanthones includes simple oxygenated, non-oxygenated, xanthonolignoids, bisxanthones, prenylated and related xanthones, miscellaneous xanthones. Their great pharmacological importance and interesting scaffolds were highly encouraged by scientists to investigate either the synthesis design or natural products for cancer treatment. Because currently used antitumor drugs possess high toxicity and low selectivity, efficacious treatment may be compromised. This review is limited to the antitumor activity of xanthones and the chemistry of xanthone core, which may help provide fundamental knowledge to the medicinal chemist for new and advanced research in drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jinnah University for Women, Karachi, 74600, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Gul", "ForeName": "Somia", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jinnah University for Women, Karachi, 74600, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Aslam", "ForeName": "Khadija", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jinnah University for Women, Karachi, 74600, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Pirzada", "ForeName": "Quratulain", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Swabi, Swabi, Anbar, 23430, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rauf", "ForeName": "Abdur", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University Institute of Diet and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khalil", "ForeName": "Anees Ahmed", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Life Sciences, Graphic Era Deemed to be University, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India."}], "LastName": "Semwal", "ForeName": "Prabhakar", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bawazeer", "ForeName": "Sami", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Ibb University, Ibb, Yemen."}], "LastName": "Al-Awthan", "ForeName": "Yahya Saleh", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Bahattab", "ForeName": "Omar Salem", "Initials": "OS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, University of Tabuk, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biochemistry Unit, Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ibb University, Ibb, Yemen."}], "LastName": "Al Duais", "ForeName": "Mohammed Ali", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Crop Science, College of Sanghuh Life Sciences, Konkuk University, Seoul, 05029, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Thiruvengadam", "ForeName": "Muthu", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "22UQU4250073DSR07", "Agency": "Umm AL-Qura University", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biological Products"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Products"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "7", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "3", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36056870", "10.2174/1568026622666220901145002", "CTMC-EPUB-126091"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
