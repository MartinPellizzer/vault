Contemporary investigations confirmed exogenous carbohydrates as biologically active. The recent study describes the characterization of oligo- and polysaccharides from medicinal herbs and evaluation of composite-dependent physiological activity of carbohydrates on human keratinocytes in vitro. Polysaccharide isolation was followed by size- and charge fractionation. Identification of monosaccharide components was performed by GLC/MS. Primary human keratinocytes (NHK) and cells of the cell line HaCaT were used for investigation of carbohydrate action on cellular proliferation (BrdU-uptake), differentiation specific enzymes (involucrin), cell viability (MTT-reduction) and cytotoxicity. Incubation of keratinocytes with a purified beta-glucan from Reed mace seeds resulted in an improved proliferation followed by an increased differentiation after contact inhibition. Fucosylated oligo- and polysaccharides of human milk and Sea weed induced involucrin expression as maker for early differentiation without an increase in proliferation. Cell viability and proliferation of keratinocytes were enhanced by an arabinogalactan of Kaki fruits. Okra fruit rhamnogalacturonans increased cell proliferation. Heart sease pectin-like polysaccharides reduced the proliferation significantly but improved the cell viability. These results led assume that the carbohydrates of traditional used herbs play a part in their efficacy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of M\u00fcnster, Institute for Pharmaceutical Biology and Phytochemistry, Glycopharmacy Research Group, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. adeters@uni-muenster.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deters", "ForeName": "Alexandra M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lengsfeld", "ForeName": "Christian", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hensel", "ForeName": "Andreas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oligosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16111846", "10.1016/j.jep.2005.06.038", "S0378-8741(05)00431-9"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
