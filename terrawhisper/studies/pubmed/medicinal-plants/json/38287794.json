However, the functions of <i>R2R3-MYB</i> genes in <i>Dendrobium nobile</i> remains largely unknown.", "Here, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of <i>D. nobile R2R3-MYB</i> genes was performed, in which phylogenic relationships, gene structures, motif composition, chromosomal locations, collinearity analysis, and <i>cis</i>-acting elements were investigated. Moreover, the expression patterns of selected <i>DnMYB</i> genes were analyzed in various tissues and under different abiotic stresses.", "In total, 125 <i>DnMYB</i> genes were identified in the <i>D. nobile</i> genome, and were subdivided into 26 groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Most genes in the same subgroup showed similar exon/intron structure and motif composition. All the <i>DnMYB</i> genes were mapped to 19 chromosomes with the co-linearity relationship. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that 8 <i>DnMYBs</i> exhibited different expression patterns in different plant tissues, and were differentially expressed in response to abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, low-temperature stress.", "This work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the <i>R2R3-MYB</i> gene family in <i>D. nobile</i>, and provides candidate genes for future research on abiotic stress in this plant."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).
