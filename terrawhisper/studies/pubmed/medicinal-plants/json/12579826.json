A reversed phase HPLC method was established to analyze the parent drug and its metabolites. The major metabolites were isolated and purified by liquid-liquid extraction, preparative TLC and HPLC, and their structures were elucidated as 6-hydroxyl securinine, 6-carbonyl securinine, 5 beta-hydroxyl securinine and 5 alpha-hydroxyl securinine by 1HNMR, 13CNMR and MS spectral analysis. An HPLC method was developed to analyze securinine and its metabolites in biofluids (bile, urine) of rat. The bile, urine and their enzymatic hydrolyzed samples of the rat i.p. administrated with (-)-securinine were determined by using this method.", "Four main metabolites of (-)-securinine in rat hepatic microsome incubation were obtained and their structures were elucidated. Metabolites from in vitro study were confirmed in biofluids (bile, urine) which were collected from rats given securinine i.p. It was suggested that 6-hydroxyl securinine was excreted in conjugated form as well by analyzing enzymatic hydrolyzed bile.", "The main metabolic pathway of (-)-securinine in vitro and in vivo is basically elucidated."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-hai", "Initials": "XH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jin-lin", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Tong-hui", "Initials": "TH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azepines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G4VS580P5E", "NameOfSubstance": "securinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Azepines"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Bile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12579826"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
