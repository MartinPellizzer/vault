Group 1 was subjected to a laparotomy (sham-operated group) whereas all other experimental groups were subjected to an occlusion of their superior mesenteric arteries for 30 minutes and a period of 20 minutes reperfusion following occlusion. Group 2 was not given any prophylactic agent during the experiment (untreated control group). GBE was administered in a dosage of 50 mg/kg (i.v.) as a prophylactic agent to Group 3 one hour prior to laparotomy whereas Group 4 was given GBE at 50 mg/kg (i.v.) just before ischemia. Group 5 was given GBE in the same dosage just before reperfusion. Immediately after reperfusion, a biopsy was taken from the ileum (10 cm proximity to ileocaecal valve) for histopathological assessment. A significant prophylactic effect of GBE was observed in Group 5 in which GBE was administered just before reperfusion."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dicle University Medical Faculty, Diyarbakir/Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Onen", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deveci", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Inal\u00f6z", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Isik", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kilinc", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Belgium", "MedlineTA": "Acta Gastroenterol Belg", "NlmUniqueID": "0414075", "ISSNLinking": "1784-3227"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Mucosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Artery, Superior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Vascular Occlusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10692767"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
