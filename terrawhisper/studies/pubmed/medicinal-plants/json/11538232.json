Control seedlings grown at ambient pressure (101 kilopascals) were provided amounts of O2 equivalent to those provided experimental seedlings at reduced pressure to factor out responses to O2 concentration and to total pressure. Respiration was assayed using washed mitochondria, and was found to respond only to O2 concentration. Regardless of total pressure, seedlings grown at 2 millimoles O2 per liter had higher state 3 respiration rates and decreased percentages of alternative respiration compared to ambient (8.4 millimoles O2 per liter) controls. In contrast, seedling growth responded to total pressure but not to O2 concentration. Seedlings were significantly larger when grown under low pressure. While low O2 (2 millimoles O2 per liter) diminished growth at ambient pressure, growth at low pressure in the same oxygen concentration was enhanced. Respiratory development and growth of mungbean seedlings under low pressure is unimpaired whether oxygen or air is used as the chamber gas, and further, low pressure can improve growth under conditions of poor aeration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27706, USA."}], "LastName": "Musgrave", "ForeName": "M E", "Initials": "ME"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gerth", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Scheld", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Strain", "ForeName": "B R", "Initials": "BR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0401224", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0889"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmosphere Exposure Chambers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atmospheric Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diffusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environment, Controlled"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen Consumption"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ann Bot. 1984 Nov;54(Suppl 3):49-63", "ArticleIdList": ["11538823"]}, {"Citation": "Ann Bot. 1984 Nov;54(Suppl 3):65-76", "ArticleIdList": ["11538824"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1979 Nov;64(5):702-5", "ArticleIdList": ["16661038"]}, {"Citation": "Plant Physiol. 1983 Jun;72(2):339-44", "ArticleIdList": ["16663003"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11538232", "PMC1054420", "10.1104/pp.86.1.19"]}}]}
