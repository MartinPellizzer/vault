Some coumarin derivatives and flavone derivatives having phenolic hydroxyl groups were incubated with the hairy roots. The coumarin derivatives and flavone derivatives almost disappeared from the culture medium in half a day. In the case of the coumarin derivatives, a 7-hydroxyl group was easily glucosylated. A methyl group at C-8 somewhat decreased the glucosylation to a hydroxyl group at C-7 of the coumarin skeleton. The 4-hydroxy coumarin derivatives were changed to acetophenone-type glucosides by incubation with the hairy roots through decarboxylation. Several flavonol derivatives were tested for glucosylation by the hairy roots. 3-Hydroxy flavone, 3.6-dihydroxyflavone and 3,7-dihydroxyflavone were glucosylated to give 3-glucosylated derivatives. Of these, 3,6-dihydroxyflavone was highly glucosylated, but not 3-hydroxyflavone or 3,7-dihydroxyflavone to the same degree. In the case of the flavones, a 3-hydroxy group could be predominantly glucosylated, and hydroxyl groups on the A and B ring of the flavones affected glucosylation by the hairy roots."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Bioresources, Hiroshima Prefectural University, Shobara, Hiroshima 727-0023, Japan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kanho", "ForeName": "Hideki", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yaoya", "ForeName": "Sayaka", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Itani", "ForeName": "Tomio", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakane", "ForeName": "Takahisa", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kawahara", "ForeName": "Nobuo", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Takase", "ForeName": "Yoichi", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Masuda", "ForeName": "Kazuo", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kuroyanagi", "ForeName": "Masanori", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biosci Biotechnol Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "9205717", "ISSNLinking": "0916-8451"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "A4VZ22K1WT", "NameOfSubstance": "coumarin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ipomoea"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15502347", "10.1271/bbb.68.2032", "JST.JSTAGE/bbb/68.2032"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
