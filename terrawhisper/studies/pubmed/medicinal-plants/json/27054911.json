The UHPLC method was validated for linearity, accuracy, repeatability, limits of detection and limits of quantification. The linearity range (r(2)\u2009> 0.99) of the seven compounds was found to be 0.5-250 \u00b5g/mL, and the limits of detection and limits of quantification for the seven compounds were found to be 0.1 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The developed UHPLC method is simple, fast, and especially suitable for quality control analysis of coumarins and aegeline from A. marmelos and commercial dietary supplements. Single quadrupole mass spectrometry was used for the identification and confirmation of coumarins and aegeline from different plant parts and dietary supplements. In addition, a novel chiral HPLC-ToF-MS method was developed for the resolution of aegeline enantiomers. By applying this chiral method, the distribution of enantiomers of aegeline from different parts of A. marmelos and aegeline-containing dietary supplements is reported for the first time."], "CopyrightInformation": "Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Avula", "ForeName": "Bharathi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Chittiboyina", "ForeName": "Amar G", "Initials": "AG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yan-Hong", "Initials": "YH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Sagi", "ForeName": "Satyanarayanaraju", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Raman", "ForeName": "Vijayasankar", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Center for Natural Products Research, Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Mississippi, University, MS, USA."}], "LastName": "Khan", "ForeName": "Ikhlas A", "Initials": "IA"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "U01 FD004246", "Acronym": "FD", "Agency": "FDA HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "1U01FD004246-04", "Acronym": "FD", "Agency": "FDA HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumarins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60T59LN3SG", "NameOfSubstance": "aegeline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aegle"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amides"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Coumarins"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stereoisomerism"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27054911", "10.1055/s-0042-103160"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
