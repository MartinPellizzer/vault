To relieve it, the boiled leaves of the bush \"payt\u00e9' (\"Tagetes neisonii') are used as a medicinal bath. Migraine, \"yaxti-wanjol chawaj' is treated with the raw, crushed roots of the herbs \"chopak pox' and \"bakte pox' together with the practice of cutting the patient with a piece of glass in the temporal region, deep enough to make him bleed. Epilepsy or \"tub tub ikal' is caused by an abuse suffered by the animal spirit which accompanies the individual, after a fight between the animal-companions or spirits which serve the forces of Good and Evil. The person with chronic crises is considered a witch. Depression or \"melotan' is fairly common. This is treated with camomile tea containing an orange and a lime leaf. \"Xiwel' or fear is one of the commonest psychosomatic disorders. The faith-healer has to return the lost spirit to its owner in a ceremony involving prayer, alcohol and the sacrifice of a fowl. Psychosis or \"jowijel' may be due to alcohol, dog bite or witch craft and has no cure. Madness \"chawaj' is caused by bewitchment during a nightmare. It is treated with the sap of \"viborana' mixed with wild beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psic\u00f3loga Clinica M\u00e9dicus Mundi-Zaragoza, San Cristobal de las Casas.
