The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a crucial intracellular organelle that is essential for numerous cellular functions, including the synthesis, folding, and modification of newly synthesized proteins, stress responsiveness, and maintainence of cellular homeostasis. mTOR-mediated upregulation of protein synthesis induces the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which induces ER stress, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Reciprocally, ER stress regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, under pathologic conditions, the cross-talk between the mTOR and UPR signaling pathways during cellular stress can critically affect cancer cell fate and may be involved in the pathogenesis and therapeutic outcome of cancer. Here, we discuss accumulating evidence showing the mechanism of action, interconnections, and molecular links between mTOR signaling and ER stress in tumorigenesis and highlights potential therapeutic implications for numerous cancers."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a92023 American Association for Cancer Research."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0081-8369"], "AffiliationInfo":
