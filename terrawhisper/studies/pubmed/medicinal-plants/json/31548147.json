One group of mice was treated with Tiaoxin Recipe by gastrogavage for 12\u202fweeks, while two other groups were given intraperitoneal injections of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or FK866 for 4\u202fweeks. Morris water maze and thioflavin S staining tests were performed to evaluate cognitive impairment and amyloid plaque deposition, respectively. Serum amyloid-\u03b21-42 (A\u03b21-42) content was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to examine the expression levels of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in cortex and hippocampus samples of the study mice.", "Compared with the normal control group, the memory and learning abilities of the APP/PS1 model group were found to be impaired (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), as shown by the increased levels of senile plaque deposition in cortex and hippocampus (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), miR-34a expression (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) and serum A\u03b21-42 content (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Treatment with Tiaoxin Recipe significantly reduced memory impairment (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) by reducing amyloid plaque accumulation in cortex and hippocampus (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), miR-34a expression (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) and serum A\u03b21-42 content (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) in APP/PS1 mice.", "Tiaoxin Recipe is a viable complementary or alternative therapeutic treatment that is capable of delaying the development of early-stage AD by inhibiting the expression of miR-34a."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Shanghai Changhai Hospital.
