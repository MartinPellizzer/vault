And the expression pattern of the gene was also analyzed by quantitative PCR. The full length cDNA of DoHT1 was 1 586 bp in length, containing a 1 536 bp ORF, which encoded a 511-aa protein with molecular weight of 56.18 kD and isoelectric point of 9.08. The deduced DoHT1 protein had the major facilitator superfamily conserved domain (22-483), SUGAR\u208bTRANSPORT\u208b1 (139-164), and SUGAR\u208bTRANSPORT\u208b2 (338-355), typical for sugar transporter; DoHT1, without a single peptide had 11 transmembrane regions, and was predicted to locate in the plasma membrane; DoHT1 had high identities (54.7%-80.7%) with HTs proteins from various plants. DoHT1 belonged to the MST (monosaccharide transporter) group of the evolutionary tree, and was closely related to the Phalaenopsis equestris. DoHT1 was differentially expressed in the three included organs. The transcripts were significantly the most abundant in the leaves with 19.36 fold than roots, then 1.82 fold in the stems than the roots. The identification and molecular characterization of the full length DoHT1 will be essential for further function study of the gene during the regulation of sugar metabolism of D. officinale."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yi-Min", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ying", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "A-Ping", "Initials": "AP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Na", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}], "LastName": "Hei", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bin", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory for Chinese Medicine Basis & New Drugs Research,College of Pharmacy\uff0c Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang 712046, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Gang", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Shun-Xing", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharide Transport Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Complementary"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrobium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharide Transport Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29676118", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180110.003"]}}]}
