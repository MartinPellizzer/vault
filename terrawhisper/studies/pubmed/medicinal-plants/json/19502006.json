Despite advances in elucidating its pathophysiology, severe sepsis remains a leading cause of death in the critically ill. Polyphenols are a family of chemicals found in food and beverages derived from plants, such as cocoa, green tea, turmeric, and soya, as well as in medicinal herbs. These phytochemicals exhibit anti-inflammatory and vasculoprotective properties in clinical and preclinical studies. The oral or systemic administration of polyphenols protects rodents from endotoxinemia and microbial sepsis. Under these circumstances, polyphenols reproducibly attenuate microvascular hyperpermeability, tissue infiltration by leukocytes, oxidative and nitrosative stress, tissue injury, organ dysfunction, shock and vasoplegia, lactate production, and mortality. Importantly, efficacy is maintained in some cases even when treatment is initiated hours after the onset of sepsis. The inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activation and subsequent expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, adhesion molecules, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha by polyphenols is operative in ameliorating the sequelae of sepsis. Enhancement of the endogenous antioxidant capacity probably also contributes to the effectiveness of the polyphenols. Because several of the polyphenols reviewed in this article appear to be safe and to exert anti-inflammatory effects in humans, clinical trials assessing their efficacy in the critically ill are indicated. Whether delivered alone or in combination with nutritional formulas, polyphenols may help to prevent and treat sepsis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute for Nutrition Research, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shapiro", "ForeName": "Haim", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lev", "ForeName": "Shaul", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cohen", "ForeName": "Jonathan", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Singer", "ForeName": "Pierre", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutrition", "NlmUniqueID": "8802712", "ISSNLinking": "0899-9007"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyphenols"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Critical Illness"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polyphenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sepsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Shock, Septic"}], "NumberOfReferences": "106"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "26"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19502006", "10.1016/j.nut.2009.02.010", "S0899-9007(09)00132-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
