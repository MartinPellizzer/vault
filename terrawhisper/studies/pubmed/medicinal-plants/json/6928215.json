The chemical has been known for years as the toxic principle left in the cottonseed cake after cottonseed oil extraction. It is also present in the cold pressed cottonseed oil from which it may be removed through reactions with alkali. Extremely low birthrates in China's Hebeth province were traced to the use of crude cotton seed oil for cooking purposes. After prolonged investigation, it was determined that male infertility was related to the gossypol content of the oil. After a short period of animal studies, the Chinese in 1972 undertook widespread clinical trials of gossypol as a contraceptive agent. Over 4000 men have undergone treatment with the drug, some for as long as 4 years. Infertility resulted after 2 months of a daily dose of 20 mg and then the participants were maintained on 150-220 mg/month in divided doses. The drug apparently did not decrease libido in most test subjects and had not been reported to impair potency. Semen analysis at various intervals showed a decrease in motile sperm, malformed spermatozoa, and then a decrease in sperm count, leading to azoospermia. On discontinuation of the substance, the antifertility effect completely reversed itself within 3 months. No obvious toxic effects of pathological changes were observed in human and animal studies. Levels of luteinizing hormone and testosterone were unchanged and apparently indicated that gossypol does not affect hormonal balances. Adverse reactions reported to date include transient and reversible weakness in 10% of the test subjects on initiation of therapy. In addition, appetite changes, gastric discomfort, and nausea have been noted. A few cases of slight EKG changes and disturbances in potassium metabolism have occurred. No chromosomal changes have been observed nor have tests shown any mutagenic effects of the drug. In conclusion, preliminary data indicated that gossypol may offer an excellent new approach to contraception. Further testing is required to elucidate the drug's mechanism of action and to determine its adverse and possible toxic effects."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["802462", "00081291"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL SOCIETY OF NEW JERSEY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Male", "Contraceptive Methods--side effects", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Hormones", "Infertility", "Medicine", "Nausea", "Oral Contraceptives--side effects", "Plants, Medicinal", "Semen"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "6928215", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "04", "Day": "23"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0025-7524", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "77", "Issue": "1", "PubDate": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "Jan"}}, "Title": "The Journal of the Medical Society of New Jersey", "ISOAbbreviation": "J Med Soc N J"}, "ArticleTitle": "Gossypol as an oral contraceptive for men.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "50", "MedlinePgn": "50"}, "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Med Soc N J", "NlmUniqueID": "7503084", "ISSNLinking": "0025-7524"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KAV15B369O", "NameOfSubstance": "Gossypol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gossypol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1980", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6928215"]}}]}
