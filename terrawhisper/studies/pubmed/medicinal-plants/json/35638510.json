Merr., also known as coriander, is a shrub that grows wild in tropical Asia but is also cultivated as a vegetable in some countries. Determining the agronomic characteristics of 8 varieties of Bodhi tree, thereby seeing the genetic relationship between them, proposing a breeding strategy and effectively exploiting this genetic resource. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Samples of grouper varieties were planted in eight provinces in Mekong Delta. Each seed sample was collected and measured the agronomic and morphological indicators were on 6 sample plants. Tree morphology observation and description based on improved plant research methods. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The genetic relationships of 8 samples/cultivars based on the ITS sequence showed that samples of Vinh Long and Thuan Hung, Soc Trang were in the same group, samples of Hau Giang and Dong Thap in the second group, the remaining Kien Giang, Ca Mau, Can Tho and Chau Thanh and Soc Trang belong to each group. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Samples/cultivars collected from eight provinces in the Mekong Delta showed variation in agronomic characteristics, but only stem height and length changes were statistically significantly different."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Duong", "ForeName": "Thieu", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Mai", "ForeName": "Do", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Trong Ngon", "ForeName": "Truong", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Van Hung", "ForeName": "Mai", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Biol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101247723", "ISSNLinking": "1028-8880"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Breeding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vietnam"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "15", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35638510", "10.3923/pjbs.2022.401.405"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
