The health properties of these natural chemicals are widely accepted, and efforts are underway to extract the specific components referred to as flavonoids. Flavonoids demonstrate a diverse range of bio-activities, anticancer, antioxidant activity, anti-cholinesterase activity, antiinflammatory activity, antimalarial activity, antidiabetic activity, neurodegenerative disease, cardiovascular effect, hepatoprotective effects, and antiviral and antimicrobial activity. This study aims to examine the prevailing trends in flavonoid investigation studies, elucidate the activity of flavonoids, examine their various func-tions and uses, assess the potential of flavonoids as preventive medications for chronic diseases, and outline future research opportunities in this field. This review explores the diverse functions of flavonoids in preventing and managing various diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0009-0004-7486-372X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, GLA University, NH#2 Delhi Mathura Highway, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Bhoopendra", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4351-6587"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, GLA University, NH#2 Delhi Mathura Highway, India."}], "LastName": "Semwal", "ForeName": "Bhupesh Chander", "Initials": "BC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Top Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101119673", "ISSNLinking": "1568-0266"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "7", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39108008", "10.2174/0115680266316032240718050055", "CTMC-EPUB-142075"]}}]}
