Several models of nociception have been used to examine the analgesic effect of the extract. HPLC fingerprinting of the extract was performed to ensure uniformity of the extract material used. In treated mice, the extract caused dose-related inhibition of acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction, and in the formalin test of antinociception the extract reduced formalin-induced pain in the second (late) but not in the first (early) phase of the pain. Treatment with the extract at doses of 0.5 and 1 g kg-1 significantly increased the reaction time in the hot-plate and warm-water tail-flick tests. Naloxone was ineffective in antagonizing the analgesic effect of C. italica on tail-flick and abdominal constriction tests, possibly indicating that the effect occurs via non-opiate pathways. The C. italica extract caused slight dose-related impairment of motor control which was significant only at a dose of 1 g kg-1. Treatment at the three doses used did not affect the rectal temperature of normothermic mice, but was effective in significantly reducing the rectal temperature of hyperthermic rats, 0.5 and 1 h (but not 6 h) after administration of the extract at doses of 0.5 and 1 g kg-1. The extract also produced progressive diminution in the ambulatory and total activity of treated mice for up to 2 h after administration. It is concluded that the crude ethanolic extract of C. italica has CNS depressant properties, manifested as antinociception and sedation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Desert and Marine Environment Research Centre, University of the UAE, Al-Ain, United Arab Emirates."}], "LastName": "Ali", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bashir", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanira", "ForeName": "M O", "Initials": "MO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0376363", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3573"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Narcotic Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "36B82AMQ7N", "NameOfSubstance": "Naloxone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cassia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Central Nervous System"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Naloxone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Narcotic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nociceptors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Psychomotor Performance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rectum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sleep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9178184", "10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06831.x"]}}]}
