Bovine erythrocytes were treated with rabbit antibovine red blood cell antibody. Rabbit plasma was diluted with veronal buffer and mixed with erythrocytes in the presence or absence of drugs and incubated. Erythrocytes were pelleted and the absorbance of the supernatant at 412 nm determined. Drugs could be grouped into three categories; (a) those with no effect whatsoever; (b) those which produced definite enhancement of the release of hemoglobin by the complement cascade, and (c) prednisolone, which inhibited the release of hemoglobin by the complement cascade. We suggest that prednisolone and the drugs which had no effect on the complement cascade are safer to use as anti-inflammatory agents, while drugs enhancing the complement cascade may have potential adverse properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Texas A & M University College of Medicine, College Station 77843-1114."}], "LastName": "Rohde", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okawara", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Varma", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiou", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Ophthalmic Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0267442", "ISSNLinking": "0030-3747"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-36-7", "NameOfSubstance": "Complement System Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9PHQ9Y1OLM", "NameOfSubstance": "Prednisolone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Complement Hemolytic Activity Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complement System Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemolysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Prednisolone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8196933", "10.1159/000267401"]}}]}
