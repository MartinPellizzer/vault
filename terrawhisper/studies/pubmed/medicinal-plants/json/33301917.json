Bailey rhizome extract ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis via modulating intestinal mucosal dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and TLR4/ NF-\u04a1B and NLRP3 inflammasome pathways.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "113670", "MedlinePgn": "113670"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Genus Canna is used in folk medicine as demulcent, diaphoretic, antipyretic, mild laxative and in gastrointestinal upsets therapy. Canna x generalis (CG) L.H. Bailey is traditionally used as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic. Besides, CG is used in Ayurvedic medicines' preparations and in the treatment of boils, wounds, and abscess. Nevertheless, its anti-inflammatory effects against ulcerative colitis (UC) are not yet investigated.", "This study aimed to investigate the phytoconstituents of CG rhizome ethanol extract (CGE). Additionally, we aimed to comparatively evaluate its therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms against the reference drug \"sulphasalazine (SAS)\" in dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced UC in mice.", "Metabolic profiling of CG rhizomes was performed via UHPLC/qTOF-HRMS; the total phenolic, flavonoid and steroid contents were determined, and the main phytoconstituents were isolated and identified. Next, DSS-induced (4%) acute UC was established in C57BL/6 mice. DSS-induced mice were administered either CGE (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) or SAS (200\u00a0mg/kg) for 7 days. Body weight, colon length, disease activity index (DAI) and histopathological alterations in colon tissues were examined. Colon levels of oxidative stress (GSH, MDA, SOD and catalase) and pro-inflammatory [Myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and INF-\u03b3] markers were colourimetrically determined. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and relative mRNA expressions of occludin, TLR4 and ASC (Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Protein Containing CARD) using RT-PCR were measured. Protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaved caspase-1 were determined by Western blot. Furthermore, immunohistochemical examinations of caspase-3, NF-\u04a1B and claudin-1 were performed.", "Major identified constituents of CGE were flavonoids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, beside five isolated phytoconstituents (\u03b2-sitosterol, triacontanol fatty alcohol, \u03b2-sitosterol-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside, rosmarinic acid, 6-O-p-coumaroyl-\u03b2-D-fructofuranosyl \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside). The percentage of the phenolic, flavonoid and steroid contents in CGE were 20.55, 6.74 and 98.09\u00a0\u03bcg of gallic acid, quercetin and \u03b2-sitosterol equivalents/mg extract, respectively. In DSS-induced mice, CGE treatment ameliorated DAI, body weight loss and colon shortening. CGE attenuated the DSS-induced colonic histopathological alternations, inflammatory cell infiltration and histological scores. CGE elevated GSH, SOD and catalase levels, and suppressed MDA, pro-inflammatory mediators (MPO and NO) as well as cytokines levels in colonic tissues. Moreover, CGE downregulated LPS/TLR4 signaling, caspase-3 and NF-\u04a1B expressions. CGE treatment inhibited NLRP3 signaling pathway as indicated by the suppression of the protein expression of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1, and the ASC mRNA expression in colonic tissues. Additionally, CGE restored tight junction proteins' (occludin and claudin-1) expressions.", "Our findings provided evidence for the therapeutic potential of CGE against UC. CGE restored intestinal mucosal barrier's integrity, mitigated oxidative stress, inflammatory cascade, as well as NF-\u04a1B/TLR4 and NLRP3 pathways activation in colonic tissues. Notably, CGE in a dose of 200\u00a0mg/kg was more effective in ameliorating DSS-induced UC as compared to SAS at the same dose."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
