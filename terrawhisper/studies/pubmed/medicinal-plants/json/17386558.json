The proposed system set-up for this current work was simpler as no heating and back pressure regulator was required. Extraction with surfactant assisted PLE was carried out dynamically at a flow of 1.5 mL min(-1), at room temperature, under an applied pressure of 10-20 bar with an extraction time of 45-50 min. The extraction efficiencies of the proposed method using surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100 were compared with sonication using organic solvent for different batches of medicinal plants materials. For the determination of glycyrrhizin in R. glycyrrhizae, the extraction efficiencies of surfactant assisted PLE with SDS and Triton X-100 was observed to be comparable with sonication. The method precision was found to vary from 1.6 to 2.6% (R.S.D., n=6) on different days. For ephedrine in E. sinica, surfactant assisted PLE with SDS was found to give higher extraction efficiencies compared to Triton X-100. The overall method precision for surfactant assisted PLE with SDS for ephedrine in E. sinica was found to vary from 1.5 to 4.1% (R.S.D., n=6) on different days. The marker compounds present in the various medicinal plant extracts were determined by gradient elution HPLC. Our data showed the possibility of PLE at room temperature and the advantages of eliminating the use of organic solvents in the extraction process."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Science School, Temasek Polytechnic, 21 Tampinese Avenue 1, Singapore 529757, Singapore."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Eng", "ForeName": "Alan Teck Wee", "Initials": "AT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heng", "ForeName": "Ming Yuan", "Initials": "MY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ong", "ForeName": "Eng Shi", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Validation Study"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chim Acta", "NlmUniqueID": "0370534", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2670"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Surface-Active Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6FO62043WK", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN83C131XS", "NameOfSubstance": "Ephedrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ephedrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhizic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Surface-Active Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "9", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17386558", "10.1016/j.aca.2006.09.019", "S0003-2670(06)01913-1"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
