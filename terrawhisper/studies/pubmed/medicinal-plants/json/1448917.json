Full-length copies of CPSMV RNA 1 were cloned in plasmids bearing a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Previously, similar clones of CPSMV RNA 2 had been obtained. A 5'-rUAUUAAAAUUUU sequence is common to RNA 1 and RNA 2. From two RNA 1 clones and four RNA 2 clones we excised non-CPSMV sequences so as to provide templates for in vitro transcripts that have only a single guanylate preceding CPSMV RNA sequences. Transcripts from the most active RNA 1 and RNA 2 clones, when mixed, showed about 5% of the infectivity of unfractionated CPSMV RNAs from virions. The longest, 1858 codon open reading frame of the 5957 nt CPSMV RNA 1 extends from an AUG at nt 257 to a UGA termination codon at nt 5831. The calculated molecular weight of the polyprotein is 208,000. Comparisons with the available amino acid residue (aa) sequence information from the complete CPMV RNA 1 sequence and the partial sequence of red clover mottle virus RNA 1 suggest that CPSMV RNA 1 specifies the expected set of five mature proteins: 32K proteinase cofactor, 58K presumed helicase, VPg 5'-linked protein of the genomic RNAs, 24K proteinase, and 87K presumed polymerase, separated by four cleavage sites. Of the determined and deduced cleavage sites of the three RNA 1 polyproteins, only that at the 24K/87K junction has a distinct aa pair in the CPSMV polyprotein. Of the five proteins, VPg and 87K show the greatest similarity between CPSMV and CPMV, with identities of 68 and 55%, respectively. Published mutational analysis of the CPMV 24K proteinase and alignment of aa sequences from three comoviruses suggest that cysteine-168, histidine-40 and glutamic acid-77 form the catalytic triad of the CPSMV 24K proteinase. Results are discussed in the context of the resistance that some cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) lines exhibit against CPMV but not against CPSMV."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Davis 95616."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bruening", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["M83830"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Precursors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Precursors"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Virulence"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1448917", "10.1016/0042-6822(92)90236-i"]}}]}
