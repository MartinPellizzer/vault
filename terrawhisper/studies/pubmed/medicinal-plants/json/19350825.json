A RP-HPLC method was established for determination of free and total luteolin in SD rats' plasma and gastrointestinal tract and total luteolin in SD rats' heart, liver, lung and kidney at 0.17, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after administration of EEB to 24 male SD rats (4 rats per one time spot). Luteolin glycoside was hydrolyzed to aglycone luteolin in intestinal tract, and then luteolin was absorbed. The main form of luteolin existed in gastrointestinal tract after administration of EEB is aglycone. The content of luteolin in liver and kidney were higher than that in heart and lung. The content of luteolin in kidney, heart and lung were showed max at 1 h. Its peak time was similar to that in blood. However, in liver, the drug was distributed quickly, and showed max at 0.17 h. And because of the sensitivity of the method, luteolin was not be detected in other tissues. The method is sensitive, specific, accurate, and is appropriate for determination of luteolin in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Jing-yan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Jin-lei", "Initials": "JL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "Tong-wei", "Initials": "TW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intestinal Absorption"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Distribution"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19350825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
