Due to their high environmental content and toxicity, natural radionuclides - polonium <sup>210</sup>Po and lead <sup>210</sup>Pb are the most dangerous radioisotopes for human health.", "70 raw medicinal herbal materials from 54 popular wild-growing medicinal plant species, most of them included in the European Pharmacopoeia, were collected across three regions. In 210 samples, the activity concentrations of <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb were determined, and their radiotoxicity and cancer risk were calculated.", "The results of <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb activities measured in herbal raw material were from 0.12\u202fmBq\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight in the fruits of the common chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) to 19.7\u202fmBq\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> dw in herb of ground elder (Aegopodium podagraria) for <sup>210</sup>Po, while for <sup>210</sup>Pb ranged from 0.16\u202fmBq\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> dw to 34.3\u202fmBq\u202fg<sup>-1</sup> dw in the same plants. There were statistically significant differences between <sup>210</sup>Po and <sup>210</sup>Pb content in leaves, herbs, flowers, and fruit. The studies indicated that the estimated annual effective radiation dose from Polish medicinal herbs consumption was low, ranging 0.03-105\u202f\u00b5Sv from <sup>210</sup>Po and 0.02-98.2\u202f\u00b5Sv from <sup>210</sup>Pb, while the risk of cancer morbidity and mortality ranged from 10<sup>-5</sup> to 10<sup>-9</sup>.", "Consumption of the tested medicinal herbs is safe from the radiological point of view and, based on the predictions related to the calculated risk of cancer, should not increase the probability of its occurrence."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
