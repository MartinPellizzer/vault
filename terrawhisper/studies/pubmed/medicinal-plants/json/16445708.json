Brazilian forests show high diversity of medicinal plants and several are used in folk medicine for the treatment of hypertension and asthma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a methanol extract (ME) of Cecropia lyratiloba and its flavonoid fraction (FF) on the contractility of cardiac, vascular and tracheal smooth muscles. 2. Twitches of rat papillary muscles were obtained with electrical stimulation and were recorded before and after exposure to increasing concentrations of ME and FF. 3. Cardiac depression was induced by FF. At 500 microg/mL FF, the amplitude of twitches was reduced to 56.7 +/- 5.1% of control values (P < 0.05). 4. The contractile response to a single concentration of adrenaline (10 micromol/L) was measured before and after exposure to ME and FF in rat aorta rings with intact endothelium. Both ME and FF inhibited adrenaline-induced contractions of the aorta in a concentration-dependent manner. Adrenaline-induced contractions were reduced to 46.4 +/- 9.9 and 34.2 +/- 6.9% (P < 0.05) of control in the presence of 500 microg/mL ME and FF, respectively. 5. The flavonoids isolated from FF, namely isoorientin and a mixture of orientin and isovitexin, were also tested in the aorta. These flavonoid do not seem to be responsible for the vasorelaxant effects of ME and FF. 6. No changes were observed in acetylcholine-precontracted trachea when exposed to ME or FF. 7. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation induced by FF is likely to be mediated by the release of nitric oxide because vascular relaxation was abolished in the presence of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. 8. In conclusion, vascular relaxation induced by ME and FF could explain the traditional use of the extract of C. lyratiloba for treatment of arterial hypertension."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacologia B\u00e1sica e Clinica, Instituto de Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas, Universidade Federal do rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ramos Almeida", "ForeName": "Roberta", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montani Raimundo", "ForeName": "Juliana", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodrigues Oliveira", "ForeName": "Rodrigo", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Coelho Kaplan", "ForeName": "Maria Auxiliadora", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gattass", "ForeName": "Cerli Rocah", "Initials": "CR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sudo", "ForeName": "Roberto Takashi", "Initials": "RT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zapata-Sudo", "ForeName": "Gisele", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0425076", "ISSNLinking": "0305-1870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "V55S2QJN2X", "NameOfSubstance": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YKH834O4BH", "NameOfSubstance": "Epinephrine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aorta, Thoracic"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cecropia Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Epinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Isometric Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Papillary Muscles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trachea"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16445708", "10.1111/j.1440-1681.2006.04332.x", "CEP"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
