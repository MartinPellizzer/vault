The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by analysis of their spectroscopic data including 1D, 2D NMR, HRESI-MS<sup>n</sup> and IR data. The relative configuration of compounds 1/2 was deduced by comparison of their experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation data with those reported in literature. The absolute configuration of solaniol (10), a known compound with undefined absolute stereochemistry, was established for the first time by X-ray diffraction analysis of a single-crystal structure using Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The antibacterial activities of the crude fungal extract and the compounds isolated from the fungus were evaluated against some clinically important bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, as well as an environmental strain of Escherichia coli and the soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp. BD4. Compounds 3/4 and 6 exhibited antibacterial efficacies against the soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp., comparable to the reference standard streptomycin. All the tested compounds (1-9) demonstrated antibacterial activity against the environmental strain of E. coli, whereas no antibacterial activity was observed against S. aureus and B. subtilis. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds typically against E. coli and Acinetobacter sp. provides further insight into the possible involvement of root-borne endophytes in chemical defense of their host plants in selected ecological niches."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
