Compared with the control group, oral administration of the 50% methanol extract (10 mg/kg) from its stems inhibited the edema by 38% in volume, which was induced 4 hr after stimulation by carrageenin in rats. This inhibitory effect on edema formation has been most significant in the n-butanol soluble fraction compared with the ethyl ether- or water-soluble ones, and the action of the n-butanol fraction has been observed in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 1 to 30 mg/kg, p.o. Administration of this fraction by the s.c., or i.p. route also inhibited the carrageenin-induced edema formation to the same degree as that by the oral route. The 3 mg/kg, s.c. dosage of the fraction corresponds roughly to 250 mg/kg sulpyrine and 10 mg/kg diphenhydramine, s.c. Moreover, the fraction administered i.v. also reduced LPS-induced fever in rabbits, and had an antagonistic effect equivalent to 100 mg/kg sulpyrine and 1 mg/kg morphine hydrochloride (in i.p.-administration). The comprehensive anti-inflammatory substance(s) contained in T.c. stems are moderately non-polar compounds soluble in n-butanol and absorbable from both walls of the gut and vessels. The usefulness of a modified dosage of this plant extract for clinical treatment of various types of inflammation is highly suggested."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Higashino", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suzuki", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tanaka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pootakham", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0420550", "ISSNLinking": "0015-5691"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1446884", "10.1254/fpj.100.339"]}}]}
