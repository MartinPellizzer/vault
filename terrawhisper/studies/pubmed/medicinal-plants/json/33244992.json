Some fractions and compounds from <i>Uvaria comperei</i> exhibited good antifungal activity against clinical isolates and standard strains of yeast species of <i>Candida</i> and <i>Cryptococcus</i> genera while extracts from <i>Oxyanthus unilocularis</i> displayed weak antifungal activity. The results obtained show that <i>Uvaria comperei</i> could be a potential source of antifungal drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
