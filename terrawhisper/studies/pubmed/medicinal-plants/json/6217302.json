Kinusaya). The enzyme required additional Mg2+ for its function. The pH optimum for glucosylation of pyridoxine was between 7.8 and 8.8. The enzyme showed high specificity for UDP-glucose and relative specificity for glucosyl acceptor: pyridoxine was replaceable by pyridoxamine. Several compounds tested other than vitamin B6 failed to serve as the acceptor. It was shown that a methylene group on C-4 participated in the formation of enzyme-substrate complex, and that the rate of glucosylation was dependent upon the C-4 substituent. From the results of kinetic studies and an experiment in vivo, the enzyme was inferred to be UDP-glucose: pyridoxine 5'-O-beta-glucosyltransferase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tadera", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yagi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kobayashi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0402640", "ISSNLinking": "0301-4800"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "26545-80-2", "NameOfSubstance": "5'-O-(glucopyranosyl)pyridoxine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KV2JZ1BI6Z", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyridoxine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyridoxine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6217302", "10.3177/jnsv.28.359"]}}]}
