They differed from each other in terms of their immunological properties, hemagglutinating activities, sugar inhibition patterns, and amino acid compositions. Both lectins were acidic and one of them (L-I), which was inactive toward trypsinized human type O erythrocytes, was similar to one of green shell lectins (WGS-1); which resembled basic seed lectin in its immunological properties. The amino-terminal sequence of L-I was homologous to that of WGS-1. The amino acid composition of L-I was similar to that of basic seed lectin, but the extent of the homology between amino-terminal sequences was low when L-I and basic seed lectin were compared. Examination by ELISA revealed that L-I and WGS-1 were distinct from the basic lectins of seeds and tuberous roots. L-I had a disulfide bridge between two subunits and it exhibited high hemagglutinating activity toward human type A erythrocytes, as compared to its activity toward other erythrocytes. By contrast, the properties of a second acidic lectin from winged bean leaves (L-II) were very similar to those of acidic lectins from seeds and tuberous roots, and the similarities extended as far as the immunological properties."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemical Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagoshima University, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yagi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sawada", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Imada", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Toyonaga", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tadera", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishihata", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hemagglutination Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7820375"]}}]}
