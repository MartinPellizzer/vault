They have immense therapeutic potential, encapsulating a plethora of metabolites within them, which have yet to be explored. <i>Withania somnifera</i> (L.) Dunal is one such medicinal plant known since time immemorial for its therapeutic activity in the Ayurveda system of medicine. Studies have revealed Nature's marvel of these medicinal plants harbouring endophytic and epiphytic microorganisms from phyllosphere to rhizosphere. Chromatographic fingerprinting was carried out using HPTLC and HPLC on five epiphytic strains isolated from the leaves, stem and fruits of <i>Withania somnifera</i>. Out of five filamentous fungi, one fungus identified as <i>Aspergillus aculeatus</i> S20 was well explored. An indole alkaloid, okaramine H, was isolated using systematic chromatographic investigation at a retention time of 26.278 min showing <i>\u03bb</i><sub>max</sub> at 206, 236, 284 and 370 nm. Confirmation was achieved using NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) as analytical techniques. Structure elucidation was done by studying the fragmentation pattern using MS/MS and an accurate mass was determined using HR-ESI-QTOF-MS showing <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> of 521.2546 [M + H]<sup>+</sup>. The percentage purity of isolated okaramine H was found to be >90. Well known for its insecticidal activity, okaramine H was explored for its antileishmanial activity against the <i>Leishmania donovani</i> parasite for the first time. Under <i>in vitro</i> conditions, the compound showed an inhibitory effect on <i>Leishmania donovani</i> promastigotes with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 147 \u03bcg mL<sup>-1</sup>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Control & Quality Assurance Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India. dsingh@iiim.res.in."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Vandana", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fermentation and Microbial Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Chib", "ForeName": "Shifali", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Kumari", "ForeName": "Diksha", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8225-0622"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Kuljit", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9841-7343"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fermentation and Microbial Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Saran", "ForeName": "Saurabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5347-6713"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Control & Quality Assurance Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India. dsingh@iiim.res.in."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Management & Instrumentation Division, CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine Canal Road Jammu Tawi, 180001, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific & Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Deepika", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anal Methods", "NlmUniqueID": "101519733", "ISSNLinking": "1759-9660"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["39114899", "10.1039/d4ay00901k"]}}]}
