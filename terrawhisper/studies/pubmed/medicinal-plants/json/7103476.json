For this study, uptake of bacteriophage f2 was measured in corn and bean plants growing in hydroponic solutions. Few phage were detected in plants with uncut roots. However, when roots of both plant types were cut just before exposure to very high concentrations of phage, the amount of phage uptake was several orders of magnitude greater than with uncut roots, but still was considerably less than that which was theoretically possible. Furthermore, cut roots were rapidly repaired, thus inhibiting uptake, and the amount of uptake in plants with cut roots was proportional to phage exposure levels. Finally, phage were transported to all plant parts examined, but their survival times within each portion of the plants appeared to be of limited duration. All of these factors tend to minimize the possible public health significance associated with viral uptake through the root systems of plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ward", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mahler", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Environ Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "7605801", "ISSNLinking": "0099-2240"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coliphages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Med Dosw Mikrobiol. 1973;25(1):83-92", "ArticleIdList": ["4708469"]}, {"Citation": "Appl Environ Microbiol. 1977 Jan;33(1):109-13", "ArticleIdList": ["189685"]}, {"Citation": "Virology. 1958 Dec;6(3):623-36", "ArticleIdList": ["13616176"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7103476", "PMC244192", "10.1128/aem.43.5.1098-1103.1982"]}}]}
