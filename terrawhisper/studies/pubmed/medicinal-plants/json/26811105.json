Trace element levels were assessed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The data indicate that the leaves of P. lanceolata are characterized by the highest Co, Cr, and Se content, whereas P. maxima leaves contained the greatest levels of Si and Zn. In contrast, the highest concentrations of Co, Cr, Fe, I, Mn, Si, and V were detected in the roots of P. major. Zn content was also higher in P. maxima roots than in the other species analyzed. The toxic trace elements were differentially distributed across the studied species. In particular, P. lanceolata leaves contained significantly higher Al, As, Li, Ni, Pb, and Sr levels, whereas the B and Cd content was elevated in P. major as compared to the other species. Surprisingly, the leaf Hg level was the lowest in P. major, whose levels of Al, As, B, Cd, Ni, Li, and Sr were significantly higher than the other two species. The data indicate that the concentration of most of the essential trace elements was higher in the leaves and roots of P. major and P. lanceolata than in P. maxima, while P. maxima had less toxic metals. The obtained data on trace elements content in Plantago tissues may be taken into account while using plant preparations in practical medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Applied Bioelementology, Yaroslavl State University, Sovetskaya st., 14, Yaroslavl, 150000, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Grina St., 7, Moscow, 117216, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia. tinkov.a.a@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Tinkov", "ForeName": "Alexey A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nemereshina", "ForeName": "Olga N", "Initials": "ON"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Nutrition and Hygiene, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Wojska Polskiego 31 Str., 60-624, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Suliburska", "ForeName": "Joanna", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Gatiatulina", "ForeName": "Evgenia R", "Initials": "ER"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Human Nutrition and Hygiene, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Wojska Polskiego 31 Str., 60-624, Poznan, Poland."}], "LastName": "Regula", "ForeName": "Julita", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Orenburg State Medical University, Sovetskaya St., 6, Orenburg, 460000, Russia."}], "LastName": "Nikonorov", "ForeName": "Alexandr A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Biotechnology and Applied Bioelementology, Yaroslavl State University, Sovetskaya st., 14, Yaroslavl, 150000, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "All-Russian Research Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Grina St., 7, Moscow, 117216, Russia."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Russian Society of Trace Elements in Medicine, ANO \"Centre for Biotic Medicine\", Zemlyanoy Val St. 46, Moscow, 105064, Russia."}], "LastName": "Skalny", "ForeName": "Anatoly V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plantago"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "1", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26811105", "10.1007/s12011-016-0626-2", "10.1007/s12011-016-0626-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
