Here, an innovative sensitive methodology based on near-infrared spectroscopy coupled with multivariate analysis has been proposed for the robust detection and quantification of urea adulteration in fresh milk samples. In this study, 162 fresh milk samples were used, those consisting 20 nonadulterated samples (without urea) and 142 with urea adulterant. Eight different percentage levels of urea adulterant, that is, 0.10%, 0.30%, 0.50%, 0.70%, 0.90%, 1.10%, 1.30%, and 1.70%, were prepared, each of them prepared in triplicates. A Frontier NIR spectrophotometer (BSEN60825-1:2007) by Perkin Elmer was used for scanning the absorption of each sample in the wavenumber range of 10,000-4,000\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>, using 0.2\u00a0mm path length CaF<sub>2</sub> sealed cell at resolution of 2\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup>. Principal components analysis (PCA), partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and partial least-squares regressions (PLSR) methods were applied for the multivariate analysis of the NIR spectral data collected. PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data and to explore the similarities and differences among the fresh milk samples and the adulterated ones. PLS-DA also showed the discrimination between the nonadulterated and adulterated milk samples. The <i>R</i>-square and root mean square error (RMSE) values obtained for the PLS-DA model were 0.9680 and 0.08%, respectively. Furthermore, PLSR model was also built using the training set of NIR spectral data to make a regression model. For this PLSR model, leave-one-out cross-validation procedure was used as an internal cross-validation criteria and the <i>R</i>-square and the root mean square error (RMSE) values for the PLSR model were found as 0.9800 and 0.56%, respectively. The PLSR model was then externally validated using a test set. The root means square error of prediction (RMSEP) obtained was 0.48%. The present proposed study was intended to contribute toward the development of a robust, sensitive, and reproducible method to detect and determine the urea adulterant concentration in fresh milk samples."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 The Authors.
