Due to some limitations of experimental investigations, computational methods have played an important role in obtaining the knowledge of protein-nucleic acid interaction. Over the past few years, dozens of computational tools have been used for identification of nucleic acid binding site for site-specific proteins and design of site-specific nucleases because of their significant advantages in genome editing. Here, we review existing widely-used computational tools for target prediction of site-specific proteins as well as off-target prediction of site-specific nucleases. This article provides a list of on-line prediction tools according to their features followed by the description of computational methods used by these tools, which range from various sequence mapping algorithms (like Bowtie, FetchGWI and BLAST) to different machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machine, hidden Markov models, Random Forest, elastic network and deep neural networks). We also make suggestions on the further development in improving the accuracy of prediction methods. This survey will provide a reference guide for computational biologists working in the field of genome editing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Ming", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China."}], "LastName": "Ding", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, James Clark School of Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, United States."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Shuo-Xin", "Initials": "SX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China."}], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Shu-Qin", "Initials": "SQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Mathematics and Informatics, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Xu-Hong", "Initials": "XH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy and Biological Engineering, Sichuan Industrial Institute of Antibiotics, Key Laboratory of Medicinal and Edible Plants Resources Development of Sichuan Education Department, Antibiotics Research and Re-Evaluation Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Chengdu University, Chengdu 610106, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jian-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Jiangsu University of Technology, Changzhou 213001, China."}], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Shan", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Protein Pept Lett", "NlmUniqueID": "9441434", "ISSNLinking": "0929-8665"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nucleic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Protein"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Editing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Machine Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Binding"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "9", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "11", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31746287", "10.2174/0929866526666191028162302", "PPL-EPUB-101961"]}}]}
