However, its involvement in mitigation of oxidative stress generated by plant parasitic nematode in plants remains elusive. In the present investigation, the efficacy of microbe's viz., Chitiniphilus sp. MTN22 and Streptomyces sp. MTN14 single and in combinations was examined to mitigate oxidative stress generated by M. incognita in medicinal plant, Bacopa monnieri. Microbial combination with and without pathogen also enhanced the growth parameters along with secondary metabolites (bacoside) of B. monnieri than the pathogen inoculated control. The study showed that initially the production of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was higher in dual microbes infected with pathogen which further declined over M. incognita inoculated control plants. Superoxide dismutase and free radical scavenging activity were also highest in the same treatment which was linearly related with least lipid peroxidation and root gall formation in B. monnieri under the biotic stress. Microscopic visualization of total reactive oxygen species (ROS), H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, superoxide radical and programmed cell death in host plant further extended our knowledge and corroborated well with the above findings. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy confirmed good microbial colonization on the host root surface around nematode penetration sites in plants treated with dual microbes under pathogenic stress. The findings offer novel insight into the mechanism adopted by the synergistic microbial strains in mitigating oxidative stress and simultaneously stimulating bacoside production under pathogenic stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier GmbH.
