This paper established a comprehensive assessment system, including 2 sub-systems, 5 respects, and 14 indices. In the meanwhile, risk assessment indices and experience formula were used to analyze the risk degree of pests in Lycium barbarum fields under different managements. It was found that using risk assessment indices and experience formula could obtain similar results. In abandoned field, Aceria palida, Aphis sp., and Paratrioza sinica were the frequent disaster pests, Lema decempunctata, Neoceratitis asiatica, Jaapiella sp., and Phthorimaea sp. were the incidental disaster pests, and Psylliodes obscurofaciata and Phthorimaea sp. were general pests. In organic field, the frequent disaster pests were the same species as those in abandoned field, while P. indicus, Jaapiella sp. and Phthorimaea sp. were the incidental disaster pests. In chemical control field, A. palida, Aphis sp., P. sinica, and P. indicus were the frequent disaster pests, while Jaapiella sp. and Phthorimaea sp. were the incidental disaster pests. Optimal 5 separations most fitted the division of pest sub-communities in L. barbarum fields, which were infancy period (from March 28 to April 15), outbreak I period (from April 15 to July 18), dormancy period (from July 18 to September 8), outbreak II period (from September 8 to October 15), and recession period (after October 15). The matrix of correlation coefficient showed that the dynamics of pests in L. barbarum fields under different managements were significantly correlated with each other, suggesting that the dynamics of pest populations was similar in different L. barbarum fields, which had two population establishment stages and one exponential growth stage in every year. The optimal controlling stages were from late infancy period to early and middle outbreak I periods, and from late dormancy period to early outbreak II period, which were very critical for pest control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Agronomy, Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750001, China. zihuazhao@126.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Zi-Hua", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Da-Han", "Initials": "DH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fang", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ting-Ting", "Initials": "TT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zong-Shan", "Initials": "ZS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Aphids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lepidoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "7", "Day": "2", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19565765"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
