Astilbin is a bioactive ingredient found in many medicinal and food plants, with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties.", "This study aimed to investigate the protective effect and related molecular mechanism of astilbin against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats.", "Liver fibrosis was induced by injection of CCl4 in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and those rats were then treated with astilbin at different concentrations. Pathological changes, collagen production, inflammatory cytokine, and oxidative stress were evaluated to evaluate the effects of astilbin on CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis. Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to detect the mRNA and protein expression of indicated genes.", "We discovered that CCl4 caused significant fibrosis damage in rat liver, and astilbin dose-dependently improved the liver functions and fibrosis degree. Astilbin treatment significantly decreased collagen production, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in vivo. Mechanically, administration of astilbin obviously elevated the hepatic levels of Nrf2 and its downstream components, including NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), heme oxygenase (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier.", "Taken together, these findings demonstrate that astilbin could protect against CCL4 induced-liver fibrosis in rats."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 S.
