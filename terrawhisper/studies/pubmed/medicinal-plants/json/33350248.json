Olibanum was first described as a medicinal by the name &quot;Xunluxiang&quot; in Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians(Ming Yi Bie Lu). This study investigated historical records on olibanum and conducted the herbalogical study. It was found that olibanum came from the resin mainly obtained from the bark of Pistacia lenticus before the Tang Dynasty. With the prosperity of the Maritime Silk Road, instead, the resin obtained from the bark of Boswellia carterii was mainly used as olibanum. In ancient time, the oleo-gum-resin secreted from the cut bark was collected in spring and summer, and the quality was judged based on transparency and shape. The processing methods of olibanum went through many evolutions, which changed from simple methods such as grinding and frying to complex methods such as levigating and grinding with wine, and now to frying and processing with vinegar. The usage of olibanum included alchemy, folk and religious incense, bathing, cosmetic and medicinal since ancient times. From the Song Dynasty, olibanum had been mainly used as medicinal because of its good effect to treat wounds. In traditional Chinese medicine, olibanum unblocks menstruation, relieves pain and reduces swelling and generated muscles. The medicinal efficacy of olibanum is not much different from ancient to modern. Only the efficacy of replenishing energy and promoting the movement of Qi was rarely mentioned in modern reference. In this article, the historical evolutions of olibanum about original plants, processing and medicinal efficacy were sorted out. The results could provide historical basis for the further development and clinical utilization of olibanum."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Zi-Han", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Meng-Hua", "ForeName": "W U", "Initials": "WU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Si-Min", "ForeName": "Luo", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhou", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Ying", "ForeName": "Zhang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Zhi-Guo", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Engineering Research Center for Modernization of Traditional Chinese Medicine Lingnan Resources Branch,Xiaotao WANG Processing Inheritance Studio in Guangdong Branch, Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Lingnan(Southern China), College of Pharmacy, Jinan University Guangzhou 510632, China."}], "LastName": "Hui", "ForeName": "Cao", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Resins, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R9XLF1R1WM", "NameOfSubstance": "Frankincense"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Frankincense"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Resins, Plant"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "52"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33350248", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200721.101"]}}]}
