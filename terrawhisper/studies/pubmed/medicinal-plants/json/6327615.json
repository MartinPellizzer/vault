The protein, which had a subunit molecular weight of ca. 24,000 ( 24K ), was found to be present in large amounts within bacteria that had been reisolated from the surface of inoculated pea roots but was not detected in bacteroids isolated from nodules. The protein could also be induced during growth of R. leguminosarum on nutrient medium and was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of broken cells. Antiserum raised against the purified protein was used to screen transposon-induced mutants of R. leguminosarum, and four independent mutants were isolated which lacked the protein. The sites of the Tn5 insertions were found to map between the nitrogenase and nodulation genes on symbiotic plasmid pRL1JI , ca. 5 kilobases from the nitrogenase genes and 13 kilobases from the nodulation genes. Genetic determinants for the 24K protein were found to be closely linked to plasmid-borne nodulation genes for all strains of R. leguminosarum tested. However, the mutants which lacked the 24K protein still formed normal nitrogen-fixing nodules on peas, and the function of the protein is unknown."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dibb", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Downie", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brewin", "ForeName": "N J", "Initials": "NJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Bacteriol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985120R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9193"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Transposable Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.18.6.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Transposable Elements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Bacterial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen Fixation"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Plasmid. 1978 Sep;1(4):584-8", "ArticleIdList": ["107540"]}, {"Citation": "Nature. 1970 Aug 15;227(5259):680-5", "ArticleIdList": ["5432063"]}, {"Citation": "Biochemistry. 1971 Jun 22;10(13):2606-17", "ArticleIdList": ["4326772"]}, {"Citation": "Biochem J. 1964 May;91(2):222-33", "ArticleIdList": ["4158310"]}, {"Citation": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Sep;76(9):4350-4", "ArticleIdList": ["388439"]}, {"Citation": "Anal Biochem. 1982 Jan 1;119(1):142-7", "ArticleIdList": ["7072935"]}, {"Citation": "Mol Gen Genet. 1979;177(1):65-72", "ArticleIdList": ["231729"]}, {"Citation": "J Gen Microbiol. 1974 Sep;84(1):188-98", "ArticleIdList": ["4612098"]}, {"Citation": "EMBO J. 1983;2(6):947-52", "ArticleIdList": ["16453461"]}, {"Citation": "Nucleic Acids Res. 1980 Jan 11;8(1):1-20", "ArticleIdList": ["6243775"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6327615", "PMC215474", "10.1128/jb.158.2.621-627.1984"]}}]}
