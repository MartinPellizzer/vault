Within them, cipacinerasins A and B feature a rearranged tetrahydropyranyl ring B formed between C-8 and C-30, are unusual miscellaneous-type limonoids. Cipacinerasins E and F are rare trijugin-type limonoids, of which the D-ring \u03b4-lactone is cleaved. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic data (HRESIMS, NMR, UV and IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD) calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All compounds were evaluated in vitro cytotoxicity against five human tumor cell lines (K562, HeLa, PC3, LN-Cap and Hell), and cipacinerasin E showed moderate antitumor activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8.0 to 24.8\u00a0\u03bcM."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
