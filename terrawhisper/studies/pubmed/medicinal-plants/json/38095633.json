Meanwhile, the levels of several cytokines and PBMC subtypes (CD4, CD3, CD8, NK and B cells) were detected too. The Spearman correlation analysis, one-way ANOVA and multivariate logit regression were conducted. Results suggested that the levels of total protein and albumin were significantly decreased in patients with poor outcomes, and the levels of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were significantly correlated with hospitalization outcomes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes had higher levels of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 than those patients without diabetes. The levels of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and Il-10 in the dead patients were significantly higher than those in the recovery and worse patients. Total protein and albumin were significantly positively correlated with levels of NK and B, CD4, CD8, CD3 lymphocytes. The levels of CD4, CD8 and CD3 lymphocytes were significantly decreased in dead patients than other patients. Multivariate logit regression analysis suggests that lymphocyte number, albumin and IL-6 are independent risk factors to evaluate the hospitalization outcome. In summary, nutritional biochemical indexes were significantly corelated with cytokines and PBMC subsets, and had an impact on the severity of COVID-19 patients. Improvement of low protein malnutrition is broad-spectrum and basic strategy to improve the hospitalization outcome of COVID-19."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and Lishui City People&#x2019;s Hospital, Lishui 323000, Zhejiang Province, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Peng", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, College of Pharmacy, Guizhou Provincial Engineering Technology Research Center for Chemical Drug R&amp;D, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, Guizhou, P.R.
