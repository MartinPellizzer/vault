In our study, 258 small molecules were collected from lung-related herbal medicines, and their structures were optimized with the B3LYP-D3/6-31G* method. After the molecular docking with Mpro, we selected the top 20 compounds for the further geometry optimization with the larger basis sets. After the further molecular docking, the top eight compounds were screened out. Then we performed molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations to determine stability of the complexes. Our results show that mulberrofuran G, Xambioona, and kuwanon D can bind Mpro well. In quantum chemistry studies, such as ESP and CDFT analyses, the compounds properties are predicted. Additionally, the drug-likeness analyses and ADME studies on these three candidate compounds verified that all of them conform to Libinski's rule and may be drug-like compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1757-4241"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Tao", "ForeName": "Yulian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Qu", "ForeName": "Hanyang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shengpeng", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Science, Tianjin Chengjian University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cuihong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Meiling", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomol Struct Dyn", "NlmUniqueID": "8404176", "ISSNLinking": "0739-1102"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "3C-like proteinase, SARS-CoV-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protease Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "47"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "34"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36373329", "10.1080/07391102.2022.2144949"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
