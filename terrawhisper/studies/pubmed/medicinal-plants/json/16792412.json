Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses. Compound 4 was found to induce significant cell death in the human HeLa cell line. Apoptotic-related DNA damage can be positively related to the dose of compound 4. The DNA damage was measured by the percentage of subG1 (24 h after the treatment of compound 4) as determined by cell cycle analysis and TUNEL assay. Treatment with 4 significantly increased intracellular H2O2 and/or peroxide, nitric oxide (NO) at 1, 3, and 24 h. Our results also showed that compound 4 induced (a) noticeable reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), (b) activation of caspase 3/7, and (c) up-regulation of the p53 expression. Compound 4-induced DNA damage was found to markedly decrease when the cells were pretreated with an intracellular glutathione supplement (glutathione ethyl ester). These results suggest that an increase of H2O2 and/or peroxide by compound 4 is the initial apoptotic event. The intracellular GSH depletion is a critical event in compound 4-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate Institute of Biopharmaceutics, College of Life Sciences, National Chiayi University, Chiayi 600, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Ching-Hsein", "Initials": "CH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lo", "ForeName": "Wen-Li", "Initials": "WL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ya-Chen", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Chung-Yi", "Initials": "CY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "kotomolide A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "kotomolide B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP7 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 7"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "OL659KIY4X", "NameOfSubstance": "4-Butyrolactone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "4-Butyrolactone"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 7"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cinnamomum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flow Cytometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HeLa Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16792412", "10.1021/np060107l"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
