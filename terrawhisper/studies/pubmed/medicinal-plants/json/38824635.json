Three popular genera in food and traditional medicine, including <i>Zataria</i> Boiss.<i>, Thymus</i> L., and <i>Ziziphora</i> L., are considered as thyme-like plants in Iran. Thyme has been standardised based on phenolic monoterpenes, which are abundant in the essential oils of these three genera. Apart from monoterpenes, the flavonoid naringenin, the triterpene oleanolic acid, and phytosterols such as <i>\u03b2</i>-sitosterol were abundant in <i>Zataria</i>, <i>Thymus</i>, and <i>Ziziphora</i> samples, respectively. Therefore, employing current analytical techniques on the basis of thymol and carvacrol may be insufficient to differentiate <i>Thymus</i> spp from similar medicinal plants including <i>Zataria</i> and <i>Ziziphora</i> spp. In this study, we applied NMR-based metabolomics using multivariate analyses to develop quality control of thyme and their similar products. Our findings revealed that NMR-based metabolomics can be a useful approach in differentiating <i>Zataria</i>, <i>Thymus</i>, and <i>Ziziphora</i>."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aalinezhad", "ForeName": "Shokoufeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Traditional Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Emami", "ForeName": "Seyed Ahmad", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "36"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "36"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "2", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "32"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38824635", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2356714"]}}]}
