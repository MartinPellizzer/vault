(Myrtaceae) is a plant rich in polyphenols, and is used as anticough, antibronchitis and insecticide in folk medicine. Because of the biological importance of plant polyphenols, particularly tannins, a phytochemical study was of interest to investigate the constitutive poyphenols in the extracts of flowers and leaves.", "To avoid time-consuming methodology for isolation of a complex mixture of known metabolites, HPLC-ESI/MS was employed for fast picking up of the new compounds followed by identification of the structures with UV and one- and two-dimensional NMR.", "Flowers and leaves were separately extracted with hot aqueous methanol under reflux (70 degrees C). Pre-isolation of the total extracts was achieved through column chromatographic fractionation on polyamide with water-methanol for gradient elution. The main fractions were purified using repeated column chromatography on cellulose and/or Sephadex LH-20 with suitable eluents. HPLC-ESI/MS analyses were carried out in the single ion monitoring (SIM) and negative ion modes. The pure compounds in methanol-water (1:1) were analysed by direct infusion ESI/MS. Final structure elucidation was obtained by one- and two-dimensional NMR.", "Two new metabolites namely quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucuronopyranoside n-butyl ester (1) and n-butylgallate 4-O-(2',6'-di-O-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4) along with nine known ones were identified from the aqueous methanol extracts of flowers and leaves.", "The study has shown that Callistemon lanceolatus is rich in polyphenols. HPLC-ESI/MS may be used, in negative ion mode, as an efficient and rapid analytical tool for investigating complex plant extracts."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Group, Nobel Project, National Research Centre, El-Behoos St 31, Dokki, Cairo, Egypt. msmarzouk@yahoo.co.uk"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marzouk", "ForeName": "Mohamed S A", "Initials": "MS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Y4S76JWI15", "NameOfSubstance": "Methanol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrolyzable Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Methanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Myrtaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": ["economics", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18618463", "10.1002/pca.1082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
