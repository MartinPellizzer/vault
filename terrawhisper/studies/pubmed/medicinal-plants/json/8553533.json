Two such bipartite geminiviruses are bean golden mosaic virus (GBMV) and tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV). In both, the BL1 and BR1 genes are required for the spread of virus infection in plants. We have investigated the contributions of BL1 and BR1 to host-specific phenotypes of BGMV and TGMV by constructing hybrid viruses in which these coding regions were exchanged. Hybrids were assayed on bean, a good host for BGMV, and Nicotiana benthamiana, a good host for TGMV. A BGMV hybrid having TGMV BL1 and BR1 efficiently infected beans, but elicited attenuated symptoms. In N. benthamiana, this hybrid had slightly increased virulence and DNA accumulation relative to wild-type BGMV. A TGMV hybrid having BGMV BL1 and BR1 was virulent in N. benthamiana, but elicited attenuated symptoms. However, this hybrid exhibited no gain of function in beans relative to wild-type TGMV. Hybrid viruses with TGMV BL1 and BGMV BR1 had severely defective phenotypes in either viral or host background. Although exchanging BL1 and BR1 between BGMV and TGMV did not change host range, some host adaptation of these genes is suggested. However, virus-specific compatibility between BL1 and BR1 is of more importance for viability. Thus, these gene products may act in concert to potentiate virus movement."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology, North Carolina State University, Raleigh 27695-7615, USA."}], "LastName": "Schaffer", "ForeName": "R L", "Initials": "RL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miller", "ForeName": "C G", "Initials": "CG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Petty", "ForeName": "I T", "Initials": "IT"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM-48067", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Virology", "NlmUniqueID": "0110674", "ISSNLinking": "0042-6822"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Defective Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pathogenicity", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Geminiviridae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum lycopersicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phenotype"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viral Movement Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Nicotiana"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8553533", "10.1006/viro.1995.0042", "S0042-6822(85)70042-6"]}}]}
