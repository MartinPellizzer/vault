The final preparation was homogeneous by SDS-PAGE but revealed isozymes of relative mass of 38.3 and 39.6 kDa. The N-terminal sequence for both isozymes was identical, LANGLAKT (one letter code for amino acids). Relative native molecular mass was estimated at 149.3 kDa by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. Activity was unaffected by ionic strength at high enzyme concentrations, and was specific for alpha-D-galactoside conjugates. No protease or hemagglutinin activity was detected, and activity was stable at 4 degrees C. Studies with soluble oligosaccharides demonstrated high activity against the selected straight and branched-chain substrates. The enzyme was active against terminal alpha 1-3 galactosyl residues on human and rabbit erythrocyte membranes. Because of its activity against membrane glycoconjugates, these isozymes may have potential utility for modifying membrane epitopes on native erythrocytes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Missouri, Columbia 65211."}], "LastName": "Dhar", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitra", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hata", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Butnariu", "ForeName": "O", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Mol Biol Int", "NlmUniqueID": "9306673", "ISSNLinking": "1039-9712"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Galactosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoenzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.22", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-Galactosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Galactosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Isoenzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "alpha-Galactosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7703901"]}}]}
