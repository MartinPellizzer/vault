The nutritionally valued herbs were screened on the basis of a matrix modeling approach and molecular docking based validation analysis.", "The database of 38 herbs developed earlier using fuzzy logic based scoring analysis was subjected to molecular docking based validation. The molecular docking (Hex 6.12) analyses of predominant phytoligands (\u223c10 per herb) against exoenzyme S of P. aeruginosa filtered potent herbs were selected. The preauthenticated bacterial inoculum (10(8)\u00a0CFU/mL) was added to the sterile nutrient broth impregnated with standardized aqueous-alcoholic herbal extracts (1-1600\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, antibacterial activity was evaluated in terms of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations.", "Five herbs were selected on the basis of fuzzy set scoring, an herbal informatics model, and validation analysis based on energy of docking (i.e., Evalue of 380) phytoligands with maximum scoring obtained by Glycyrrhiza glabra. Among the 5 nutraceuticals, G. glabra showed maximum bactericidal activity significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher than Amikacin, a standard antibiotic, which was in consonance with in silico bioprospection. Zingiber officinale, despite a low Evalue, showed considerably higher inhibition attributed to its higher flavonoid content as compared to other herbs.", "G. glabra (licorice), a flavoring agent; Z. officinale (ginger), a condiment; and Mentha piperita (mint), a fragrance component, showed significant therapeutic potential against multidrug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
