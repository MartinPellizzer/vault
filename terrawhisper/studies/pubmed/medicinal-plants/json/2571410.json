This paper presents findings with follow-up through 1984. There were 227 statistically significant (P less than 0.05, two-tailed) associations: 170 positive, 57 negative. Some were undoubtedly chance findings; others were likely due to confounding by unmeasured covariables. However, several associations suggested hypotheses for further studies and/or the need for continued observation. Most notable among findings not previously reported were associations of several antibiotics, both oral and topical, with lung cancer. These associations could not be explained by indications for drug use or by differences in smoking habits between users and nonusers, and suggest a possible link between the occurrence of bacterial infections and risk for cancer. In general, our results continue to suggest that most medications used during that period did not affect cancer incidence substantially. However, for less frequently prescribed medications, our power to detect moderate increases in cancer risk was quite low."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Oakland, California 94611."}], "LastName": "Selby", "ForeName": "J V", "Initials": "JV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Friedman", "ForeName": "G D", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Fireman", "ForeName": "B H", "Initials": "BH"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "R37-CA-19939", "Acronym": "CA", "Agency": "NCI NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Cancer Res", "NlmUniqueID": "2984705R", "ISSNLinking": "0008-5472"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Piperidones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfathiazoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vitamins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1306V2B0Q8", "NameOfSubstance": "Propantheline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1P7H87IN75", "NameOfSubstance": "Secobarbital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63937KV33D", "NameOfSubstance": "Erythromycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "935E97BOY8", "NameOfSubstance": "Folic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GN5P7K3T8S", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylbutazone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I16QD7X297", "NameOfSubstance": "Neomycin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J2VZ07J96K", "NameOfSubstance": "Polymyxin B"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Atropa belladonna"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Erythromycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Esophageal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Folic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lung Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced"], "DescriptorName": "Multiple Myeloma"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Neomycin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylbutazone"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Piperidones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Polymyxin B"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Propantheline"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Secobarbital"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfathiazoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vitamins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2571410"]}}]}
