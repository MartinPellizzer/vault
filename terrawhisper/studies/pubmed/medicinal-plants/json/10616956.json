Twenty-three local healers (n'ganga) in Chiawa, rural Zambia, were interviewed about knowledge, practices, and their use of indigenous plants in the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs) among male clients. They were also asked about their perceptions of modern medicine. The study revealed that all the n'ganga diagnosed and treated three main types of STIs. They named them as: songeya, doroba and bola-bola. They treated the illnesses with Strychnos cocculoides; Musa species; Solanum delegoense; Ximenia caffra; Diplorynchus condylocarpon; and Croton megalobotrys. Ten of the n'ganga perceived modern medicine to be effective against STIs and five of them sometimes referred some of the clients to the local health centre. It is being argued that a scheme to incorporate the n'ganga into STD control activities in which they can be utilised to refer clients to modern medical facilities can be beneficial. Given the necessary health information and support, the n'ganga may effectively execute this scheme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Economic and Social Research (former Institute of African Studies), University of Zambia, Lusaka."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ndubani", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "H\u00f6jer", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Clinical Competence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services, Indigenous"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Health"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "diagnosis", "therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sexually Transmitted Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zambia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10616956", "10.1016/s0378-8741(99)00075-6", "S0378874199000756"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
