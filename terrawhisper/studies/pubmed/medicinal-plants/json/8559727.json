In Experiment 1, diets contained 0, 7.5, 15, and 22.5% raw V. Compared with the control, the 22.5% V diet decreased (P < .05) BW, FI, and EP. In Experiment 2, intact or ground (G) V were either soaked (S) in water (1:5) for 24 h or autoclaved (A) at 103.5 x 10(3) Pa for 8 h, and then dried (D) at 55 C for 24 h. Eight diets were used, a corn soybean (control) and seven others, each containing 25% V, previously subjected to the forementioned treatments as follows: untreated V (UV), SDV, GSDV, ADV, GADV, SADV, and GSADV. Compared with the control, the UV diet decreased (P < .05) FI (75 vs 98 g) and EP (47.3 vs 88.7%), increased FC (1.99 vs 1.4 kg feed per dozen eggs), and induced BW loss (-63 vs 49 g). Soaking intact V improved (P < .05) FI (85 g) and EP (69%). Remaining treatments resulted in further improvement. Hens fed all V diets produced eggs with HU score 13 points better than that of the control (P < .05). In both experiments, EW, YC, and ST were not different among treatments. Results indicated that autoclaved V at 25% level was not detrimental to layers' performance."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, American University of Beirut, Lebanon."}], "LastName": "Farran", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Uwayjan", "ForeName": "M G", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Miski", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sleiman", "ForeName": "F T", "Initials": "FT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Adada", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ashkarian", "ForeName": "V M", "Initials": "VM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "O P", "Initials": "OP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Eggs"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8559727", "10.3382/ps.0741630", "S0032-5791(19)45542-9"]}}]}
