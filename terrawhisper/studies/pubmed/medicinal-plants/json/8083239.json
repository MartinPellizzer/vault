Inhibition by NEM approximates pseudo-first order kinetics and double-log plots of the first order rate constant for inactivation versus NEM concentration yield a straight line relationship with a slope of approximately unity. Since NEM and the membrane-impermeant cysteine reagent 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) inhibit the V-PPase with similar kinetics and compete for a common binding site on the M(r) = 66,000 substrate-binding subunit, a single residue located in a cytosolically disposed extramembranous domain is inferred to undergo covalent modification in both cases. Selective labeling of the V-PPase of vacuolar membrane vesicles with [14C]NEM, purification of the M(r) = 66,000 subunit, and its digestion with V8 protease generates multiple peptide fragments. Of the bands identified after electrophoresis of the digests on Tris-Tricine gels, only one, migrating at M(r) = 14,000 (V814K), contains 14C label. Gas-phase sequence analysis of this band after electrotransfer to Immobilon PSQ yields two overlapping sequences (V814K2 and V814K2) which unambiguously align with the carboxyl-terminal segment of the M(r) = 66,000 subunit. Both V814K1 and V814K2 encompass only 1 cysteine residue at position 634 which is conserved between the V-PPases from Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris (isoforms 1 and 2), and Hordeum vulgare. On the basis of these findings, the strict conservation of the sequence of the V-PPase from multiple plant sources, and the identical kinetics of interaction of the enzymes from Vigna and Beta with NEM and MPB, Cys634 of putative hydrophilic loop X is concluded to be the cytosolically oriented residue whose alkylation by maleimides is responsible for inactivation of the V-PPase. The significance of these results with respect to earlier speculations concerning the identity of the catalytic site and topology of the V-PPase is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104-6018."}], "LastName": "Zhen", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "E J", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rea", "ForeName": "P A", "Initials": "PA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Biol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985121R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9258"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Serine Endopeptidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.19", "NameOfSubstance": "glutamyl endopeptidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Inorganic Pyrophosphatase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "O3C74ACM9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylmaleimide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Membrane"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylmaleimide"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inorganic Pyrophosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Fragments"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrophosphatases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Serine Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Vacuoles"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8083239", "S0021-9258(17)31659-9"]}}]}
