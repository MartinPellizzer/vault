In the present study seven of these crude drugs, namely Francoeuria crispa, Hammada elegans, Malus pumila, Ruta chalepensis, Smilax sarsaparilla, Achillea fragrantissima and Alpinia officinarum were tested against carrageenan-induced acute inflammation in rats. The plant materials were extracted with 96% ethanol. The dried extract was dissolved in water for pharmacological testing. The rats were administered an oral dose of 500 mg/kg body weight of each extract 1 h prior to production of inflammation by carrageenan injection (0.05 ml of 1% carrageenan suspension in the planter aponeurosis of the right hind foot). The paw volume was measured at 0,2,3 and 4 h after the injection. Four of the seven plants, namely Francoeuria crispa (24%), Malus pumila (23%), Ruta chalepensis (30%) and Smilax sarsaparilla (25%), produced significant inhibition of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. These plants also inhibited cotton pellet-induced exudation. Further studies are suggested to isolate the active principles and for the determination of the mechanism of action of these drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "Ageel", "ForeName": "A M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mossa", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "al-Yahya", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "al-Said", "ForeName": "M S", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Drugs Exp Clin Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7802135", "ISSNLinking": "0378-6501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9000-07-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Carrageenan"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carrageenan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gossypium"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Granuloma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2598777"]}}]}
