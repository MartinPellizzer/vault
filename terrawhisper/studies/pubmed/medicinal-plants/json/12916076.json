Furthermore, the effect of papaverine was also considered on DAGO (highly selective mu -agonist) and U50-488H (highly selective k-agonist) withdrawal to test whether the possible interaction of papaverine on opioid withdrawal involves mu - and/or k-opioid receptors. Following a 4 min in vitro exposure to opioid agonist, the guinea-pig isolated ileum exhibited a strong contracture after the addition of naloxone. Papaverine treatment (1 x 10(-7) - 5 x 10(-7) - 1 x 10(-6) M) before or after the opioid agonists was able of both preventing and reversing the naloxone-induced contracture after exposure to mu (morphine and DAGO) or k (U50-488H) opiate agonists in a concentration-dependent fascion. Both acetylcholine response and electrical stimulation were not affected by papaverine treatment whereas the final opiate withdrawal was still reduced. The results of the present study indicate that papaverine was able to produce significative influence on the opiate withdrawal in vitro and papaverine was able to exert its effect both at mu and k opioid agonists."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Salerno, Fisciano (Salerno), Italy."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Capasso", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Loizzo", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Narcotic Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "100929-53-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-"}, {"RegistryNumber": "67198-13-4", "NameOfSubstance": "3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-Isomer"}, {"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DAA13NKG2Q", "NameOfSubstance": "Papaverine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl)-benzeneacetamide, (trans)-Isomer"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guinea Pigs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Smooth"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Narcotic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Papaverine"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Parasympatholytics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "14", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12916076", "10.1002/ptr.1234"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
