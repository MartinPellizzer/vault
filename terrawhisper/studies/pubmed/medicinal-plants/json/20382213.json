Because of the devastating nature of the disease there is an urgent need to develop new drugs or vaccines for the treatment, prevention and management of the disease. The objective of the present study was to collect and document information on herbal remedies traditionally used for the treatment of malaria in the Dangme West District of Ghana.", "Data was collected from 67 indigenous households in ten communities in the district using a validated questionnaire.", "In total, 30 species of plants belonging to 28 genera in 20 families were reported to be used in the preparation of the herbal remedies. Mature leaves were the most (55%) common plant part used and 73.3% of the herbal remedies involved a single plant. Most of the herbal remedies were prepared by boiling and administered orally. The majority (47%) of the species of plants used were collected from their compounds or home gardens.", "Knowledge about malaria and treatment practices exists in the study area. Herbal remedies were commonly used by people for the treatment of malaria because they were cost-effective. They are also more accessible. Many of the species of plants used have been documented for the treatment of malaria as well as investigated for their phytochemical and antimalarial and/or antiplasmodial activity confirming the results of previous studies as well as rationalization of their traditional use. Five species of plants used in the study area, namely, Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. ex J.C. Wendl. (Poaceae), Deinbollia pinnata Schum. &Thonn. (Sapindaceae), Elaeis guineensis Jacq. (Arecaceae), Greenwayodendron sp. (Annonaceae) and Solanum torvum Sw (Solanaceae), are documented for the first time for their use in the treatment of malaria. \"The result of this study provides the basis for further pharmacological studies on the herbal remedies used\"."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
