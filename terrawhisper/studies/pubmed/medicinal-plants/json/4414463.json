Both philosophically and practically treatment begins at the time of laminaria insertion which, by the authors' admission, has a lag period of 14-19 hours prior to drug administration. In the present program the patient was admitted overnight, indicating at least a 2 day hospital stay. In addition, insertion of a laminaria tent for a period this long might initiate an ongoing infective process. There is no question that insertion of the tents is in itself an abortifacient maneuver, meaning that cumulative abortion rate rigures--such as those which appear in the article--are misleading. Preparation of the figure to show the time span from insertion of the laminaria to abortion would clarify this point."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["002445", "00087180"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Biology", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Endocrine System", "Health", "Health Services", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Medicine", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal--administraction and dosage", "Prostaglandins--administraction and dosage"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "4414463", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1974", "Month": "12", "Day": "19"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "01", "Day": "09"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0002-9378", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "120", "Issue": "4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1974", "Month": "Oct", "Day": "15"}}, "Title": "American journal of obstetrics and gynecology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Am J Obstet Gynecol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Letter: Use of laminaria tents with prostaglandin.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "570", "EndPage": "571", "MedlinePgn": "570-1"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corson", "ForeName": "S L", "Initials": "SL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Obstet Gynecol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370476", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9378"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortion, Induced"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cervix Uteri"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seaweed"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1974", "Month": "10", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "1974", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1974", "Month": "10", "Day": "15", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4414463", "10.1016/0002-9378(74)90651-6", "0002-9378(74)90651-6"]}}]}
