SGC-7901 cells were randomly divided into control group, ESL-treated groups (12.5 g/L, 25 g/L, 50 g/L) and the positive control (25 mg/L DDP) group. The growth inhibitory rate was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological changes of apoptosis were observed with fluorescence microscope. Cell apoptosis rate was determined by flow cytometry. Expressions of bcl-xl, Caspase-9 and bid mRNA were detected by semi-quantitive RT-PCR. The activity of Caspase-3 was detected by Fluorospectrophotometry.", "Compared with control group, the cell proliferation inhibitory rate and apoptosis rate of human stomach cancer SGC-7901 cells increased obviously (P < 0.05). There were obvious changes of morphology of the SGC-7901 cells as the nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation and margination; The expression of bcl-xl mRNA decreased obviously (P < 0.05), the expression of Caspase-9 and bid mRNA increased obviously respectively (P < 0.05), and displayed effect in a dose-dependent manner in the SGC-7901 cells of the ESL-treated groups. The activity of Caspase-3 in the SGC-7901 cells of the ESL-treated groups were higher than that of the control group significantly (P < 0.01).", "ESL can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of the human stomach cancer SGC-7901 cells by regulating expression of bcl-xl, Caspase-9 and bid genes and strengthening the activity of Caspase-3."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, China. wanfs01@163.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "Fu-sheng", "Initials": "FS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Jian", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Shuo", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Le-han", "Initials": "LH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "bcl-X Protein"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q20Q21Q62J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cisplatin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cisplatin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Solanum"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Stomach Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "bcl-X Protein"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "9", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19504972"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
