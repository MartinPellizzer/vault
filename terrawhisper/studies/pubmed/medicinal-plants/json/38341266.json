Here, 10 endophytic fungi isolated from roots of wild Alkanna tinctoria plants and 5 AMF purchased from the Glomeromycota in vitro collection were evaluated, during two successive three-month greenhouse experiments, on the growth of Echium vulgare and alkannin/shikonin and their derivatives (A/Sd) production in the roots. Some of the endophytic fungi tested significantly increased plant growth parameters as compared to the control: Cladosporium allicinum, Cadophora sp., Clonostachys sp., Trichoderma hispanicum and Leptosphaeria ladina increased root volume, Plectosphaerella sp. And T. hispanicum root fresh weight and root water retention and T. hispanicum plant water retention. However, none of these fungi impacted A/Sd production. Conversely, none of the AMF strains tested impacted plant growth parameters, but those inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices MUCL 49410 had a significantly higher concentration of alkannin/shikonin (A/S), acetyl-A/S, \u03b2,\u03b2- dimethylacryl-A/S, isovaleryl-A/S and total A/Sd, compared to the control plants. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the production of A/Sd in plants associated to specific endophytic fungi/AMF and on the cultivation conditions required for optimal production of these compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 British Mycological Society.
