Among them, the BODIPY-tetrazine derivative 6i was stable towards long-term storage and red-emitting with excellent performance, and was further used to image <i>trans</i>-cyclooctene-labeled lipids in mammalian cells and cyclopropene-labeled sugars in cancer cells under no-wash conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China. liyongjun026@gmc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Science of Shaanxi Province, Key laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Chang'an Campus: No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an, Xi'an, 710119, China. junyang@snnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China. liyongjun026@gmc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Macromolecular Science of Shaanxi Province, Key laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Chang'an Campus: No. 620, West Chang'an Avenue, Chang'an, Xi'an, 710119, China. junyang@snnu.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China. liyongjun026@gmc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongjun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6884-6166"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Engineering Research Center for the Development and Application of Ethnic Medicine and TCM (Ministry of Education), Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China. liyongjun026@gmc.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Chem Commun (Camb)", "NlmUniqueID": "9610838", "ISSNLinking": "1359-7345"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2,4,5-tetrazine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aza Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Boron Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorescent Dyes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "A549 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aza Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Benzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Boron Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorescent Dyes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Optical Imaging"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34889325", "10.1039/d1cc05863k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
