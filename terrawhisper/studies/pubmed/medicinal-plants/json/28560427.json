Harms, a plant widely used in traditional oriental medicine. The present study investigated the anti\u2011inflammatory effects of AS II using murine macrophages. The effects of AS II on inflammatory mediator and cytokine production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)\u2011stimulated RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated. Nitric oxide (NO) and cytokine production were determined using the Griess reagent and an ELISA kit. The expression levels of cytokines, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase\u20112 (COX\u20112) mRNA were examined by reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression levels of iNOS, COX\u20112 and toll\u2011like receptor (TLR)\u20114 protein were examined by western blotting. Translocation of nuclear factor\u2011\u03baB (NF\u2011\u03baB) and TLR\u20114 expression were visualized by immunofluorescence staining. AS II markedly inhibited the production of NO and prostaglandin E2, and reduced iNOS and COX\u20112 expression at the transcriptional and translational levels. AS II downregulated the expression of interleukin\u20116 and tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 at the protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, pre\u2011treatment with AS II significantly suppressed the TLR\u20114\u2011NF\u2011\u03baB signaling pathway; this effect may be cause by AS II competing with LPS for binding to TLR\u20114 and subsequently inhibiting translocation of the NF\u2011\u03baB/p65 protein to the nucleus. The results suggested that the anti\u2011inflammatory properties of AS II may result from inhibiting pro\u2011inflammatory mediators by suppressing the initiation of the inflammatory response and inhibiting TLR-4-NF-\u03baB signaling pathways."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Oriental Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Wonkwang Oriental Medicines Research Institute, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeollabuk 570749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Seo", "ForeName": "Yun-Soo", "Initials": "YS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Professional Graduate School of Oriental Medicine, Department of Third Medicine, Wonkwang University, Iksan, Jeollabuk 570749, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seok-Jeon", "Initials": "SJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Hunan University of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan 410208, P.R.
