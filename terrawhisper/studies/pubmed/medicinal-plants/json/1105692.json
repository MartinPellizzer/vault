The proportion of patients requiring second amniocentesis was also minimized, as was the probability of serious cervical trauma. The present study evaluates the use of laminaria with intraamniotic PGF2a as the method of choice for midtrimester abortion service. 243 pregnant women, including the 11 in the pilot study, 16-20 weeks from last menstrual period, requested abortion by laminaria pretreatment before PGF2a infusion. The patients were divided into 1) initial group (n=20) treated with PGF2a alone; 2) pretreatment group with laminaria before PGF2a (n=230); and 3) group treated with simultaneous laminaria and PGF2a (n=26). The pretreatment group had a mean infusion to abortion interval of 14.3 hours, with a low incidence of gastrointestinal and other side effects. The simultaneously treated group had a mean infusion to abortion interval of 18.6 hours. In the pretreated group, infusion to abortion interval was indirectly related to the number of laminaria inserted rather than nulliparity or parity of the women. Transient fetal survival is more frequent with prostaglandin than with hypertonic saline for abortion, and retained placenta and resultant blood loss remains a problem. Further research should be done to establish the safety of laminaria pretreatment and PGF2a for abortion."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["002951", "00088068"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: PROSTAGLANDINS."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Induced", "Amniocentesis", "Biology", "Cervical Dilatation", "Clinical Research", "Demographic Factors", "Endocrine System", "Family Planning", "Fertility", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Fertility Measurements", "Lactation", "Laminaria Tents", "Nulliparity", "Parity", "Physiology", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Population Dynamics", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Second Trimester", "Prostaglandins", "Reproduction", "Research Methodology", "Saline Solution, Hypertonic", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "1105692", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1976", "Month": "02", "Day": "26"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2019", "Month": "08", "Day": "23"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0090-6980", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1975", "Month": "Sep"}}, "Title": "Prostaglandins", "ISOAbbreviation": "Prostaglandins"}, "ArticleTitle": "Laminaria augmentation of intra-amniotic PGF2 for midtrimester pregnancy termination.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "413", "EndPage": "422", "MedlinePgn": "413-22"}, "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["In our hands, intra-amniotic PGF2alpha 40 mg for midtrimester pregnancy termination had a mean infusion to abortion interval of 29.4 hr.
