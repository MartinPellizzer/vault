Ewes and their twin-reared lambs were placed in paddocks on d 19; ewes were removed on d 28. In Trial 1, 60 lambs were allocated to three treatments: unweaned controls (CON1), lambs weaned onto first-cut alfalfa either without supplementary grain (WOG) or with up to 270 g.hd-1.d-1 supplementary grain (WG). Daily gains for the CON1, WOG and WG lambs were 309, 118 and 159 g for the period from d 28 to 40 (P greater than .05) and 241, 195 and 245 g for the period from d 40 to 56 (P greater than .05), respectively. In Trial 2, 80 lambs were allocated to four treatments: weaning onto first-cut alfalfa (early alfalfa, EA), second-cut alfalfa (late alfalfa, LA) birdsfoot trefoil (BFT) and unweaned controls (CON2, pastured on second-cut alfalfa). Daily gains for CON2 lambs were greater (P less than .05) than gains of EA and LA lambs (327 vs 136 and 136 g, respectively) for d 28 to 40, but not different (P greater than .05) for d 40 to 56 (245, 227 and 195 g, respectively). Gains for BFT lambs were lower (P less than .05) than for CON2 lambs for both periods (122 and 136 g, respectively), and BFT lambs appeared to be unthrifty after weaning. By d 32, weaning caused plasma glucose to decline 16.0 mg/dl and plasma nonesterified fatty acids to increase 365 mu eq/liter from preweaning levels. Hematocrit values ranged from 31 to 35% (Trial 1) and 25 to 29% (Trial 2), suggesting that the weaned lambs did not suffer from dehydration. Crossbred lambs can be weaned at 28 d of age directly onto first-cut or second-cut alfalfa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Meat and Anim.
