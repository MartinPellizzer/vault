Analytical centrifugation in a self-generated CsCl density gradient revealed the occurrence of a heavy satellite DNA band (p = 1.712 g X cm-3) in addition to the main DNA band (p = 1.696 g X cm-3) in the DNA preparation extracted from GA3-treated seedlings, that could not be detected in the DNA isolated from untreated plants. The existence of this GC-rich DNA fraction was additionally confirmed by means of derivative DNA melting profiles. Comparison of the reassociation kinetics obtained for control DNA with DNA from GA3-treated plants showed changes in the percentage distribution of three main DNA sequence classes, with different repetition frequency in the haploid pea genome. It is postulated that such a variation in the percentage of different C0t families might reflect the selective DNA replication evoked by hormonal treatment of dwarf pea plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wasilewska", "ForeName": "L D", "Initials": "LD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bralczyk", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mazurkiewicz", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biochim Pol", "NlmUniqueID": "14520300R", "ISSNLinking": "0001-527X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Gibberellins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gibberellins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nucleic Acid Hybridization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6720195"]}}]}
