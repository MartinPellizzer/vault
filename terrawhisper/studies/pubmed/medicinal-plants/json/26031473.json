Our investigation added new data to the traditional knowledge on the plant uses in Italian alpine areas, where only in recent years the awareness of losing such valuable heritage stimulated interest of the scientific community and land managers in its recovery and enhancement. To this end, the present study aimed to collect and analyse information on plant species employed in Northern Italy (Lombardy Region), particularly in Alta Valtellina, an area of high naturalistic interest, where ethnobotanical knowledge is at the risk of passing covering a secondary role compared to other aspects of the local culture.", "A total of 328 people from six municipalities were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Data were evaluated by quantitative parameters such as ethnobotanicity and ethnophytonomic indices, factor informant consensus (Fic), fidelity level (Fl). Abandoned and current uses were compared. Herbarium materials were prepared and conserved.", "Inhabitants of Alta Valtellina used 212 plant species, including 19 mushrooms and 1 lichen for medicinal, food and cosmetic purposes. Despite half of medicinal uses has fallen into disuse, the plant species of this category were still collected in largest number. Digestive, respiratory and skin systems were the most frequently treated. Fic and Fl values, in addition to simple percentage data confirmed this finding. Although 40% of the known uses is now abandoned, a considerable number of them was recorded for the first time in an alpine area.", "The study revealed that the popular knowledge of plant species is still alive in the Alta Valtellina. The prerogatives of some species are now outdated, but they leave room for other uses of the plant resources that may provide new opportunities from the scientific, cultural and economic points of view."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
