This review emphasizes medicinal food plants and their isolated chemicals inhibiting clinically important enzymes in common diseases. A mechanistic overview was investigated to explain the mechanism of these food bases enzyme inhibitors. The enzyme inhibition potential of medicinal food plants and their isolated substances was searched in Ovid, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Cholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, xanthine oxidase, tyrosinase, urease, lipoxygenase, and others were inhibited by crude extracts, solvent fractions, or isolated pure chemicals from medicinal food plants. Several natural compounds have shown tyrosinase inhibition potential, including quercetin, glabridin, phloretin-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, lupinalbin, and others. Some of these compounds' inhibitory kinetics and molecular mechanisms are also discussed. Phenolics and flavonoids inhibit enzyme activity best among the secondary metabolites investigated. Several studies showed flavonoids' significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, highlighting their medicinal potential. Overall, many medicinal food plants, their crude extracts/fractions, and isolated compounds have been studied, and some promising compounds depending on the enzyme have been found. Still, more studies are recommended to derive potential pharmacologically active functional foods."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary & Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Saleem", "ForeName": "Hammad", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fatima Memorial Medical and Dental College, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Yaqub", "ForeName": "Anam", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Multan Medical & Dental College, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rafique", "ForeName": "Rabiya", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (IPS), University of Veterinary & Animal Sciences (UVAS), Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ali Chohan", "ForeName": "Tahir", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Peoples University of Medical and Health Sciences, NawabShah, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Malik", "ForeName": "Durr-E-Shahwar", "Initials": "DE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Division of Science and Technology, University of Education Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tousif", "ForeName": "Muhammad Imran", "Initials": "MI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Khurshid", "ForeName": "Umair", "Initials": "U"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Monash University Malaysia, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Ahemad", "ForeName": "Nafees", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Marine Biomedical Research Lab & Environmental Toxicology Unit, Department of Prosthodotics, Saveetha Dental College and Hospitals, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences, Saveetha University, Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Ramasubburayan", "ForeName": "Ramasamy", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Natural Products and Medicinal Chemistry (LNPMC), Department of Pharmacology, Saveetha Dental College, Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMATS), Chennai, India."}], "LastName": "Rengasamy", "ForeName": "Kannan Rr", "Initials": "KR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "11"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37255100", "10.1080/10408398.2023.2217264"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
