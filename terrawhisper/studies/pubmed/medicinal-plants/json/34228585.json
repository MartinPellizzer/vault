Numerous therapeutic options are available, which controls the plasma glucose levels. However, most of the drugs are associated with some undesired side effects. Owing to the side effects and enhanced understanding of the phytochemicals, an inclination toward herbal medicine is seen in the population. These herbal products are also associated with concerns like poor aqueous solubility, compromised permeation, and a low degree of bioavailability. So, the emergence of nanotechnology in the herbal medicine is required to nullify the associated concerns of conventional antidiabetic drugs. The present review aims to compile the literature available for the nano-interventions pertinent to herbal products for diabetes management."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, India."}], "LastName": "Paul", "ForeName": "Rakesh Kumar", "Initials": "RK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0890-769X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India."}], "LastName": "Kesharwani", "ForeName": "Prashant", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8159-8005"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmacy, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, India."}], "LastName": "Raza", "ForeName": "Kaisar", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biomater Sci Polym Ed", "NlmUniqueID": "9007393", "ISSNLinking": "0920-5063"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Delivery Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34228585", "10.1080/09205063.2021.1952381"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
