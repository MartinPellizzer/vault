One LED array supplied 100% of the photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) at 660 nm, a second array supplied 90% of the PPF at 660 nm and 10% at 735 nm, and a third array supplied 98% of the PPF at 660 nm with 2% in the blue region (380-500 nm) supplied by blue fluorescent lamps. Control plants were grown under metal halide (MH) lamps. Pepper plants inoculated with ToMV and grown under 660 and 660/735 LED arrays showed marked increases in both the rate and the severity of symptoms as compared to inoculated plants grown under the MH lamp or 660/blue array. Pepper plants grown under the 660/blue array did not develop symptoms as rapidly as inoculated plants grown under the 660 or 660/735 arrays, but they did develop symptoms faster than inoculated plants grown under the MH lamp. The numbers of colonies of powdery mildew per leaf and the size of each colony were greatest on inoculated cucumber plants grown under the MH lamp."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Agriculture Office, EPCOT Center, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830, USA."}], "LastName": "Schuerger", "ForeName": "A C", "Initials": "AC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Brown", "ForeName": "C S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Adv Space Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9878935", "ISSNLinking": "0273-1177"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["radiation effects", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cucumis sativus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecological Systems, Closed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Life Support Systems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lighting"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11540212", "10.1016/0273-1177(94)90327-1"]}}]}
