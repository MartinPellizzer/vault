The pharmaceutical evaluation of toothpaste was carried out as per the US Government Tooth Paste Specifications. A 4-week clinical study was conducted in patients with oro-dental problems to evaluate the plaque removing efficacy of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste with commercially available chlorhexidine gluconate (0.2% w/v) mouthwash as positive control. Total microbial count was carried out to determine the percentage decrease in the oral bacterial count over the period of treatment.", "Herbal extracts were found to possess satisfactory antimicrobial activity against most of the dental pathogens. Chitosan-containing polyherbal toothpaste significantly reduces the plaque index by 70.47% and bacterial count by 85.29%, and thus fulfills the majority of esthetic and medicinal requirements of oral hygiene products.", "Chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste proves itself as a promising novel oral hygiene product as compared with currently available oral hygiene products. A further study to confirm the exact mechanism and active constituents behind antiplaque and antimicrobial activity of chitosan-based polyherbal toothpaste and its efficacy in large number of patient population is on high demand."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Government College of Pharmacy, Vidyanagar, Karad, District- Satara, Maharashtra, India. nitinmohire123@rediffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohire", "ForeName": "Nitin C", "Initials": "NC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "Adhikrao V", "Initials": "AV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Dent Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9202990", "ISSNLinking": "0970-9290"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mouthwashes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toothpastes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9012-76-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Chitosan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "MOR84MUD8E", "NameOfSubstance": "chlorhexidine gluconate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R4KO0DY52L", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorhexidine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents, Local"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacterial Load"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Biocompatible Materials"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chitosan"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorhexidine"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Plaque Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Escherichia coli"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lactobacillus acidophilus"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Mouthwashes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Hygiene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Proteus vulgaris"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pterocarpus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Toothpastes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20930349", "10.4103/0970-9290.70808", "IndianJDentRes_2010_21_3_380_70808"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
