HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines were used to test the obtained compounds for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities. Compound 15 (2-(3,7-Dimethyl-2,6-dioxo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-1-yl)-N-(4-(1-(2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)hydrazono)ethyl) phenyl)acetamide) was the most potent cytotoxic member against MCF-7 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.42\u00a0\u00b5M) and HepG2 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.22\u00a0\u00b5M). The effectiveness of VEGFR-2 inhibition was assessed for compound 15, and its IC<sub>50</sub> value was calculated to be 0.067\u00a0\u00b5M. Additional cellular mechanistic investigations showed that compound 15 dramatically increased the population of apoptotic HepG2 cells in both early and late apoptosis. The investigation of apoptotic markers confirmed that compound 15 upregulated the levels of BAX (2.26-fold) and downregulated the levels of Bcl-2 (4.4-fold). The molecular docking investigations, MM-GPSA, PLIP studies, and MD simulations validated the potential of compound 15 to be a VEGFR-2 inhibitor. DFT calculations have been completed to comprehend how the electrical charge is distributed within compound 15 and to predict how it would bond to VEGFR-2. Lastly, ADMET prediction showed that the designed members have drug-like characteristics and minimal levels of toxicity. In conclusion, our in vitro and in silico investigations showed that compound 15 exhibited promising apoptotic anticancer potential through the suppression of VEGFR-2."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
