Koch (Asteraceae) is widely found in different parts of Iran. This plant is full of flavonoids and sesquiterpene lactones, which have been shown to be effective in lowering blood lipids and hypertension. We conducted a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial to study the antihyperlipidemic and antihypertensive effects of Achillea drops. We randomly selected 120 men and women, aged 40-60 years, and divided them in two distinct groups of moderate hyperlipidemic and primary hypertensive subjects. They were treated either with hydroalcoholic extract or with placebo in the form of 15-20 drops twice daily for more than 6 months. Blood pressure and serum lipids (total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol) were measured in the groups for 3 periods of 2 months each. The mean and standard deviation of alternations in these variables between the group taking placebo and that taking drugs was calculated by Student's t-test. The results showed a significant decrease in triglycerides after of 2 months while decreases in triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significant after 4 months. Levels of HDL-cholesterol were significantly increased after 6 months' treatment. A significant decrease was observed in diastolic and systolic blood pressure after 2 and 6 months, respectively (p < 0.05)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran. isf.carvascrc@asia-mail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Asgary", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naderi", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sarrafzadegan", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohammadifard", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mostafavi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vakili", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Drugs Exp Clin Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7802135", "ISSNLinking": "0378-6501"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antihypertensive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperlipidemias"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Hypolipidemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10941601"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
