The red blood cells of rats were physically investigated in this work after whole body irradiation by 7\u00a0Gy of gamma rays and trying for reducing the damage effect of ionizing radiation by using the one of the best medicinal plants, Moringa leaves, which are rich with plentiful amounts of antioxidants and nutrients. The animals were divided into six groups; control, Moringa, irradiated, protected, treated, pro-treated. The physical parameters measured were impedance and DC conductivity then, relaxation time, activation energy and enthalpy change were calculated. Most of these parameters showed that the damage occurred in RBCs membrane due to ionizing radiation needs more than four weeks after irradiation to recover. As dipolar relaxation required much more time to occur and charge conduction were greatly reduced."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
