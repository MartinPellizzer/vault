The spines of G. sinensis development process is divided into formation period (the beginning of August to the beginning of November), dormant period (the beginning of November to the end of March in the following year), germination period (the end of March to the middle of April), fast growth period (the middle of April to the middle of August), browning period (the middle of August to the end of August) and mature period (the beginning of September to the end of December). Formation period the spines primordium divides and forms the scale bubs; dormant period the scale bubs are in a dormant state; germination period the bubs scales fall off, spines primordium began to development; fast growth period rapid growth to maximum; browning period browning from the tip and browns until the whole becomes brown; mature period The early stage of maturity is full of luster, gradually the color deepened and the luster faded. The accumulation of quercetin was gradually decreasing after increasing. The total polyphenol accumulation was significantly decreased and then gradually increased, decreased finally. The content of quercetin was increased from 0.000 4%-0.002 6%, and the polyphenol content decreased from 0.761 9%-0.049 1% and then slowly increased to 0.286 9% in the fast growth period.The quercetin continuous increase to 0.004 3% and total polyphenol increased to 0.421 6% in the browning period. In the mature period, the quercetin content significantly decreased after reaching 0.009 6% in September, and the polyphenols content decreased after reaching 0.723 5% in October. Using principal component analysis results: September first, October 2nd, November 3rd. The morphological characteristics change of the development process and quercetin and polyphenols accumulation were determined. The development process is divided into six periods, the best harvest time is the early stage of mature period.
