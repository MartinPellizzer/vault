A 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was computed. Sulforhodamine B and neutral red assays were used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the cytotoxicity of extracts to C1008 cells, and to compute a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC(50)) using a dose response curve.", "Eight of the 31 plant species assayed showed significant antiviral activity against HSV 1 and HSV 2 viruses. The acetone extract of Kalanchoe pinnata Pers. (Crassulaceae) produced an IC(50) of 0.025 mg/mL and a CC(50) of 1.25 mg/mL yielding a therapeutic index of 50. Additionally, this extract reduced plaque numbers to zero or near zero at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL when added 30 min before or 30 min after virus infection.", "The mechanism of inhibition against HSV 1 and HSV 2 viruses is now being investigated, along with fractionation of the acetone extract in search of the active compound or compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Laboratory, Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jaeger Greer", "ForeName": "Mary R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cates", "ForeName": "Rex G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Johnson", "ForeName": "F Brent", "Initials": "FB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lamnaouer", "ForeName": "Driss", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ohai", "ForeName": "Levon", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Discovery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hawaii"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Simplex"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 2, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Kalanchoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morocco"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Southwestern United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Viral Plaque Assay"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2011", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20731556", "10.3109/13880200903468873"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
