Dried plant material was extracted with boiling 1% tartaric acid in methanol for 2 h on an electric basket and crude extracts purified with cation-exchange solid phase extraction (CE-SPE). Purified extracts containing alkaloids were separated on Zorbax SB RP18 stationary phase in gradient of 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The flow rate was 0.25 mL/min and was suitable both for DAD and EI MS detections. Applied gradient procedure permitted quite sufficient separation of PAs in various plant extracts. On the basis of EI MS spectra, toxic PAs with unsaturated 1,2-double bond in the necine moiety were found in all plant materials and in nine of them (excluding only Cynoglossum amabile) for the fi rst time. They included the following types of structures: 9- and 7-viridifloryl-retronecine monoesters, 9-angeloyl-7-viridifloryl-retronecine, 9-angeloyl-retronecine diester, 9-viridifloryl-retronecine saturated ester, 7-angeloyl-9-viridifloryl-retronecine, 7-angeloyl-9-echimidinyl-retronecine, trachelanthamine and others. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) chromatograms at m/z 119, 120 and 136 together with analysis of UV spectra from DAD detector can be applied in rapid screening for toxic PAs in new plant extracts but to obtain detailed structural information (molecular weight and stereochemistry) more expensive hyphenation is required. Consumption of all analysed plants should be avoided as carcinogenic and hepatotoxic properties of the alkaloids detected are expected."], "CopyrightInformation": "2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy with Medicinal Plants Laboratory, Medical University, 1 Chod6ki\u017aSt, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. tmroczek@pharmacognosy.org"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mroczek", "ForeName": "Tomasz", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baj", "ForeName": "Stefan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chrobok", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Glowniak", "ForeName": "Kazimierz", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "24", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15386579", "10.1002/bmc.388"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
