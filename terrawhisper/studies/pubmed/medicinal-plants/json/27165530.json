The plants were subjected to five levels of saline irrigation water, 0.37 (tap water as control) with 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 dSm(-1) of saline water. After two months the uniform plants were harvested for experimental analysis. Antioxidant enzymes activities and proline, phenol and anthocyanine contents of the plants were examinated. Enhanced activities of peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase were determined by increasing salinity that plays an important protective role in the ROS-scavenging process. Proline, phenol and anthocyanine contents increased significantly with increasing salinity. These results suggest that salinity tolerance of Hyssopus officinalis plants might be closely related with the increased capacity of antioxidative system to scavenge reactive oxygen species and with the accumulation of osmoprotectant proline, phenol and anthocyanine contents under salinity conditions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Kharazmi University , Postal Code 15719-14911, Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Jahantigh", "ForeName": "Omolbanin", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Kharazmi University , Postal Code 15719-14911, Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafi", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plants, Medicinal Plants Research Center, ACECR , Karaj , Iran."}], "LastName": "Badi", "ForeName": "Hassanali Naghdi", "Initials": "HN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Kharazmi University , Postal Code 15719-14911, Tehran , Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Science and Research Branch , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khavari-Nejad", "ForeName": "Ramazan Ali", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB) , Tehran , Iran."}], "LastName": "Sanjarian", "ForeName": "Forough", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8404358", "ISSNLinking": "0236-5383"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9DLQ4CIU6V", "NameOfSubstance": "Proline"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Hyssopus Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proline"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Salinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27165530", "10.1556/018.67.2016.2.7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
