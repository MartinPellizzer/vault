Indigenous knowledge on the management of \"African\" diseases using medicinal plants is still handed down orally from generation to generation by tribal societies of tropical Africa, and with the rapid westernization of these societies there is a pressing need to record local knowledge before it is lost forever.", "This study documented medicinal plant species associated with the management of \"African\" diseases by the local communities of Bwambara sub-county in Rukungiri district, Western Uganda.", "A cross-sectional study was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires and interviews. The data collected included names of plant species, plant parts used, diseases treated, methods of preparation, and mode of administration of the herbal remedies. A total of 196 informants participated in the study. Data were analyzed and presented using descriptive statistics and the Informant consensus factor.", "We documented 67 medicinal plant species distributed over 27 families and 62 genera. The most commonly reported species belong to Asteraceae family. The most frequently used medicinal species were Chenopodium opulifolium (27), Sesbania sesban (26), Thevetia peruviana (25), Leonotis nepetifolia (23), Momordica foetida (23), Euphorbia hirta (21) and Cassia mimosoides (20). Leaves were the most commonly used plants parts and decoctions were the main method of preparation. Water was the main medium used for the preparation of the remedies which were administered orally while petroleum jelly was the main medium for those which were used as ointments. The medicinal plant species reported are used to treat 39 conditions which were clustered into 10 International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) disease categories. There is a high degree of consensus among the informants on which medicinal plant species they use for different diseases especially disorders in the following categories: neurological (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.90), general and unspecified (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.87), digestive (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.86) and female genital (FIC\u00a0=\u00a00.82).", "Local communities of Bwambara sub-county in Rukungiri district, Western Uganda use a rich diversity of medicinal plant species in the management of various \"African\" diseases. Therefore, collaboration between users of medicinal plants and scientists is paramount, to help in the discovery of new drugs based on indigenous knowledge."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
