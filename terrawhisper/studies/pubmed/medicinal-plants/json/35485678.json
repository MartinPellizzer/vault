It has many biological and pharmacological activities. The present study aimed to identify the chemical constituents of the essential oil of Lavandula officinalis (LAEO) by using GC/MS analysis. Its genotoxicity, anti-genotoxicity and histopathological activities against the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide (CP) was investigated. The study also evaluated its anticancer activities against six human cancer cell lines: hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), Prostate (PC3), Lung carcinoma (A549), Skin cancer (A431), Colon cancer (HCT116) and Breast cancer (MCF7).", "The genotoxicity was determined using: micronucleus, chromosomal aberration, and comet assays. The histopathological study included liver. The examined groups were control negative, control plant, control positive (CP), and 3 combined groups received LAEO at different concentrations plus CP.", "GC/MS analysis recorded 16 components. The principals were: linalool and linalyl acetate. The results indicated the safety of LAEO. It also attenuates genotoxicity and deleterious histopathological effects of CP in a dose-dependent manner. LAEO has a highly cytotoxic effect on HepG2 and A549 cell lines with 100% death at 100\u00b5g/ ml with IC50 67.8 and 12 \u00b5g/ ml, respectively. Its activity on other cell lines was weak.", "The essential oil of Lavandula officinalis has anticancer and anti-mutagenic effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6772-4295"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Cytology, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Fahmy", "ForeName": "Maha A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-6082-9361"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Cytology, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Farghaly", "ForeName": "Ayman A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7999-4797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics and Cytology, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Entesar E", "Initials": "EE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5442-1722"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Emad M", "Initials": "EM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4917-6843"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Compounds Chemistry, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Zeinab M", "Initials": "ZM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1364-4951"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mahmoud", "ForeName": "Khaled", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9111-2339"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, National Research Centre (NRC), Dokki, Giza, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Omara", "ForeName": "Enayat A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Thailand", "MedlineTA": "Asian Pac J Cancer Prev", "NlmUniqueID": "101130625", "ISSNLinking": "1513-7368"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lavandula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}], "CoiStatement": "All the authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Amer SM, Ibrahim AAS, El-Sherbeny KM.
