Banhasasim-tang (BHSST), a traditional herbal medicines mixture, mainly used to treat GI-related diseases, may have a potential in IBS treatment. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain as the main clinical symptom, which seriously affects the quality of life.", "We conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of BHSST and its mechanisms of action in treating IBS.", "We evaluated the efficacy of BHSST in a zymosan-induced diarrhea-predominant animal model of IBS. Electrophysiological methods were used to confirm modulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) and voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (NaV) ion channels, which are associated mechanisms of action.", "Oral administration of BHSST decreased colon length, increased stool scores, and increased colon weight. Weight loss was also minimized without affecting food intake. In mice administered with BHSST, the mucosal thickness was suppressed, making it similar to that of normal mice, and the degree of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was severely reduced. These effects were similar to those of the anti-inflammatory drug-sulfasalazine-and antidepressant-amitriptyline. Moreover, pain-related behaviors were substantially reduced. Additionally, BHSST inhibited TRPA1, NaV1.5, and NaV1.7 ion channels associated with IBS-mediated visceral hypersensitivity.", "In summary, the findings suggest that BHSST has potential beneficial effects on IBS and diarrhea through the modulation of ion channels."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
