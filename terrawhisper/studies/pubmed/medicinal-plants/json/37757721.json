Nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as an effective strategy to raise plant productivity under current rapid environmental challenges. However, there is little literature on mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of re-watering in drought-stressed plants treated with NPs. In this study, the effects of cerium dioxide nanoparticles [(CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs), 0 (control), 125, 250, 500, and 1000\u00a0mL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>] were investigated on morpho-physiological and phytochemical traits of Salvia mirzayanii plants under different drought stress intensities [(25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% (control) of field capacity (FC) moisture] and post-stress re-watering (recovery) in a three-way factorial arrangement based on randomized complete block design. Uptake and accumulation of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs in the leaf tissue of plant samples were confirmed using SEM and EDX techniques. The results of ANOVA demonstrated that growth and physio-phytochemical traits were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) affected by individual treatment and/or their double and triple interactions. Exposure to various levels of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs during drought stress mitigated the adverse effects of stress on growth parameters (e.g., plant height, shoot and root dry weights, and root length) and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b) content compared to the respective controls in varying degrees. However, proline and essential oil content were increased in drought-stressed plants, and tended to decrease during the period of recovery. Before re-watering, the antioxidant enzymes, CAT, POD, and SOD, activity in leaf tissues was increased with the increase of drought stress intensity upon both treated and non-treated CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs conditions. However, the three-way interaction results demonstrated that recovery after drought stress following CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs application particularly 1000\u00a0mL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes compared to the controls. Based on GC and GC-MS analysis, all essential oil samples predominantly composed of oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes including Decane, Spathulenol, Octane, \u03b1-Terpinyl acetate, Hexyl isovalerate, Dodecane, Butanoic acid, Linalool, \u03b4-Cadinene, Muurolol, \u03b1-Cadinol, Eudesm-7(11)-en-4-ol, which significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) changed under different experimental treatments. The recovery after stress, however, increased only the content of \u03b4-Cadinene in plants from severe drought stress upon foliar application of 1000\u00a0mL\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs compared to the non-recovery period. Conclusively, integrative use of CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs and re-watering after drought stress could be an encouraging and eco-friendly strategy to improve both drought tolerance, growth and pyhtochemical contents in S. mirzayanii plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
