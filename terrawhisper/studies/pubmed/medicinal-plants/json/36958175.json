While the relapsing subtypes of MS are to some extent treatable, the disease remains incurable leading to progressive disability. Limited efficacy of current small molecule drugs necessitates development of efficient and safe MS medications. Accordingly, drug repurposing is an invaluable strategy that recognizes new targets for known drugs especially in the field of poorly addressed therapeutic areas. Drug discovery largely depends on the identification of potential binding molecules to the intended biomolecular target(s). In this regard, current study was devoted to in silico repurposing of 263 small molecule CNS drugs to achieve superior binders to some MS-related targets. On the basis of molecular docking scores, thioxanthene and benzisothiazole-based antipsychotics could be identified as potential binders to sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (S1PL) and cyclophilin D (CypD). Tightest interaction modes were observed for zuclopenthixol-S1PL (\u0394G<sub>b</sub> -7.96\u00a0kcal/mol) and lurasidone-CypD (\u0394G<sub>b</sub> -8.84\u00a0kcal/mol) complexes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations proved the appropriate and stable accommodation of top-ranked drugs inside enzyme binding sites during 100\u00a0ns. Hydroxyethyl piperazine of zuclopenthixol and benzisothiazole of lurasidone flipped inside the binding pocket to interact with adjacent polar and apolar residues. Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) fluctuations confirmed the results of binding trajectory analysis and showed that non-polar hydrophobic interactions played significant roles in acquired stabilities. Our results on lurasidone binding pattern were interestingly in accordance with previous reports on X-ray structures of other norbornane maleimide derivatives as CypD inhibitors. According to this, Asn144, Phe102 and Phe155 served as important residues in providing stable binding pose of lurasidone through both exo and endo conformations. Although experimental results are necessary to be achieved, the outcomes of this study proposed the potentiality of some thioxanthene and benzisothiazole-based antipsychotics for binding to S1PL and CypD, respectively, as MS-related targets."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
