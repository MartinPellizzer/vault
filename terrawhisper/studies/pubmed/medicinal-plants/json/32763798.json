The effects of different concentrations of benzyl adenine (BA), 6-phurphurylaminopurine (KIN), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) on shoot propagation and rooting of G. clusii were investigated. The optimal in vitro conditions for shoot propagation and long-term maintenance were achieved using woody plant medium (WPM) supplemented with 0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> KIN, and subsequent application of IBA at 0.5\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> significantly improved rooting of these shoots. Root culture was established from excised root tips cultured in \u00bd MS liquid media with increasing concentrations of IBA (0.1-1.0\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup>). A high root growth rate and considerable biomass yield were obtained by addition of 1.0\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> IBA. HPLC analysis revealed that in vitro culture considerably promoted the production of secondary metabolites in G. clusii. The selected protocol for shoot propagation (WPM\u00a0+\u00a00.5\u00a0mg\u00a0l<sup>-1</sup> KIN) increased the content of sweroside, gentiopicrin and norswertianin-1-O-primeveroside (N-1-P) for more than 2-fold compared with the wild plants. IBA promoted N-1-P and norswertianin production in root cultures; their contents were enhanced 6.4- and 18.6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild plants. The extract of these roots displayed the highest antioxidant capacity (IC<sub>50</sub>\u00a0=\u00a066.57\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml<sup>-1</sup>). The established shoot and root propagation protocols facilitate in vitro conservation of G. clusii, and provides a promising tool for the large scale production of valuable secoiridoids and xanthones."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.
