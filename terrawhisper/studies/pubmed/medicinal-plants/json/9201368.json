A total of 196 birch pollen-hypersensitive patients with oral allergy syndrome (OAS) caused by different vegetable foods were examined in the cross-sectional part of the study. Of this total, 195 patients had apple and/or hazelnut allergy, and 103 had Apiaceae sensitivity; only one patient had Apiaceae allergy alone. Apiaceae-positive patients showed significantly higher birch pollen-specific IgE levels than negative ones (median 13 vs 7 AU/ml; P < 0.0001). The prospective part of the study was performed on 103 birch pollen-hypersensitive patients who were OAS-free at the time of the first visit and were periodically followed-up for OAS. Patients who developed Apiaceae sensitivity showed much higher birch-specific IgE levels than patients who developed apple/hazelnut allergy only (median 15.5 vs 8.5 AU/ml; P < 0.05), whereas those who remained OAS-free showed the lowest specific IgE levels (median 5 AU/ml). This study suggests that most Apiaceae determinants cross-react with apple or hazelnut determinants, whereas only some apple or hazelnut determinants cross-react with Apiaceae-allergenic determinants; moreover, it shows that birch-specific IgE levels heavily influence the onset of OAS as a whole, and probably play a critical role in the development of allergies to distinct vegetable foods as well."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ambulatorio di Allergologia, Ospedale Caduti Bollatesi, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Asero", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Allergy", "NlmUniqueID": "7804028", "ISSNLinking": "0105-4538"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "37341-29-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin E"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Cross Reactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Daucus carota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Follow-Up Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Hypersensitivity"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin E"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Nuts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9201368", "10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb02600.x"]}}]}
