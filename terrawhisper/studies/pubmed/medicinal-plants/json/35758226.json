The impact of sewage sludge on the mass ratios between microelements contained in the plant biomass was analyzed as well. The long-term field experiment consisted in application of four levels of fertilization with sewage sludge: 10, 20, 40, and 60\u2009Mg DM\u00b7ha<sup>-1</sup>. A non-fertilized control object (0\u2009Mg DM\u00b7ha<sup>-1</sup>) was used as well. The miscanthus biomass was characterized by higher content of Al and Mn, whereas higher levels of Fe, Co, and Mo were determined in the reed canary grass biomass. As in the case of the element content, the giant miscanthus was characterized by highest level of Al and Mn uptake, while the highest uptake of Fe, Co, and Mo was exhibited by the reed canary grass. In the group of the analyzed microelements, the giant miscanthus showed the highest the recovery of Mo (47%) followed by Mn (39%), Fe (35%), and Co (15%), and the lowest uptake was determined in the case of Al (5%)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5562-4943"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Industrial and Medicinal Plants, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Ko\u0142odziej", "ForeName": "Barbara", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-8753-2119"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Chemistry, University of Agriculture in Krakow, Krakow, Poland."}], "LastName": "Antonkiewicz", "ForeName": "Jacek", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0268-0148"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Soil Science Environment Engineering and Management, University of Life Sciences in Lublin, Lublin, Poland."}], "LastName": "Bieli\u0144ska", "ForeName": "El\u017cbieta Jolanta", "Initials": "EJ"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4306-0030"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agroecology and Crop Production, University of Agriculture in Krakow, Krakow, Poland."}], "LastName": "Witkowicz", "ForeName": "Robert", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2586-5559"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agrotechnology and Agribusiness, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Olsztyn, Poland."}], "LastName": "Dubis", "ForeName": "Bogdan", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Phytoremediation", "NlmUniqueID": "101136878", "ISSNLinking": "1522-6514"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sewage"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sewage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phalaris"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biodegradation, Environmental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomass"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "6", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35758226", "10.1080/15226514.2022.2090495"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
