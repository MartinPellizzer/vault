The structures of these alkaloids were established by comprehensive analyses of the 1D, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS data. Configurations of sugar moieties were resolved by chemical derivations. The isolated compounds showed nitric oxide (NO) inhibitory activities in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced RAW264.7\u00a0cells, and yibeinone exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects among them. This study revealed that the alkaloids from F. pallidiflora might have significant anti-inflammatory potentials."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
