Objective In this study, the little known species Sideroxylon obtusifolium T.D. Penn (Sapotacea) and Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels (Myrtaceae), from the Caatinga biome in Brazil were chemically characterized and explored for their antifungal potential against C. albicans. Materials and methods We determined the effects of hydroalcoholic extracts/fractions upon fungal growth (minimum inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations, MIC/MFC), biofilm morphology (scanning electron microscopy) and viability (confocal laser scanning microscopy), proposed their mode of action (sorbitol and ergosterol assays), and finally investigated their effects against macrophage and keratinocyte cells in a cell-based assay. Data were analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post-test (\u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05). Results The n-butanol (Nb) fraction from S. obtusifolium and S. cumini extract (Sc) showed flavonoids (39.11\u2009\u00b1\u20096.62\u2009mg/g) and saponins (820.35\u2009\u00b1\u2009225.38\u2009mg/g), respectively, in their chemical composition and demonstrated antifungal activity, with MICs of 62.5 and 125\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Nb and Sc may complex with ergosterol as there was a 4-16-fold increase in MICs in the presence of exogenous ergosterol, leading to disrupted permeability of cell membrane. Deleterious effects were observed on morphology and viability of treated biofilms from concentrations as low as their MICs and higher. Sc was not toxic to macrophages and keratinocytes at these concentrations (p\u2009>\u00a00.05), unlike Nb. Conclusions Nb and Sc demonstrated considerable antifungal activity and should be further investigated as potential alternative candidates to treat Candida biofilms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Dentistry , State University of Paraiba , Campina Grande , PB , Brazil ;"}], "LastName": "Pereira", "ForeName": "Jozinete Vieira", "Initials": "JV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology, Anesthesiology and Therapeutics, Department of Physiological Sciences , Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas , Piracicaba , SP , Brazil ;"}], "LastName": "Freires", "ForeName": "Irlan Almeida", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology, Anesthesiology and Therapeutics, Department of Physiological Sciences , Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas , Piracicaba , SP , Brazil ;"}], "LastName": "Castilho", "ForeName": "Aline Rog\u00e9ria", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology, Anesthesiology and Therapeutics, Department of Physiological Sciences , Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas , Piracicaba , SP , Brazil ;"}], "LastName": "da Cunha", "ForeName": "Marcos Guilherme", "Initials": "MG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Department of Pharmacy , State University of Paraiba , Campina Grande , PB , Brazil."}], "LastName": "Alves", "ForeName": "Harley da Silva", "Initials": "Hda S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Pharmacology, Anesthesiology and Therapeutics, Department of Physiological Sciences , Piracicaba Dental School, University of Campinas , Piracicaba , SP , Brazil ;"}], "LastName": "Rosalen", "ForeName": "Pedro Luiz", "Initials": "PL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pharm Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "9812552", "ISSNLinking": "1388-0209"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Biofilms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Viability"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Atomic Force"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Confocal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sapotaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Syzygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "3", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26987037", "10.3109/13880209.2016.1155629"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
