Twenty-five furocoumarin derivatives were thus designed and synthesized in order to improve the melanogenesis in B16 cells for the first time. Among them, twenty-three compounds were more potent than the positive control (8-MOP), the commonly used drug for vitiligo in clinic. Noticeably, compounds 6m (350.5%) and 6p (313.1%) based on the scaffold of 6k (2H-benzofuro[2,3-h]chromen-2-one) were nearly 3-fold stronger than 8-MOP (114.50%). The in vitro melanin synthesis evaluation of these structurally diverse analogues had also led to an outline of structure-activity relationship."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
