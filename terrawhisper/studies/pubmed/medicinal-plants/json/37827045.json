Utilizing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) proves to be an effective strategy for alleviating heavy metal toxicity in plants. To this end, AMF were applied to mitigate TI toxic effects on the growth, primary and secondary metabolism of soybean plants. Here, TI stress inhibited the growth and photosynthetic parameters of soybean plants. It also increased the oxidative damage as demonstrated by increased levels of oxidative markers, (MDA and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity). However, AMF could mitigate the reduction in growth and photosynthesis induced by TI, as well as the induction of oxidative damage. To overcome TI toxicity, AMF increased the levels and metabolism of osmolytes such as proline in soybean plants. This was in line with the increased activities of key enzymes that involved in proline biosynthesis (e.g., P5CS (pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase), P5CR (pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase) and OAT (ornithine aminotransferase) under the AMF and/or TI treatments. Furthermore, soybean plants could benefit from the synergism between AMF and TI to enhance the contents of individual (e.g., spermine and spermidine) and total polyamines as well as their metabolic enzymes (e.g., arginine decarboxylase and ornithine decarboxylase). Overall, the combined application of AMF emerges as a viable approach for alleviating TI toxicity in soybean plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.
