C. minima is well-known in the list of medicinal plants with capacities in treatment of whooping cough, nasal allergy, malaria, and asthma. More than sixty reports on phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of this plant are now available, but a supportive review is insufficient.", "The current review aims to make a compilation of almost all of the isolated compounds from the title plant, together with their pharmacological activities.", "Centipeda minima is a meaningful keyword to search for previous references, while the reliable databases, such as Sci-Finder, Google Scholar, Pub Med, Science Direct, the Web of Science, Scopus, Bentham science, Taylor Francis, Springer, IOP Science were utilized at most.", "More than one hundred secondary metabolites, classifying as terpenoids, flavonoids, mono-phenols, fatty acids, amides, and other types, were isolated from this plant. Among them, sesquiterpene lactones are dominant in either C. minima species or numerous plants of genus Centipeda. These phytochemical groups also possessed various biological results like anti-cancer, anti-bacteria, anti-allergy, anti-virus, anti-inflammation, and hepatoprotective activities. With many kinds of bioactive results such as anti-cancer and anti-inflammation, the use of C. minima plant extracts and isolated compounds for drug development seems to be a futuristic strategy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Linh", "ForeName": "Nguyen Thi Thuy", "Initials": "NTT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Ha", "ForeName": "Nguyen Thi Thu", "Initials": "NTT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Tra", "ForeName": "Nguyen Thanh", "Initials": "NT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Anh", "ForeName": "Le Thi Tu", "Initials": "LTT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Tuyen", "ForeName": "Nguyen Van", "Initials": "NV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Biotech, Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Caugiay, Hanoi, Vietnam."}], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Ninh The", "Initials": "NT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mini Rev Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101094212", "ISSNLinking": "1389-5575"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "8", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "25"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33087028", "10.2174/1389557520666201021143257", "MRMC-EPUB-110809"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
