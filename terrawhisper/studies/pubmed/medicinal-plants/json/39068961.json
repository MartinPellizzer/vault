This ability can be utilized to manipulate plant phytochemistry in a desired direction. However, the abundance of secondary metabolites in the different plant species, especially medicinal, is enormous; therefore, it is difficult to establish a clear direction for the effects of metabolic modulators on phytochemical composition, especially given the possibility of using different types thereof. In order to gain insight into these changes, we investigated the effects of foliar-applied chitosan (ChL, 100\u00a0mg/L), selenium (Se, 10\u00a0mg/L), salicylic acid (SA, 150\u00a0mg/L), or an equal volume mixture thereof on Hypericum perforatum L. metabolism. Selenium and SA proved to be the more effective than ChL in enhancing the accumulation of phenolic compounds. The greatest increase was found in the concentration of neochlorogenic acid after Se-spraying. The treatment with the elicitors generally increased the concentration of identified flavonoids, but not the level of naphthodianthrone or phloroglucinol metabolites. The most pronounced response was observed on day 10 following the application of the compounds, and is likely the consequence of elevated levels of O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>\u02d9, free proline, and modulated activity of enzymatic antioxidants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
