The development and yield of the plants was determined in two experiments--one immediately post-monsoon and one in the following spring (pre-monsoon). Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and photochemical oxidants were measured at each site. The effect on yield of EDU at the suburban site (47 and 113% increase in seed weight per plant relative to the untreated plants in the post- and pre-monsoon experiments, respectively) was similar to the effects of filtration on yield on soybean in a parallel open-top chamber study at the same site (77% increase relative to plants subjected to unfiltered air for the pre-monsoon experiment). Effects of EDU on yield were greater at both rural sites than at the suburban site in both experiments, and greater in the spring experiment (182% at the remote rural site and 285% at the rural roadside site) than in the post-monsoon experiment (94% at the remote rural site and 170% at the rural roadside site); oxidant concentrations were also greater at the rural sites than at the suburban site, and greater in the spring experiment than the post-monsoon experiment. The results imply that ozone may be causing significant crop losses in rural areas around Lahore; however, the geographical extent of the problem, and the implications for peri-urban agriculture around other cities of south Asia are uncertain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore-54590, Pakistan."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wahid", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Milne", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shamsi", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ashmore", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Marshall", "ForeName": "F M", "Initials": "FM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Environ Pollut", "NlmUniqueID": "8804476", "ISSNLinking": "0269-7491"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Air Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54924-46-8", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene diurea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66H7ZZK23N", "NameOfSubstance": "Ozone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agriculture"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Air Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidants, Photochemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ozone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylurea Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "29", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11428135", "10.1016/s0269-7491(00)00190-1", "S0269749100001901"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
