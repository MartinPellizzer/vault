The recommended treatment by the WHO is serotherapy, which has limited effectiveness against the toxins involved in local tissue damage. In some countries, patients use plants from folk medicines as antivenoms. Aegiphila species are common plants from the Brazilian Amazon and are used to treat snakebites. In this study, leaves from Aegiphila integrifolia (Jacq) Moldenke were collected from Roraima state, Brazil and its ethanolic extract was evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments to verify their antiophidic activity against Bothrops atrox crude venom. The isolated compounds from A. integrifolia were analyzed and the chemical structures were elucidated on the basis of infrared, ultraviolet, mass, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>1</sup>\u00b3C NMR spectrometry data. Among the described compounds, lupeol (7), betulinic acid (1), \u03b2-sitosterol (6), stigmasterol (5), mannitol (4), and the flavonoids, pectolinarigenin (2) and hispidulin (3), were identified. The ethanolic extract and flavonoids (2 and 3) partially inhibited the proteolytic, phospholipase A2 and hyaluronidase activities of B. atrox venom, and the skin hemorrhage induced by this venom in mice. Antimicrobial activity against different bacteria was evaluated and the extract partially inhibited bacterial growth. Thus, taken together, A. integrifolia ethanolic extract has promising use as an antiophidic and antimicrobial."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
