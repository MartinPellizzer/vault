The present study describes the determination of total polyphenolic compounds, total flavonoids and GC-MS analysis of hexane and chloroform fractions of 70% ethanol extract of whole almond shelled seed. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of various extracts of the nuts were evaluated. Folin-Ciocalteau procedure resulted in total polyphenolic compounds as 0.008 mg (gallic acid equivalents)/mg of the dried extract and amount of total flavonoids contents yielded were 0.001 mg (quercetin equivalents)/mg of the nuts dried extracts. GC-MS analysis of the hexane and chloroform fractions yielded a number of volatile constituents, resulting in highest amounts of 6-Octadecenoic acid and 1,1,3,3-Tetramethyl cyclopentane as 37.52% and 24.54% in hexane and chloroform fractions respectively. Antioxidant activity using the DPPH radical scavenging assay resulted in very low activity in all the extracts. Only n-butanol extract showed mild activity against the gram negative E. coli with inhibition zone diameter 8 mm while rest of samples did not show any activity against any microbial strains under study."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Swabi, Swabi, Pakistan/Department of Chemistry, Abdul Wali Khan University, Mardan, Pakistan/Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, PR China."}], "LastName": "Qureshi", "ForeName": "Muhammad Nasimullah", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry in Arid Regions, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, PR China/Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Urumqi, P.
