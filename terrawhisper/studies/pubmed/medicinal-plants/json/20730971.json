Willd., Alpinia calcarata Rosc., Alpinia speciosa K. Schum., and Alpinia allughas Rosc. were examined and compared by capillary GC and GC/MS. Monoterpenoids were the major oil constituents identified. 1,8-Cineole, alpha-terpineol, (E)-methyl cinnamate, camphor, terpinen-4-ol, and alpha- and beta-pinenes were the major constituents commonly distributed in leaf and flower essential oils. The presence of endo-fenchyl acetate, exo-fenchyl acetate, and endo-fenchol was the unique feature of rhizome essential oils of A. galanga, A. calcarata, and A. speciosa. On contrary, the rhizome oil of A. allughas was dominated by beta-pinene. Significant qualitative and quantitative variations were observed in essential-oil compositions of different parts of Alpinia species growing in subtemperate and subtropical regions of Northern India. Cluster analysis was performed to find similarities and differences in essential-oil compositions based on representative molecular skeletons. Monoterpenoids, viz., 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, camphor, pinenes, (E)-methyl cinnamate, and fenchyl derivatives, were used as chemotaxonomic markers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP, CSIR), Research Center, Pantnagar-263149, Uttarakhand, India. padaliarc@rediffmail.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Padalia", "ForeName": "Rajendra C", "Initials": "RC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Verma", "ForeName": "Ram S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sundaresan", "ForeName": "Velusamy", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chanotiya", "ForeName": "Chandan S", "Initials": "CS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "Chem Biodivers", "NlmUniqueID": "101197449", "ISSNLinking": "1612-1872"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "classification"], "DescriptorName": "Alpinia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Structures"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "12", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["20730971", "10.1002/cbdv.201000013"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
