KSL at the same doses decreased the contents of PGE2 in inflammatory swelling toes, and the decreased A values were 25.6,16.1, 10.0 (A x 10(3)), respectively. After administration of KSL in vivo at 540 and 270 mg x kg(-1) the T lymphocyte proliferation were attenuated by 32.1% and 31.0%, and the production of IL-2 was inhibited by 17.5% and 14.0% respectively. While the inhibitory rates of T lymphocyte proliferation were reduced by 39.0% and 22.1% and the production of IL-2 was diminished by 27.3% and 18.2% respectively following the administration of KSL in vitro.", "KSL possesses the anti-inflammation function."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Children Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 210000, China. huaidong5187@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Cong-Pin", "Initials": "CP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yu-Lin", "Initials": "YL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K7Q1JQR04M", "NameOfSubstance": "Dinoprostone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ants"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dinoprostone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16570809"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
