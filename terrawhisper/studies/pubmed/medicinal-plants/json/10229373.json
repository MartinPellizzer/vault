Ninety-five pregnant, spring-calving crossbred cows (541 +/- 51 kg) in 1995 to 1996 and 65 cows (602 +/- 60 kg) in 1996 to 1997 were randomly assigned to one of five treatments (19 and 13 cows per treatment in 1995 to 1996 and 1996 to 1997, respectively): 1) unprocessed Great Northern beans to supply 182 g/d of CP (GNB); 2) canola meal to supply 182 g/d of CP (CM); 3) a mixture of Great Northern beans and sunflower meal, each to supply 91 g/d of CP, for a total of 182 g/d of CP (MIX); 4) sunflower meal to supply 182 g/d of CP (SFM+); and 5) sunflower meal to supply 91 g/d of CP (SFM-). Cow weight and body condition performance were broken into a gestation and a lactation phase in 1995 to 1996; calves were weighed at birth, at the end of the lactation phase in April, and at weaning the following September. Only gestation performance was monitored in 1996 to 1997, and subsequent calf birth and weaning weight were recorded. The SFM- group lost more weight during the gestation phase than other treatments (P < .05), yet no differences were detected for gestation phase daily BCS change, calf birth weight, lactation phase daily weight change, lactation phase daily BCS change, first-service conception rate to AI, or overall pregnancy rate. Off-test calf weight was higher in April for calves from dams of the SFM+ and CM treatments than for calves from dams on the GNB or SFM- treatments (P < .05), and calves from cows on the CM treatment were heavier in April than calves from cows on the MIX treatment (P < .05). No differences in calf weight were present at weaning. Consumption of beans by cows on the GNB treatment was low because of palatability problems. Mixing the beans with sunflower meal in the MIX treatment eliminated this problem. Canola meal, Great Northern beans, or a combination of sunflower meal and Great Northern beans were comparable to sunflower meal as protein supplements for beef cows grazing native winter range, despite obvious palatability problems with the beans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA."}], "LastName": "Patterson", "ForeName": "H H", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Whittier", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rittenhouse", "ForeName": "L R", "Initials": "LR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schutz", "ForeName": "D N", "Initials": "DN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Anim Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "8003002", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8812"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colorado"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Helianthus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "6", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10229373", "10.2527/1999.773750x"]}}]}
