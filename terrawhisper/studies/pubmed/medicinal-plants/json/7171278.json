The two processes decreased the available lysine of cowpea from 6.3 to 5.7%. The starch content decreased from 50.7% in raw cowpea to 44.9% and 42.1% in cooked extruded cowpea, respectively. Cooking eliminated the trypsin inhibitor content of cowpea. Damaged starch increased from 0.3% in the raw cowpea, to 22.5% in cooked cowpea and to 30.5% in extruded cowpea. In the first experiment it was determined that the protein efficiency ratio (PER) in rats was not affected by cowpea processing (means = 1.17) and that DL-methionine supplementation increased (P less than 0.01) PER to 2.08. In the second experiment, it was established that energy digestibility of the diets used in the first experiment averaged 88.0% with no differences due to processing or supplementation. Digestible energy content (DE) was lower (P less than 0.01) in diets supplemented with DL-methionine (3.58, 3.56, 3.93) than in those without supplement (3.67, 3.93, 3.75). On the other hand, diets with extruded cowpea produced higher (P less than 0.01) DE (3.84 kcal/g) than diets with cooked cowpea (3.75 kcal/g). Classical (EM) and nitrogen corrected (EMn) metabolizable energy determined in chicks showed that both were higher (P less than 0.01) in cooked (3.01; 2.56 kcal/g) and extruded (3.16; 2.76 kcal/g) than in raw cowpeas (1.86; 1.81 kcal/g)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cabezas", "ForeName": "M T", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Murillo", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El\u00edas", "ForeName": "L G", "Initials": "LG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Valor nutritivo del frijol caup\u00ed crudo y procesado."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Venezuela", "MedlineTA": "Arch Latinoam Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0067507", "ISSNLinking": "0004-0622"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AE28F7PNPL", "NameOfSubstance": "Methionine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Handling"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Methionine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7171278"]}}]}
