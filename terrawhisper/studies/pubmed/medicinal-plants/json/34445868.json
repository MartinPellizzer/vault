In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of luteolin in alleviating sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. GeneCards and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform were employed to screen luteolin, sevoflurane, and neurotoxicity-related genes. Subsequently, we isolated primary neurons from the hippocampus of 1-day-old C57BL/6J mice and tested for cytotoxicity after treatment of different concentrations of luteolin. Next, we measured the expression of apoptosis by flow cytometry and assessed inflammation-related factors, including heme oxygenase-1 expression detected by immunohistochemical staining and neuronal apoptosis. Finally, water maze, open field, and fear conditioning tests were conducted to observe the interaction between luteolin and sevoflurane in cognitive impairment of mice. Luteolin had the lowest cytotoxicity at concentrations of 30 or 60 \u03bcg/mL; we selected 30 \u03bcg/mL for drug administration experiments <i>in vitro</i>. Luteolin inhibited sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory responses through the autophagic pathway and thus ameliorated sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice. Mechanistically, luteolin up-regulated heme oxygenase-1 expression, which activated the autophagy pathway <i>in vitro</i>. This was confirmed by subsequent histological experiments in mice and behavioral results showing rescue cognitive impairment. Our findings uncovered an inhibitory role of luteolin in sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory response through activation of autophagy arising from up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1, thereby alleviating sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anesthesiology, Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, No. 555, Youyi East Road, Nanshaomen, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710054, P.
