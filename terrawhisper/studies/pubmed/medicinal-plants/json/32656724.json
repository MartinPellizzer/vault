Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty is an important aromatic plant used in perfumery industries, soil, water conservation, and agricultural practices. In this study, the transcriptomic sequence of vetiver leaf and root was subjected to miRNA identification by the computational methods. miRNA identification was carried out using a homology-based method by C-mii software with several other online tools. A total of 80 miRNA were identified from both leaf and root sequences. Target identification was done by identified miRNA sets. A total of 25 and 31 miRNA families were identified in both leaf and root, respectively, with ten common families involve in different ontological function. miR169 and miR5021 regulate most of the target in leaf and root. In vetiver, many primary and secondary metabolism elements are regulated by miRNA as photo-system, transcription factor, terpenoid metabolism, etc. Here is the first in silico study revealing the specific miRNAs and their target genes for corresponding root and leaf tissues respectively in C. zizanioides."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4208-2481"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetics and Plant Breeding Division, CSIR-Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, UP, 226015, India. mishra.anand653@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "Anand", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bioinformatics Department, CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, UP, 226001, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Sanchita", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9285-2486"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, U P, Lucknow, 226015, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIR-Human Resource Development Centre Campus, Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Sector 19, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, 201002, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Pankhuri", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Division, CSIR-Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, U P, Lucknow, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Dhawan", "ForeName": "Sunita Singh", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetics and Plant Breeding Division, CSIR-Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, UP, 226015, India."}], "LastName": "Lal", "ForeName": "Raj Kishori", "Initials": "RK"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "21 (1020)/16/EMR-II", "Agency": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Appl Biochem Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8208561", "ISSNLinking": "0273-2289"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "MicroRNAs"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysopogon"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computer Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Profiling"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MicroRNAs"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "6", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "5", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32656724", "10.1007/s12010-020-03381-z", "10.1007/s12010-020-03381-z"]}}]}
