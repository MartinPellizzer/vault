In this work, a multifunctional PS (named DSABBT NPs) with AIE activity has been designed and prepared to carry out ultrafast staining, excellent two-photon bioimaging, and high-efficiency image-guided PDT. Simply, DSABBT with AIE characteristic was synthesized by one-step Schiff reaction of 4-(diethylamino)-salicylaldehyde (DSA) and 4,7-bis(4-aminophenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BBT). Then, DSABBT and DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub>-cRGD generate nanoparticles (NPs) easily in an ultrapure water/tetrahydrofuran mixture through a facile nanoprecipitation at room temperature. We found that DSABBT NPs exhibit bright solid-state fluorescence with large stokes shifts (180 nm) and two-photon absorption cross-section (1700 GM). Importantly, DSABBT NPs exhibited excellent ability of ultrafast staining and two-photon imaging, which can readily label suborganelles by subtly shaking the living cells for 5 s under mild conditions. Moreover, DSABBT NPs displayed high singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) generation capacity and remarkable image-guided PDT efficiency. Therefore, DSABBT NPs can act as the promising candidate for multifunctional PSs, which can destroy cancer cells and block malignant tumor growth via the production of reactive oxygen species upon irradiation conditions. These outcomes provide us with a selectable strategy for developing multifunctional theranostic systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation":
