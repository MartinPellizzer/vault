Phosphorus, one of the necessary macroelements for plant growth and development, plays an important role in cell structure, material composition and energy metabolism, and signal transduction in plants. Phosphate transporter(PHT) genes are important for plant growth and development, root morphogenesis, secondary metabolism, hormone response, and phosphorus balance. Most of the active components in medicinal plants are secondary metabolites. Thus, it is essential to reveal the relationship between the regulation of phosphorus and the accumulation of active components in medicinal plants, especially the effect of phosphorus starvation on root morphogenesis of root medicinal materials and its coupling with hormone response. With advancement of molecular biology, scholars gradually emphasize the mechanism of PHT regulating the secondary metabolism of medicinal plants. This study summarized the strategies of plants to adapt to low phosphorus environment, such as changing root morphogenesis, inhibiting taproot growth, forming cluster root and changing physiological metabolism, PHT, its regulatory network, phenotypic biological characteristics and key genes in medicinal plants related to phosphorus starvation, and the response mechanism. The findings are expected to lay a basis for the cultivation of medicinal plants with high quality, excellent shape, and high price."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Cultivation and Propagation Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hai", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Cultivation and Propagation Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Changchun 130112, China College of Pharmacy and Bioengineering, Chengdu University Chengdu 610106, China Jilin Provincial Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Cultivation and Propagation Changchun 130112, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya-Yu", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "27YLU75U4W", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphorus"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hormones"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphorus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hormones"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Morphogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "6", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "23"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36604905", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20220810.104"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
