Therefore, this study compares the effects of flaxseed powder and magnesium hydroxide on bowel movements of acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in ICU.", "The population of the present parallel randomized controlled clinical trial included 70 acute myocardial infarction patients hospitalized in ICU who had no history of chronic constipation. The patients in the intervention group were given three sachets of flaxseed powder (each sachet was 3 g) twice a day for four days. The patients in the control group were given 20 cc of magnesium hydroxide syrup each morning. The Bristol scale was used to describe stool consistency.", "The mean and standard deviation of the number of bowel movements within five days after intervention are 1.86 \u00b1 1.08 and 1.6 \u00b1 0.65 in the intervention and the control groups, respectively. The frequency of normal stool consistency of the first bowel movement is 94.3% for the intervention group and 85.7% for the control group, which shows no significant differences between the two groups in terms of stool consistency and bowel movement frequency (P=0.510). The bowel movements started on average after 35.2\u00b197.97 hours in the flaxseed group and 24.771\u00b12.677 hours in the magnesium hydroxide group (P=0.023).", "The results showed that flaxseed powder increases bowel movement frequency and improves the patients' stool consistency, but the differences between the two groups are insignificant.
