The higher the altitude, the less the number of flowerlets each inflorescence; and the higher the longitude is, the more the number of flowerlets each inflorescence. The temperature and the humidity of the circumstance affects the number of flowerlets each inflorescence. Lower temperature, higher diurnal variation of temperature, and higher diurnal variation of relative humidity causes less number of flowerlets each inflorescence. There is significantly negative correlation between the number of flowerlets each inflorescence and the maturing rate of infructescence. The difference of the maturing rate of infructescence from five populations don't approach significant level. The difference of the maturing rate of infructescence approaches significant level by multiple comparisons between Magnan population and Baoshan population, Gongshan population and Xichou population. There is not significant correlation between the maturing rate of infructescence and the altitude, the longitude and the latitude.", "The factors of the circumstance affects the number of flowerlets each inflorescence. The climate by the change of the altitude affects the number of flowerlets each inflorescence highly significantly.

Maybe the difference of the maturing rate of inflorescence is mainly caused by different genetic resources.
