Herein, we constructed an integrative approach to efficiently discover covalent inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup> from complex herbal matrices. This work begins with biological screening of 60 clinically used antiviral herbal medicines, among which Lonicera japonica Flos (LJF) demonstrated the strongest anti-M<sup>pro</sup> effect (IC<sub>50</sub> \u2009=\u200937.82\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Mass spectrometry (MS)-based chemical analysis and chemoproteomic profiling revealed that LJF extract contains at least 50 constituents, of which 22 exhibited the capability to covalently modify M<sup>pro</sup> . We subsequently verified the anti-M<sup>pro</sup> effects of these covalent binders. Gallic acid and quercetin were found to potently inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 M<sup>pro</sup> in dose- and time- dependent manners, with the IC<sub>50</sub> values below 10\u2009\u00b5M. The inactivation kinetics, binding affinity and binding mode of gallic acid and quercetin were further characterized by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, surface plasmon resonance, and covalent docking simulations. Overall, this study established a practical approach for efficiently discovering the covalent inhibitors of M<sup>pro</sup> from herbal medicines by integrating target-based high-throughput screening and MS-based assays, which would greatly facilitate the discovery of key antiviral constituents from medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."}, "AuthorList":
