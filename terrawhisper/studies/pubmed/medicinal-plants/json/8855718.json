The crude drug of 0.20 g with 1.0 ml of water in a capped vial was heated at 130 degrees C for 45 min. Then 0.5 ml of vaporized components were collected by gas tightsillinge, and were applied into the injection port of GC or GC/MS. Consequently we could analyze and confirm the following components; hinesol and beta-eudesmol were found to be contained in Atractylodis Lanceae Rhizoma and atractylon in Atractylodis Rhizoma. beta-Eudesmol was analyzed by headspace gas chromatography, and the obtained calibration curve showed good linearity over the range from 2.5 micrograms to 10.0 mg. The result agreed with those obtained using numerical analyses by the steam distillation method. Atractylodis was found to have a wide variety of components depending on the available sources and on the stored conditions. This method was, therefore, more rapid and simpler determination of essential oils in crude drugs using headspace gas chromatography than those used previously. The method was useful means of the analyses of components in crude drugs such as Atractylodis plants and quality control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, Kinki University, Osaka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yasuda", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Oka", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Otsuki", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsuchihashi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Katagi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishikawa", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8855718", "10.1248/yakushi1947.116.9_728"]}}]}
