The dysregulated lipid homeostasis due to various genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors is considered one of the critical putative pathways mediating obesity. Nonetheless, the scientific advancements unleashing the molecular dynamics of lipid metabolism have provided deeper insights on the emerging roles of lipid hydrolysing enzymes, including pancreatic lipase. It is hypothesized that inhibiting pancreatic lipase would prevent the breakdown of triglyceride and delays the absorption of fatty acids into the systemic circulation and adipocytes. Whilst, orlistat is the only conventional pancreatic lipase enzyme inhibitor available in clinics, identifying the safe clinical alternatives from plants to inhibit pancreatic lipase has been considered a significant advancement. Consequently, plants which have shown significant potential to combat obesity are now revisited for its abilities to inhibit pancreatic lipase. In this regard, our review surveyed the potential of medicinal plants and its phytoconstituents to inhibit pancreatic lipase and to elicit anti-obesity effects. Thus, the review collate and critically appraise the potential of medicinal plants and phyto-molecules inhibiting pancreatic lipase enzyme and consequently modulating triglyceride absorption in gut, and discuss its implications in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat obesity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
