This study was designed to examine antidiabetic effects of <i>Allium jesdianum</i> (<i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i>) ethanolic extract and evaluate its effects on oxidative stress markers and the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) genes in the kidney of type 1 diabetic rats.", "In this study, we randomly divided 24 rats into four groups with six rats in each group as follows: Cnt group: normal control receiving normal saline, Dibt group: diabetic control receiving normal saline daily, Dibt\u00a0+\u00a0<i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i> 250 group: diabetic rats receiving <i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i> at a dose of 250\u00a0mg/kg bw daily, Dibt\u00a0+\u00a0<i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i> 500 group: diabetic rats receiving <i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i> at a dose of 500\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw daily. To induce diabetes, we used 55\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw dose of streptozotocin intraperitoneally. The concentration of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum urea, creatinine and albumin, SOD, MDA (using spectrophotometric methods) and gene expression of CTGF and RAGE in kidney tissue (using real-time PCR methods) were quantified in the diabetic rats that received <i>A.\u00a0jesdianum</i> for 42\u00a0days, and were compared to control rats.", "The results showed that in the diabetic group the FBG and serum urea, creatinine and expression of kidney CTGF and RAGE genes and the levels of SOD and MDA significantly increased and serum albumin significantly decreased compared to the Cnt group (p<0.001).
