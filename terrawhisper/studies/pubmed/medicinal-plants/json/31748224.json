Our rapid screening study found PPR caused time-dependent inhibition of cytochrome P450s (CYP) 3A and 2D6, and CYP3A was inactivated the most. Further study demonstrated that PPR is a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A, and significant loss (49.5% \u00b1 3.9%) of CYP3A activity was observed after 20minute incubations with 80 <i>\u03bc</i>M PPR at 37\u00b0C. The values of <i>K</i> <sub>I</sub> and <i>k</i> <sub>inact</sub> were 30.7 <i>\u03bc</i>M and 0.041 minutes<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. CYP3A competitive inhibitor ketoconazole showed protective effect against the enzyme inactivation. Superoxide dismutase/catalase and GSH displayed minor protection against the PPR-caused enzyme inactivation. Ferricyanide partially reduced the enzyme inhibition by PPR. Additionally, NADPH-dependent formation of reactive metabolites from PPR were found in human liver microsomal incubation mixtures. An <i>ortho</i>-quinone intermediate was trapped by NAC in microsomal incubations with PPR. DM-PPR, demethylene metabolite of PPR, showed weak enzyme inactivation relative to that caused by PPR. It appears that both carbene and <i>ortho</i>-quinone intermediates were involved in the inactivation of CYP3A caused by PPR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: CYP3A subfamily members (mainly CYP3A4 and CYP3A5) play a critical role in drug metabolism. Piperine (PPR), a methylenedioxyphenyl derivative combined with an unsaturated ketone, is the major active ingredient of pepper. PPR revealed time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent inhibitory effect on CYP3A. Carbene and quinone metabolites were both involved in the observed CYP3A inactivation by PPR. Apparently, the unsaturated ketone moiety did not participate in the enzyme inactivation. The present study sounds an alert of potential risk for food-drug interactions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics of Guizhou Province, and Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Monitoring and Disease Control, Ministry of Education, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, P.
