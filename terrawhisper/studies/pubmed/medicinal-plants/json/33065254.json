In recent years, research is increasingly being focused on exploitation of the active components from medicinal plants to combat the liver oxidative injury. In our study, we aimed to screen the active principles from A. vasica and clarify whether they could relieve oxidative damage induced by tert-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) and its potential mechanism via activating AMPK/p62/Nrf2 pathway.", "Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) was adopted for analysis of chemical composition in the extracts. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the fractions was evaluated using DPPH, ABTS and reducing power assay. Along with this, the compounds in this fraction with highest antioxidant activity were analyzed using UPLC-MS. Based on this, the condition for extracting flavonoids of this subfraction was optimized via response surface method. CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell viability. Detection kits were used to measure the activity changes of AST, ALT, LDH and CAT as well as MDA and GSH levels induced by t-BHP. Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was used DCFH-DA probe. DAPI staining and flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis. In terms of the mechanistic studies, the expression of proteins involved in AMPK/p62/Nrf2 pathway was measured using western blotting.", "Eventually, 70% ethanol extract from leaf of A. vasica was chosen due to its highest active components compared with other extracts. Further, ethyl acetate fraction derived from 70% ethanol extract in A. vasica (AVEA) possess highest ability for scavenging DPPH and ABTS free radicals as well as strongest reducing power than other fractions. Chemical composition analysis showed that AVEA contained 17 compounds, including 1 quinazoline alkaloid, 12 flavonoid-C-glycosides and 4 flavonoid-O-glycosides. In addition, the conditions (ratio of solid-liquid 1:14, the concentration of ethanol 73%, and the temperature 65\u00a0\u00b0C) were selected to enrich the flavonoids in AVEA. Furthermore, AVEA could attenuate t-BHP induced hepatocyte damage via increasing the cell viability, restoring abnormal the activities of AST, ALT, LDH and CAT as well as the levels of MDA and GSH. ROS fluorescence intensity was reduced by AVEA. Meanwhile, it could inhibit the cell apoptosis of BRL 3\u00a0A cells, as evidenced by restoration of cell morphology and decreasing the number of apoptotic cells. Further mechanistic studies indicated AVEA could promote p-AMPK expression to further induce autophagy adaptor-p62 protein expression, which could autophagic degradation of Keap1, leading to Nrf2 release and translocation into nucleus to induce antioxidant genes (HO-1, NQO-1, GCLC and GCLM) expression.", "In our study, AVEA was first to screen as the active fraction in A. vasica with alkaloids and abundant flavones. Moreover, the fraction potentiates its beneficial aspect by displaying the protective role on relieving t-BHP induced oxidative stress and activating AMPK/p62/Nrf2 pathway. AVEA helps maintain the redox homeostasis of hepatic cells and could be considered as an effective candidate against oxidative stress related liver disorders."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
