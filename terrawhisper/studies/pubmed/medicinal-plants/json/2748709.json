Qualitative analyses have been carried out with the TLC method whereas for quantitative analyses the GLC method has been applied. It has been found that the most frequently occurring are p,p'-DDT and its metabolites. The highest concentrations of these compounds have been observed in herbs from Lower Silesia and from the Bydgoszcz regions. Also in the region of Bia\u0142ystok concentrations of these compounds are generally higher than in other parts of Poland. Other pesticides have been found in a lesser number of herbal raw materials and in considerably lower concentrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Chair of Applied Pharmacy, Medical Academy, Wroc\u0142aw, Poland."}], "LastName": "Pluta", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CIW5S16655", "NameOfSubstance": "DDT"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Thin Layer"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "DDT"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Halogenated"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poland"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2748709"]}}]}
