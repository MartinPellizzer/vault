Rhizobia strains differed greatly in respect to tolerance of high temperature, adaptability of acidic environment and sensitivity to four antibiotics, but they had the same abilities of using different carbon and nitrogen sources. After 70 days from inoculated strains, the seedling formed nodules on the root (85.0%), and the dry matter of vine was increased by 51.1%.", "The rhizobia strains isolated from different ecological environments are good germplasm resources of tolerances to high temperature and acidic environment.
