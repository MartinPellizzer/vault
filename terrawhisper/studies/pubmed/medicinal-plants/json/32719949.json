In the current interest, we tried to confirm the relationship between the traditional medicinal plant, Calotropis procera (Aiton) W.T. Aiton, and its associated endophytes, Bacillus siamensis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, as the first matching study regarding the production of bioactive secondary metabolites from the plant vis-a-vis its bacterial endophytes.Secondary metabolites of both the plant and its endophytic bacteria were extracted using different solvents, e.g., water, methanol, and ethyl acetate. All extracts exhibited high quantities of phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, and saponins. In addition, they showed significant antioxidant capacity which was found to be positively correlated with total phenolic contents. The highest total antioxidant capacity (99.28\u2009\u00b1\u20090.0\u00a0mg AA equivalent/g extract) was measured for the aqueous extract of B. siamensis.Antibacterial activity of the different extracts was evaluated against certain pathogenic bacteria, i.e., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus. It was strikingly found that the broadest antibacterial spectrum was revealed by extracts of both C. procera and its endophytic B. siamensis. Interestingly, antibacterial activity was significantly correlated to phenolic and flavonoid contents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0737-7527"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Aswan University, Aswan, 81528, Egypt. nourasharkawi@sci.aswu.edu.eg."}], "LastName": "Hagaggi", "ForeName": "Noura Sh A", "Initials": "NSA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Aswan University, Aswan, 81528, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Mohamed", "ForeName": "Amal A A", "Initials": "AAA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arch Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0410427", "ISSNLinking": "0302-8933"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "SupplMeshList": ["Bacillus siamensis"], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus amyloliquefaciens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Calotropis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "17"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "16"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32719949", "10.1007/s00203-020-01989-7", "10.1007/s00203-020-01989-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
