The main limitations of conventional therapy are the adverse reaction on human health and the expensive cost of drugs. Indeed, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies that are less expensive and have fewer side effects. As a consequence of their natural compounds, medicinal plants can be used as an alternative therapy to cure various ailments including kidney diseases.", "of the study: This review paper has two principal goals: (1) to inventory and describe the plants and their ancestral use by Moroccan society to cure renal problems, (2) to link traditional use with scientific confirmations (preclinical and clinical).", "To analyze pharmacological effects, phytochemical, and clinical trials of plants, selected for renal therapy, a bibliographical search was undertaken by examining ethnobotanical investigations conducted in Morocco between 1991 and 2019 and consulting peer-reviewed papers from all over the world.", "Approximately 290 plant species, spanning 81 families and 218 genera have been reported as being utilized by Moroccans to manage renal illness. The most frequently mentioned species in Morocco were Herniaria hirsuta subsp. cinerea (DC.), Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) Fuss and Rosmarinus officinalis L. The leaves were the most frequently used plant parts, followed by the whole plant. Decoction and infusion were the most popular methods of preparation. A record of 71 plant species was studied in vitro and/or in vivo for their therapeutic efficacy against kidney disorders, including 10 plants attempting to make it to the clinical stage. Twenty compounds obtained from 15 plants have been studied for the treatment of kidney diseases.", "Medicinal herbs could be a credible alternative therapy for renal illness. However, additional controlled trials are required to confirm their efficiency in patients with kidney failure. Overall, this work could be used as a database for future exploration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
