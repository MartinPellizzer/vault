It is used as a traditional treatment for asthma, common cold, and dry pharynx. Numerous recent pharmacological studies on antiinfluenza, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties have confirmed the medicinal properties of the Chinese quince fruit (Chun et al., 2012). In March 2022, leaf spots on Chinese quince, resulting in defoliation, were observed in Andong, Gyeongsangbuk Province, Korea (Fig. 1A). The disease symptoms are dark brown spots on leaves. Later, the chlorophyll is lost, causing the entire leaf to become wilted and fell off (Fig. 1B). To identify the pathogen, symptomatic leaves were brought to the laboratory, cut into small pieces, and surface-disinfected in 70% ethanol for 15 s and rinsed with sterile distilled water (SDW). The specimens were then treated with 1% NaOCl for 15 s, followed by rinsing with SDW. Thus, surface-disinfected tissues were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7 d. A total of four isolates were obtained from the infected leaves. The colonies were transferred onto freshly prepared PDA plates by the single spore method for further purification. GYUN-10746 isolate was selected as the representative strain among the four isolates and deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC 410367). They initially produced white mycelia, which turned dark brown or pale brown at the center and beige at the periphery after 7 d (Fig. 1C and D). Conidiophores were pyriform, sometimes ovoid, or ellipsoidal and brown, measuring 30.8 \u00b1 0.49 \u00d7 12.9 \u00b1 0.26 \u00b5m (length \u00d7 width) (n=100) (Fig. 1E). The morphological characteristics were consistent with those of Alternaria alternata (Woudenberg et al. 2015). For molecular identification, DNA was amplified using the following primers: ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), EF1-728F/EF1-986R (Carbone et al. 1999), Gpd-R/Gpd-F (Berbee et al. 1999), Alt a1-F/Alt a1-R (Hong et al. 2005) and rpb2F/rpb2R (Liu et al. 1999) by PCR. DNA sequences from all 4 isolates (GYUN-10746, GYUN-11193, GYUN-11194 and GYUN-11195) were identical. The ITS (OP594615), TEF1-\u03b1 (OR327062), GAPDH (OR372157), Alt a 1 (OR327061), and RPB2 (OR352741) sequences from the representative isolate GYUN-10746 were 100% identical to those of previously identified A. alternate isolates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences of ITS, TEF1-\u03b1, GAPDH, Alt a l, and RPB2 to illustrate their relationship with A. alternata and related Alternaria species (Fig. 2). For the pathogenicity test, healthy Chinese quince branch containing leaves were inoculated with 7-day-old mycelial plugs of A. alternata, while leaves on a branch inoculated with PDA plugs alone served as a control group. Thus inoculated branches were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7 d. Disease symptoms were developed on leaves of the branches inoculated with mycelial plugs of the fungal pathogen (Fig. 1F), while no symptoms developed on control group. The resulting leaf spots resembled those on the original infected plants. To confirm Koch's postulates, the pathogen was re-isolated from inoculated leaves with identical morphological and molecular characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of leaf spot caused by A. alternata in C. sinensis in Korea. The identification of the pathogen may provide pertinent information for the development of disease controlling strategies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Andong National University, Department of Plant Medicals, Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); pinkpanda050@naver.com."}], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Yunjeong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Andong National University, Department of Plant Medicals, Andong, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); k.balaraju2@gmail.com."}], "LastName": "Kotnala", "ForeName": "Balaraju", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Korean Agricultural Culture, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, Korea (the Republic of); funguy@korea.kr."}], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Seung-Beom", "Initials": "SB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nakdonggang National Institute of Biological Resources, Microbial Research Department, Fungi Research Team, Sangju, Korea (the Republic of); applesident@naver.com."}], "LastName": "Cheon", "ForeName": "Wonsu", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hemp Natural products Research Center, Gyeongbuk Institute for Bioindustry, Andong, Korea (the Republic of); manhyo@gib.re.kr."}], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Manhyo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Andong National University, Department of Plant Medicals, Andong-si, Korea (the Republic of); yongbac@andong.ac.kr."}], "LastName": "Jeon", "ForeName": "Yongho", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "25", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38916907", "10.1094/PDIS-05-24-0984-PDN"]}}]}
