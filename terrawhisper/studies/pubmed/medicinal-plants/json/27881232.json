A total of 413 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the current study. Women were divided into 4 groups with equal age and body mass index according to glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels (\u22645.5; 5.5-6.0; 6.0-6.5; >6.5%). Serum Fe, Cu, and Zn levels were assessed using inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Blood HbA<sub>1c</sub>, serum glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and ceruloplasmin (Cp) were assessed using commercial kits. Homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and transferrin (Tf) saturation were calculated. The obtained data demonstrate that every 0.5% increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels from 5.5% is associated with a significant elevation of glucose, insulin, CRP, and HOMA-IR values. Diabetic patients were characterized by significantly higher Fe (11%), Cu (8%), and Zn (6%) levels as compared to the controls. At the same time, the overall trend to increased metal levels in association with HbA<sub>1c</sub> was detected only for Fe (p<0.05) and Cu (p<0.05). Serum ferritin levels in diabetic women was 3-fold higher than in the controls, whereas Tf saturation was decreased by 35%. Serum Cp levels were significantly increased by 19% in prediabetes, whereas in diabetic postmenopausal women no such increase was observed. A significant elevation of total metal concentration in diabetic subjects without a concomitant elevation of transport proteins may be indicative of increased levels of \"free\" Fe and Cu, known to be toxic."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier GmbH.
