A total of 480 one-day-old male Cobb broiler chicks were randomly allotted to 12 pens, with 40 birds per pen (replicate), and reared for 35 d. Dietary treatments consisted of a corn-soybean meal basal diet (control); a basal diet with 0.3% MHEM (T1); and a basal diet with 1% (T2) MHEM. At the end of the feeding trial, breast meat samples were excised and stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C to be analyzed at d 0, 3, and 7. The MHEM did not affect proximate composition of the breast meat. Total phenols content of the breast meats in the T1 and T2 diets was approximately 2 times greater than that of the control diet (P < 0.05). 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhy-drazyl radical-scavenging activity and 2,2-azinobis-(3 ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cation-reduction activity were greater in the T2 diet at d 0 and in the T1 diet at d 3 compared with the control diet (P < 0.05). 2-Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values in the T1 and T2 diets were lower than in the control diet at d 3 and 7 and did not increase during storage, whereas the value in the control diet increased significantly. The pH of the T1 diet was significantly greater than that of the control diet at d 0 and 3. In a sensory test, panelists preferred the T1 breast meat throughout the 7-d storage period. This research indicates that dietary MHEM could increase the antioxidative potential and overall preference of breast meat during cold storage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Quality Control and Utilization of Animal Products Division, National Institute of Animal Science, RDA, Suwon 441-706, Republic of Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jang", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "X-D", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "M-H", "Initials": "MH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "B-D", "Initials": "BD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "S-K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "J-H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jo", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenols"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Poultry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "10", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18931191", "10.3382/ps.2007-00506", "S0032-5791(19)39390-3"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
