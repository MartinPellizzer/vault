The excessive use of chemical pesticides has serious impacts on the environment and food safety. Therefore, development of effective management strategies in the form of bio-agents have important agricultural applications. Tenebrio molitor, a storage pest, causes losses of grains, medicinal materials, and various agricultural and related products in the warehouse. Bacillus subtilis YZ-1 isolated from naturally deceased Pieris rapae has been found to exhibit significant toxicity against T. molitor.", "Treatment with B. subtilis YZ-1 fermentation broth resulted in a 90-95% mortality rate of T. molitor within 36\u2009h post-treatment, indicating some active substances may have insecticidal activity in the bacterial supernatant. A bioactivity-guided fractionation method was used to isolate the insecticidal compounds from YZ-1, which led to the identification of surfactins. Additionally, a surfactin deletion mutant YZ-1\u25b3srfAA was constructed and the surfactin production by the mutant YZ-1\u25b3srfAA was verified through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Further, YZ-1\u25b3srfAA exhibited loss of insecticidal activity against T. molitor, Plutella xylostella and Achelura yunnanensis. The insecticidal activity and surfactins contents of several strains of Bacillus sp. were also tested and correlation was found between varying surfactins yield and insecticidal activity exhibited by different strains.", "Conclusively, our results suggest that B. subtilis YZ-1 may provide a novel approach for plant protection against agricultural pests. \u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Xia", "ForeName": "Mengyuan", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0026-6007"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Munir", "ForeName": "Shahzad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Ecology and Environmental Science, Yunnan University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yongmei", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Ayesha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Pengbo", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Yixin", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xingyu", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Tang", "ForeName": "Ping", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zaiqiang", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Pengfei", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Economic Plants and Biotechnology and Yunnan Key Laboratory for Wild Plant Resources, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuehu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory for Conservation and a Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China."}], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Yueqiu", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "32160672", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2022YFD1400700", "Agency": "National Key R&D Program of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "202202AE090025", "Agency": "Provincial Key R&D Program of Yunnan", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Pest Manag Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "100898744", "ISSNLinking": "1526-498X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lepidoptera"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Ongena M and Jacques P, Bacillus lipopeptides: versatile weapons for plant disease biocontrol.
