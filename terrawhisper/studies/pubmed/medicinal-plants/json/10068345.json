They were tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]tamsulosin binding to human prostatic alpha1-adrenoceptors and [3H]prazosin binding to cloned human alpha1A- and alpha1B-adrenoceptors. Inhibition of phenylephrine-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate formation by cloned receptors was also investigated.", "Up to the highest concentration which could be tested, preparations of beta-sitosterol, stinging nettle, and medicinal pumpkin were without consistent inhibitory effect in all assays. In contrast, all tested saw palmetto extracts inhibited radioligand binding to human alpha1-adrenoceptors and agonist-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation. Saturation binding experiments in the presence of a single saw palmetto extract concentration indicated a noncompetitive antagonism. The relationship between active concentrations in vitro and recommended therapeutic doses for the saw palmetto extracts was slightly lower than that for several chemically defined alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists.", "Saw palmetto extracts have alpha1-adrenoceptor-inhibitory properties. If bioavailability and other pharmacokinetic properties of these ingredients are similar to those of the chemically defined alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists, alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism might be involved in the therapeutic effects of these extracts in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, University of Essen, Germany. mark.goepel@uni-essen.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Goepel", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hecker", "ForeName": "U", "Initials": "U"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Krege", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00fcbben", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Michel", "ForeName": "M C", "Initials": "MC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Prostate", "NlmUniqueID": "8101368", "ISSNLinking": "0270-4137"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sitosterols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5LI01C78DD", "NameOfSubstance": "gamma-sitosterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioligand Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sitosterols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "12"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "12"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10068345", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0045(19990215)38:3<208::aid-pros5>3.0.co;2-4", "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0045(19990215)38:3<208::AID-PROS5>3.0.CO;2-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
