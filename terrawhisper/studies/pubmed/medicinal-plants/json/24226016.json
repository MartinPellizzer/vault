It was introduced in India from Kenya in 1931. Considerable genetic diversity has been generated over the years. Repeated clonal selection could lead to isolation of a number of divergent clones representing selective divergence. Planned hybridization among some of the chosen clones could further enlarge the spectrum of variation as measured by multivariate analyses (D(2)-statistic and canonical analysis). The resulting hybrids manifested a variable degree of heterosis which was found to be, by and large, positively associated with the degree of divergence between the two constituent parents of a hybrid. However, the choice of the potential hybrid clone(s) for commercial exploitation was most viable when parents for hybridization were short-listed on the basis of parental divergence coupled essentially with per se performance for specific traits. The latter criterion assumes greater significance since low x low or medium x low parental hybrids also tended to register high heterosis for both the pyrethrins content and yield. Four hybrids: 234xL, 8xL, 326\u00d7395 and 319xL were identified to be the most promising for clonal selection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, 16, Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "S P", "Initials": "SP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "J R", "Initials": "JR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Theor Appl Genet", "NlmUniqueID": "0145600", "ISSNLinking": "0040-5752"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Genetics. 1965 Jul;52(1):139-44", "ArticleIdList": ["17248265"]}, {"Citation": "Theor Appl Genet. 1988 Sep;76(3):352-60", "ArticleIdList": ["24232198"]}, {"Citation": "J Am Mosq Control Assoc. 1985 Sep;1(3):363-8", "ArticleIdList": ["3880253"]}, {"Citation": "Genetics. 1966 Feb;53(2):269-74", "ArticleIdList": ["5913285"]}], "ReferenceList": []}], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "7", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["24226016", "10.1007/BF00266668"]}}]}
