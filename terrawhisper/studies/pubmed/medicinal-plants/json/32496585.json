The structures of the isolated components were established and confirmed by spectroscopic analyses, including the ESI-HRMS and NMR spectroscopic investigations. Biological evaluation was performed by using an in vitro assay with liver bovine purified arginase and by an ex vivo aortic ring study.", "We demonstrated that a phenolic extract from the leaves of M.\u00a0alba possesses mammalian arginase inhibitory capacities. Investigation of the chemical constituents of its leaves results in the isolation and identification of ten compounds investigated in vitro for their arginase inhibitory capacities. Four compounds showed significant inhibition of arginase, with percentage inhibition ranging from 54% to 83% at 100\u00a0\u00b5m.
