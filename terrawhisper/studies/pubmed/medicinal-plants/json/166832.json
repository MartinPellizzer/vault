The affinity of glycyrrhetinic acid for mineralocorticoid receptors has been studied by several types of competition experiments. When rat kidney slices were incubated with 2 times 10- minus 9 M [3H]aldosterone, glycyrrhetinic acid (2 times 10- minus 5 M) was able to compete with aldosterone for the cytosolic receptor and to decrease the formation of a chromatin-[3Hi1 aldosterone-receptor complex. In cytosol, in vitro, 6 times 10- minus 4 M glycyrrhetinic acid was able to inhibit aldosterone binding by 70 percent, whereas the same dose produced only a 20 percent inhibition of dexamethasone binding. The apparent KDiss of glycyrrhetinic acid for the mineralocorticoid receptor was 2 times 10- minus 6 M. That glycyrrhetinic acid appeared to compete mainly with mineralocorticoid receptors was confirmed by sedimentation in the sucrose gradients: [3H]Aldosterone specifically bound to an 8 S peak was displaced by 5 times 10- minus 5 M glycyrrhetinic acid, whereas the [3H]dexamethasone peak was not affected by this compound. Glycyrrhizic acid showed no significant affinity for mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid kidney receptor sites. Glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizic acid had no affinity for rat cortisol binding globulin. Glycyrrhetinic acid has a low but definite affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors and thus appears to have a direct mineralocorticoid action. The low affinity of this compound for mineralocorticoid receptors is in good agreement with the very high doses required to exhibit its biological activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ulmann", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Menard", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Corvol", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Endocrinology", "NlmUniqueID": "0375040", "ISSNLinking": "0013-7227"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mineralocorticoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10028-17-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Tritium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4964P6T9RB", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7S5I7G3JQL", "NameOfSubstance": "Dexamethasone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9010-38-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcortin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "W980KJ009P", "NameOfSubstance": "Corticosterone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Aldosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding, Competitive"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Nucleus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Corticosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytosol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dexamethasone"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycyrrhiza"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mineralocorticoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Cell Surface"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Transcortin"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tritium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1975", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["166832", "10.1210/endo-97-1-46"]}}]}
