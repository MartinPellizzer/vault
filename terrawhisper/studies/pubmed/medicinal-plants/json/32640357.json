Hence, the antiproliferative potential of cirsilineol has been established in NCIH-520\u00a0cells. Cirsilineol exhibited good binding-energy and inhibited the activity of ODC, CATD, DHFR, HYAL, LOX-5, and COX-2 up to 45.14% at 100\u00a0\u03bcM. It significantly inhibited the proliferation of NCIH-520\u00a0cells (81.96%) and likewise, the proliferation of other cell lines up to 48.50%. It also induced an increase in the sub-diploid cell population, which then leads to an increase in apoptosis by 2.64 and 5.12 fold at 10\u00a0\u03bcM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Further, the Annexin-V-FITC assay confirmed the late apoptosis and necrosis in the NCIH-520\u00a0cell line induced by cirsilineol. The ROS production was enhanced by 1.16 and 2.22 folds at 10\u00a0\u03bcM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Besides, cirsilineol revealed acceptable ADME properties, non-toxic and non-mutagenic compound. Altogether, these findings provide evidence that cirsilineol inhibited the proliferation of NCIH-520\u00a0cells by inducing ROS-mediated apoptosis and offer new insight into the anti-proliferative potential of cirsilineol, which can further be exploited to either synthesise new derivatives or its candid usage as a herbal lead for cancer treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
