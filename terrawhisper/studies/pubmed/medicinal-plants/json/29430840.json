The chemical components of the water extract have been reported and the cardioprotective effects of the injection have been evaluated. However, the chemical constituents of the injection and their correlations with its pharmacological effects have not been established. In this study, 13 chemical constituents of the injection have been identified or characterized by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Besides, the potentially active compounds of this preparation that directly act on cardiac cells have been screened by cell extraction and ultra high performance liquid chromatography targeted multiple reaction monitoring. As a result, eight potentially active compounds, danshensu (1), ligustrazine hydrochloride (4), salvianolic acid I/H (7), lithospermic acid (8), salvianolic acid D (9), rosmarinic acid (10), salvianolic acid B (12), and salvianolic acid C (13), were obtained and structurally characterized from the 11 target compounds used for screening. The liquid chromatography with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography with multiple reaction monitoring tandem mass spectrometry combination method has demonstrated its potency for the screening, detection, and structural identification of bioactive compounds in a complex matrix."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
