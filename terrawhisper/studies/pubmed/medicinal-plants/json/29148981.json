The present work was therefore undertaken with an aim to scientifically validate this claim. As such, we evaluated the effect of the aqueous extract from walnut leaves on biomolecules related to fertility in adult male rats and its mode of action as fertility-enhancing agent. Methods Twenty-five rats were randomly divided into five groups of five animals each; Group 1 served as control and received normal (0.9%) saline only; Groups II, III, IV received 50, 500, 1,000 mg/kg body weight (BW) of T. conophorum leaf extract orally, while Group V served as standard and was given suspension of clomiphene citrate orally at the dose of 1.04 mg/kg/ml BW. The extract and drug were given daily and the experiment lasted for 21 consecutive days. Results The testicular biochemical parameters in treated groups showed significant (p<0.05) increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity activity, Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6PDH) activity, glycogen content, 3\u03b2 and 17\u03b2 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities and testicular and epididymal Zn and Se contents with a significant decrease in cholesterol content. A significant increase in testis weight and epididymis weight were also observed. Also, a significant (p<0.05) increase in the level of serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, sperm count, motility, viability and a decrease in sperm abnormality were observed in the various treated groups when compared with the control group. This increment was concentration dependent, while the extract at the highest concentration showed a more pronounced effect than the standard drug. Also, no sperm DNA fragmentation index was found in all the treatment groups. Photomicrographs from light and scanning electron microscopy showed large fenestrae of interstitial tissue, large fluid space and intact seminiferous epithelium layers fully packed with spermatogenic cells in treated groups than the control group. Conclusions The present study has demonstrated that Tetracarpidium conophorum leaf possesses fertility-enhancing property and have useful effects on spermatogenesis and sperm parameters in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemist, Ekiti State University, P.M.B 5363, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemist, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Akomolafe", "ForeName": "Seun F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemist, Federal University of Technology, Akure, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Oboh", "ForeName": "Ganiyu", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Complement Integr Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101313855", "ISSNLinking": "1553-3840"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertility Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3XMK78S47O", "NameOfSubstance": "Testosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-68-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H6241UJ22B", "NameOfSubstance": "Selenium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "J41CSQ7QDS", "NameOfSubstance": "Zinc"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Epididymis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Follicle Stimulating Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Juglans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Selenium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Count"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sperm Motility"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatozoa"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Testis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Testosterone"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zinc"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29148981", "10.1515/jcim-2017-0076", "/j/jcim.ahead-of-print/jcim-2017-0076/jcim-2017-0076.xml"]}}]}
