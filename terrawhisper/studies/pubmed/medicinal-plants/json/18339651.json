Inheritance of these 2 traits, pollen-less anthers, and pin flowers was studied by crossing the mutants with their respective parental strains. Segregation ratios observed in F(2) and testcross generations of the cross OR-EA x OR suggested that the pollen-less anthers trait was determined by duplicate recessive genes. Data obtained from F(2) and F(3) generations of the cross involving mutant EMS 13-2 with pin flowers and its parental variety Dhawal, suggested that production of pin (mutant) and thrum (normal) flowers was under the control of inhibitory epistatic interaction between 2 independently inherited genes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Resource Centre, Allalasandra, Bangalore 560 065, India. krnpbg@yahoo.co.in"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "R N", "Initials": "RN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Baskaran", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Hered", "NlmUniqueID": "0375373", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1503"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Catharanthus"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inheritance Patterns"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Pollen"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "9", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18339651", "10.1093/jhered/esn019", "esn019"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
