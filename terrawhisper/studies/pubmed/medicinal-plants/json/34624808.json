Cochlioquinone B derivative (CoB1), purified from Salvia miltiorrhiza endophytic Bipolaris sorokiniana, affects the defense against pulmonary pathogens by regulating inflammatory responses. However, the effect of CoB1 on lung cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, we investigate the protective effects of CoB1 on lung cancer and explore its underlying mechanism.", "We examined the inhibitory effect of CoB1 on lung cancer cells (A549 cells) by MTT and colony formation assay. The effect of CoB1 on cytostatic autophagy in lung cancer cells was verified by Western blot, transmission electron microscopy, and confocal microscopy. The differentially expressed miRNAs were identified using quantitative RT-PCR. Luciferase assay and Northern blot were performed to verify the correlation between miRNA-125b and Foxp3. Protein expression in autophagy-related pathways was detected by Western blot. Xenograft tumor models were constructed to explore the inhibitory effect of CoB1 and the role of miRNA-125b as a suppressor in lung cancer in vivo.", "CoB1 inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation by inducing cytostatic autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. CoB1-induced autophagy was related to blocking of the PI3K/Akt1/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, CoB1 induced miR-125b expression via activating the TAK1/MKK4/JNK/Smad axis, thereby reducing Foxp3 expression and further inducing autophagy.", "This study is the first to report the specific inhibitory function of CoB1 purified from Salvia miltiorrhiza endophytic Bipolaris sorokiniana in lung cancer, which may be due to the induction of autophagy. This study provides evidence and novel insights into the anticancer efficacy of CoB1."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier GmbH.
