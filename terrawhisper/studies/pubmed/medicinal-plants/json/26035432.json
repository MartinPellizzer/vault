The crude drugs/herbs have been traditionally classified by their traditional classifications or efficacies in Kampo medicines; however, it has been difficult to establish the scientific link between experimental evidence and traditional classifications in Kampo medicine. To clarify such traditional conceptions, we tested 112 crude drugs/herbs that are major components of Kampo formulations, in the multi-pathway analysis of 10 well-studied transcriptional activities including CREB, ERSF, HIF-1\u03b1, IRFs, MYC, NF-\u03baB, p53, SMAD, SOX2, and TCF/LEF in A549 human lung cancer cells. By clustering the results of multi-pathway analysis with the Spearman rank-correlation coefficient and Ward linkage, three distinct traditional categories were significantly enriched in the major groupings, which are heat-clearing and dampness-drying herbs, acrid and warm exterior-resolving herbs, and acrid and cool exterior-resolving herbs. These results indicate that these crude drugs/herbs have similar effects on intracellular signaling and further imply that the traditional classifications of those enriched crude drugs/herbs can be supported by such experimental evidence. Collectively, our new in vitro multi-pathway analysis may be useful to clarify the mechanism of action of crude drugs/herbs and Kampo formulations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Eshima", "ForeName": "Shizuka", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Yokoyama", "ForeName": "Satoru", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Science and Technology, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan."}], "LastName": "Abe", "ForeName": "Takashi", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Hayakawa", "ForeName": "Yoshihiro", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pathogenic Biochemistry, Institute of Natural Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan."}], "LastName": "Saiki", "ForeName": "Ikuo", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "PLoS One", "NlmUniqueID": "101285081", "ISSNLinking": "1932-6203"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cluster Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Reporter"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Signal Transduction"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Competing Interests: </b>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Hijikata Y (2006) Analgesic treatment with Kampo prescription.
