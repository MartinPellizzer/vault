Wilczek], also known as mung bean, widely cultivated in a large number of countries, is an important pulse crop of Asia and is considered one of the ancestral species of the genus Vigna. Since yields of greengram have remained low across subtropical and tropical Asia, it is important to estimate genetic diversity in existing cultivars in order to see if the lack of genetic variability might be a constraining factor. In this study, 32 Indian cultivars of greengram were subjected to random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis using 21 decamer primers. A total of 267 amplification products were formed at an average of 12.71 per primer with an overall polymorphism of 64%. The extent of polymorphism was moderate to low. Jaccard similarity coefficient values ranged from 0.65 to 0.92. The cluster analysis resulted in mainly three clusters revealing greater homology between cultivars released from the same source. The results of principal components analysis also substantiated this conclusion. The close genetic similarity between the cultivars could be explained due to the high degree of commonness in their pedigrees. The narrow genetic base of the greengram cultivars revealed in the present analysis emphasises the need to exploit the large germplasm collections having diverse morphoagronomic traits in cultivar improvement programs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Research Centre on DNA Fingerprinting, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, New Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lakhanpaul", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chadha", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhat", "ForeName": "K V", "Initials": "KV"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Genetica", "NlmUniqueID": "0370740", "ISSNLinking": "0016-6707"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymorphism, Genetic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "30", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11430486", "10.1023/a:1017511918528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
