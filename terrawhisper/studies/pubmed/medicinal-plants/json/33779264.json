Spreng, also known as eaglewood, belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and has a considerably high medicinal value. It has been enlisted as the class II national key protective plant. In June 2019, about 15 percent of A. sinensis treelets in a forest area of China's Hainan province were observed to have the anthracnose symptoms. The diseased spots on leaves of A. sinensis treelets were usually round or irregular with pale yellow edges. The color of the center of the lesion was firstly light brown and then black or yellowish-brown. Small pieces of tissue from the edge of the leaf spots were surface sterilized in 75% alcohol for the 60s, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and then cultivated at 28 \u00b0C in darkness on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. One fungus was systematically isolated to get pure cultures. The culturing of the three isolates was carried out in PDA media at 28 \u00b0C for a week. The average diameter of the collateral colony was 6.80 \u00b10.60 cm. Initially, the fungal colonies were white aerial mycelium and the central area of the colonies slowly turned jacinth. After seven days, the central mycelium turns grayish-green and the colonies' undersurfaces were grey to white. The colony's surfaces were fluffy and round with smooth edges. Conidia were cylindrical, smooth, and transparent, with a slight indentation in the middle and uneven distribution of small particles inside, 12.5-20.6\u00d73.5-6.8 \u00b5m (ave=15.9\u00b11.40\u00d75.18\u00b11.07, n=50). Appressoria were typically elliptic or irregular and brown to dark brown. The isolates were characterized as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex on the basis of the conidial morphology and culture representation, (Deng et al. 2017; Weir et al. 2012). To further verify the identification of the species, CX-0301, the isolated representative strains were extracted for genomic DNA. mating type 1-2-1 (Mat-1-2-1) ApMat, actin (ACT) gene, chitin synthase (CHS), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) gene were amplified using the primer pairs VcaMat-5F/VcaMat-5R, ACT-512F/ACT-783R, CHS-1-79F/CHS-1-354R, and TUB2-T1/Bt2b, respectively (Damm et al. 2012; Du et al. 2005). The homologous sequences of MN310694, MN310693, MN310692, and MN310691 were submitted to GenBank. These genes have \u2265a 97% sequence similarity to the genes of Colletotrichum aenigma (MG717319.1, MG717317.1, MH476565.1, MH853679.1, respectively) in GenBank. These morphological and molecular characteristics identified that the pathogen is C. aenigma. (Weir et al. 2012). To further verify the isolated pathogen, the pathogenicity test was performed on uninfected healthy 2-year-old eaglewood seedlings. The conidial suspension (1\u00d7106 conidia/ml) of 5ml was sprayed on both surfaces of 10 leaves of plants of the same age and height and the controls were treated solely with distilled water (Deng et al. 2017). Upon completion of inoculation, plants were kept under greenhouse conditions with an assigned temperature of 28 \u00b1 2\u00b0C while keeping relative humidity to 90% on a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regime. Anthracnose-like symptoms were observed 6 days postinoculation. The control plant tissues remained healthy. Follow up reisolation of C. enigma culture was obtained in PDA agar plates from leaf infected lesions, and the morphological features were found to be consistent with that of CX-0301 isolate, satisfying Koch's postulates. Based on the characterized information, it is the first report of Colletotrichum aenigma responsible for causing leaf spots on Aquilaria sinensis in China. Thereby, this provides a theoretical reference for the research and control of anthracnose on A. sinensis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central South University of forestry science and technologychangsha, China, 413400; 2538718472@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cong", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changsha, China; KJC9620@163.COM."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jun Ang", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Changsha, China; gyzhou2118@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Guo Ying", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "29", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "31"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["33779264", "10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2381-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
