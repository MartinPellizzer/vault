According to the results of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and microscopic examination, 0.5 or 1 mM DAS treatment did not have any adverse effects on the viability of hepatocytes. Intracellular GSH contents of cells treated with 0.5 and 1 mM DAS (58.6 and 66.4 nmol GSH/mg protein, respectively) were higher than in the controls (54.2 nmol GSH/mg protein), around 8-23%, at 24 hr of incubation; a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed for 1 mM DAS treatment at 48 hr. This phenomenon is beneficial to the detoxification and antioxidation capabilities of hepatocytes. Further, when the hepatocytes were treated with 0.5 or 1 mM DAS, the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd) were almost the same as those of the controls. On the other hand, treatment with 5 mM DAS was associated with a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in cell viability, namely in increased LDH leakage (50% at 24-hr treatment), significant changes in the morphology of the hepatocytes, low intracellular GSH level (45% lower than in the controls at 24-hr treatment), and low activities of GST, GPx and Grd."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, China Medical College, Taichung, Taiwan, Republic of China."}], "LastName": "Sheen", "ForeName": "L Y", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lii", "ForeName": "C K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sheu", "ForeName": "S F", "Initials": "SF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "R H", "Initials": "RH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tsai", "ForeName": "S J", "Initials": "SJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8207483", "ISSNLinking": "0278-6915"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60G7CF7CWZ", "NameOfSubstance": "allyl sulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.27", "NameOfSubstance": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.9", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GAN16C9B8O", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Separation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Survival"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "L-Lactate Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "enzymology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Phase-Contrast"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9012772", "10.1016/s0278-6915(96)00066-x", "S027869159600066X"]}}]}
