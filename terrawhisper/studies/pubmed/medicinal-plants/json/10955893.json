The first (L1) and third (L3) stages of deer lungworm (Dictyocaulus viviparus), and the third stage (L3) of deer gastrointestinal nematodes were incubated with tannins extracted from Lotus pedunculatus, Lotus corniculatus, sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and sainfoin (Onobrychus viciifolia). The tannins extracted from all the forages had inhibitory activity as measured by their ability to paralyse the larvae and inhibit them from passing through sieves. At the highest concentration used (1200 microg/ml) the tannins extracted from sainfoin had the highest activity against ensheathed L1 lungworm larvae (58 per cent), followed by L. pedunculatus (45 per cent), sulla (42 per cent) and L. comiculatus (35 per cent) when the larvae were incubated at 37 degrees C. The same trend, but with lower activities, was observed when the larvae were incubated at 22 degrees C. Anthelmintic activity against L3 lungworm larvae was evaluated by measuring the death rate of ensheathed L3 larvae after incubation with condensed tannins for two, 24 and 48 hours at room temperature (22 degrees C). The death rate was significantly higher (P<0.001) after 48 hours incubation than after two hours or 24 hours, and significantly higher (P<0.001) after 24 hours than after two hours incubation. Condensed tannins from sainfoin had the highest inhibitory activity followed by L. pedunculatus, sulla and L. comiculatus. The tannins from sainfoin also had the highest activity against L3 larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes, followed by L. pedunculatus, sulla and L. comiculatus. Exsheathed larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes were significantly more susceptible to the action of the tannins than ensheathed larvae."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Group, AgResearch, Grasslands Research Centre, Palmerston North, New Zealand."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Molan", "ForeName": "A L", "Initials": "AL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hoskin", "ForeName": "S O", "Initials": "SO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barry", "ForeName": "T N", "Initials": "TN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McNabb", "ForeName": "W C", "Initials": "WC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Vet Rec", "NlmUniqueID": "0031164", "ISSNLinking": "0042-4900"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tannins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Deer"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Dictyocaulus"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Dictyocaulus Infections"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Larva"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Nematoda"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "veterinary"], "DescriptorName": "Nematode Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Edible"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tannins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10955893", "10.1136/vr.147.2.44"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
