Roots of 15-day-old seedlings were treated with PEG, and leaves were studied. With the duration of PEG treatment, changes in the lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and glutathione reductase as well as contents of hydrogen peroxide and beta-N-oxalyl-L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP) were assayed. The results indicate that with the duration of PEG treatment, activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase decreased, whereas contents of hydrogen peroxide and ODAP, extent of lipid peroxidation, and activity of glutathione reductase increased. Both diethyldithiocarbamate and aminotriazole strongly inhibit activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase, respectively. At same time, the extent of lipid peroxidation was obviously increased. However, mannitol decreased the extent of lipid peroxidation. Diethyldithiocarbamate, aminotriazole, and mannitol do not affect the accumulation of ODAP. The observations suggest that there is no direct relationship between the accumulation of ODAP and the metabolism of free radicals. In addition, the relationship between water stress and ODAP accumulation in grass pea is discussed."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The State Key Laboratory of Arid Agroecology and The State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, People's Republic of China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Xing", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ji", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Z", "Initials": "Z"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Agric Food Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0374755", "ISSNLinking": "0021-8561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1TG777QI25", "NameOfSubstance": "oxalyldiaminopropionic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.6", "NameOfSubstance": "Catalase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.11.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Peroxidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.15.1.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.8.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids, Diamino"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catalase"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peroxidase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxide Dismutase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "15", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11170580", "10.1021/jf000912k", "jf000912k"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
