The biochar amendment in soil altered the fate of this herbicide by modifying the soil properties. The present study examines the dissipation and toxicity of atrazine in three contrasting soils (silty clay, sandy loam, and sandy clay) without and with biochar amendment (4%). The experiment was performed for 150 days with three application rates of atrazine (4, 8, and 10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup>). The speciation and degradation of atrazine, metabolite content, microbial biomass, and enzymatic activities were evaluated in all treatments. Three kinetic models and soil enzyme index were calculated to scrutinize the degradation of atrazine and its toxicity on soil biota, respectively. The goodness of fit statistical indices suggested that the first-order double exponential decay (FODE) model best described the degradation of atrazine in silty clay soil. However, a single first order with plateau (SFOP) was best fitted for atrazine degradation in sandy loam and sandy clay soils. The half-life of atrazine was higher in sandy clay soil (27-106 day<sup>-1</sup>) than silty clay (28-77 day<sup>-1</sup>) and sandy loam soil (27-83 day<sup>-1</sup>). The variations in the dissipation kinetics and half-life of the atrazine in three soil were associated with atrazine partitioning, availability of mineral content (silica, aluminum, and iron), and soil microbial biomass carbon. Biochar amendment significantly reduced the plateau in the kinetic curve and also reduced the atrazine toxicity on soil microbiota. Overall, biochar was more effective in sandy clay soil for the restoration of soil microbial activities under atrazine stress due to modulation in the pH and more improved soil quality."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
