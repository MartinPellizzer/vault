Red blood cell (RBC) delivery vehicles and red blood cell membrane (RBCm)-camouflaged vehicles were commonly used strategies for drug delivery. We prepared shikonin-encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles (PLGA/SK) with different surface charges to obtain both RBC delivery and RBCm-camouflaged PLGA NPs. The physicochemical properties, in vivo circulation and antitumor effects of these biomimetic preparations were studied. Since the positive PLGA NPs may affect the morphology and function of RBCs, the biomimetic preparations prepared by the negative PLGA NPs showed better in vitro stability. However, positive PLGA NP-based biomimetic preparations exhibited longer circulation time and higher tumor region accumulation, leading to stronger anti-tumor effects. Meanwhile, the RBC delivery PLGA(+) NPs possessed better in vitro cytotoxicity, longer circulation time and higher tumor accumulation than RBCm-camouflaged PLGA(+) NPs. Collectively, RBC delivery vehicles possessed more potential than RBCm-camouflaged vehicles on drug delivery for tumor treatment, especially with positive NPs-loaded."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
