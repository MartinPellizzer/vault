In all, 36 young men were used. Common bean protein digestibility was significantly lower than that observed from meat, and similar to the digestibility of a textured vegetable protein soy protein product. It was also observed that forms of consumption may affect protein digestibility of beans. Using a short-term multiple intake protein quality assay method, it was found that feeding beans alone, N equilibrium was reached with an intake of 114 mg N/kg/day, while when fed with maize in a 87:13 ratio, N equilibrium was reached with 98 mg N/kg/day. This was attributed to both a complementary protein effect and an increase in protein digestibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Navarrete", "ForeName": "D A", "Initials": "DA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bressani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Am J Clin Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0376027", "ISSNLinking": "0002-9165"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N762921K75", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1981", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7282614", "10.1093/ajcn/34.9.1893"]}}]}
