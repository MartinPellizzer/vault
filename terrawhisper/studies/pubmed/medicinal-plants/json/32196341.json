The compounds thymol and carvacrol are structurally related odorants commonly found in plants and foods such as thyme and oregano, also having a significant contribution to their overall aroma. However, a systematic elucidation of the sensory properties in this class of oxygenated, aromatic monoterpenoids has not been carried out. To close this gap and gain new insights into structure-odor relationships leading to pencil-like and woody odors, 19 structurally related derivatives of <i>p</i>-cymene starting from thymol and carvacrol were synthesized and characterized. The compounds had odor thresholds ranging from 2.0 ng/L air to 388.8 ng/L air, being lowest for thymol and carvacrol and highest for thymohydroquinone. The compounds smelled mostly thyme-like, oregano-like, and pencil-like with phenolic, earthy, and medicinal variations in their odor character, which could be successfully linked to structural motifs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aroma and Smell Research, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Henkestra\u00dfe 9, 91054 Erlangen, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sensory Analytics, Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging (IVV), Giggenhauser Stra\u00dfe 35, 85354 Freising, Germany."}], "LastName": "Schreiner", "ForeName": "Linda", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aroma and Smell Research, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Henkestra\u00dfe 9, 91054 Erlangen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Bauer", "ForeName": "Johannes", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sensory Analytics, Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging (IVV), Giggenhauser Stra\u00dfe 35, 85354 Freising, Germany."}], "LastName": "Ortner", "ForeName": "Eva", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-6205-5125"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Aroma and Smell Research, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Henkestra\u00dfe 9, 91054 Erlangen, Germany."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sensory Analytics, Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging (IVV), Giggenhauser Stra\u00dfe 35, 85354 Freising, Germany."}], "LastName": "Buettner", "ForeName": "Andrea", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cymenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1G1C8T1N7Q", "NameOfSubstance": "4-cymene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S88TT14065", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cymenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocarbons, Aromatic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis", "chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Odorants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygen"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Sensory Thresholds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32196341", "10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00339"]}}]}
