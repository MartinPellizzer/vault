Lupeol, a phytosterol from medicinal plants, has potential anti-cancer properties. This study investigated lupeol's protective effects against PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced lung damage. Mice received lupeol following intratracheal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure. Results showed lupeol reduced lung damage, lowered wet/dry (W/D) weight ratio, and suppressed increased permeability caused by PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Additionally, lupeol decreased plasma inflammatory cytokines, total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Lupeol also reduced expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and autophagy-related proteins microtubule-associated protein 1\u00a0A/1\u00a0B-light chain 3 (LC3) II and Beclin 1, while increasing phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation. These findings suggest lupeol's potential as a therapeutic agent for PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced lung damage via modulation of the TLR4-MyD88 and mTOR-autophagy pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
