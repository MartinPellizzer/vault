Matricaria chamomilla accumulation of soil cadmium (Cd, 0, 10 and 40\u00a0mg/kg) and lead (Pb, 0, 60 and 180\u00a0mg/kg) affecting plant biochemical properties L. at different growth stages in the greenhouse and field was investigated. The 10-kg experimental pots (located in the greenhouse and field with 80% of field capacity moisture) were filled with the treated soils, and were planted with M. chamomilla L. seeds (three replicates). Plants were sampled to determine their biochemical properties including Cd and Pb contents, pigments, proline (Pro), leaf relative water (LRW), lipid peroxidation (LX), and superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15. 1.1), and catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activities. Soil final concentration of Cd and Pb was also determined. Heavy metal stress significantly decreased plant pigment contents; however, it significantly increased plant PRO, LRW, LX and SOD, and not CAT. Heavy metal, growth stage, growth location, and their interactions significantly affected plant heavy metal concentrations. Interestingly, although significantly higher concentration of Cd was observed in plant aerial part under greenhouse conditions, plant roots had significantly higher concentrations of Cd under field conditions, and it was reverse for Pb. Increased concentration of Cd and Pb significantly enhanced plant Pro content and the highest one was resulted by Pb3 (913.46\u00a0mg/g fresh weight) significantly higher than other treatments including Cd3 (595.34\u00a0mg/g fresh weight). M. chamomilla is a suitable species for the bioremediation of soils polluted with Cd and Pb."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021.
