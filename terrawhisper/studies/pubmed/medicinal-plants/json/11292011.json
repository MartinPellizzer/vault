Psychological effects were first noted after 30-60 min, peaked between 60-120 min, and were resolved by 240 min. The tea was well tolerated from a cardiovascular point of view, with a trend toward increase for systolic blood pressure. Modified physical sensations and nausea were the most frequently reported somatic-dysphoric effects. The overall experience was regarded as pleasant and satisfactory by five of the six volunteers, while one volunteer experienced an intensely dysphoric reaction with transient disorientation and anxiety at the medium dose and voluntarily withdrew from the study.", "Ayahuasca can be described as inducing changes in the perceptual, affective, cognitive, and somatic spheres, with a combination of stimulatory and visual psychoactive effects of longer duration and milder intensity than those previously reported for intravenously administered DMT."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Area d'Investigaci\u00f3 Farmacol\u00f2gica, Institut de Recerca, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, St. Antoni Maria Claret, Barcelona, Spain."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Riba", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodr\u00edguez-Fornells", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Urbano", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Morte", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antonijoan", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Montero", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Callaway", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barbanoj", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "NlmUniqueID": "7608025", "ISSNLinking": "0033-3158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hallucinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WUB601BHAA", "NameOfSubstance": "N,N-Dimethyltryptamine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hallucinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "N,N-Dimethyltryptamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "South America"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "22", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11292011", "10.1007/s002130000606"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
