A Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 12.0.", "Thirty-eight studies were included in this study, with a total of 3757 patients. It was found that adding Xiaoke Decoction could improve total efficiency. The Xiaoke Decoction groups surpassed the western medicine groups regarding improvement in total efficiency (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.49; 95% CI: 2.78-4.39, <i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Adding Xiaoke Decoction could lower the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level. The Xiaoke Decoction groups surpassed the western medicine groups regarding reduction in FPG levels (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.14; 95% CI: -1.36 to 0.92, <i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Adding Xiaoke Decoction could lower the 2\u00a0h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG) level. The Xiaoke Decoction groups surpassed the western medicine groups regarding reduction in 2hPG (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-1.40; 95% CI: -1.61 to 1.19, <i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Adding Xiaoke Decoction could lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The Xiaoke Decoction groups surpassed the western medicine groups regarding reduction in HbA1c (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.77; 95% CI: -0.95 to 0.58, <i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). It was found that adding Xiaoke Decoction could lower the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome score. The TCM syndrome scores among patients in the Xiaoke Decoction group were lower than those among patients in the control group after treatment (MD\u00a0=\u00a0-4.90; 95% CI: -7.22 to 2.57, <i>P</i>\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). At the same time, we conducted a subgroup and sensitivity analysis of age and intervention duration on the heterogeneity of total efficiency, FPG, 2hPG, HbAlc, and TCM syndrome score outcome indicators.
