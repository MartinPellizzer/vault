Media containing the five legumes alone or in combination with Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI) were tested. With the exception of heat-sterilized black beans and adzuki beans, S. aureus growth was excellent in all media with cell counts after 48 h (25 degrees C) exceeding 10(8) cfu/ml. In black beans and adzuki beans cell counts were 1-2 log-cycles lower. Enterotoxin A was produced in amounts of 33 to 72 ng/ml in BHI after 48 h. Almost no toxin was produced in the four different beans following heat or irradiation treatment; in peas the toxin concentration reached 14 to 15 ng/ml. In the medium prepared from irradiated soybeans and BHI the final toxin concentration was about the same as in BHI alone. In all the other media consisting of a combination of legumes with BHI toxin concentrations were three to four times higher than in BHI alone. Production of thermonuclease showed variation and did not always correlate with enterotoxin production."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Food Microbiology, University of Bonn, F.R.G."}], "LastName": "Neumayr", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kr\u00e4mer", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Int J Food Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8412849", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1605"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Culture Media"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enterotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37337-57-8", "NameOfSubstance": "enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.31.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Micrococcal Nuclease"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture Media"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Enterotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Micrococcal Nuclease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2397154", "10.1016/0168-1605(90)90070-l", "0168-1605(90)90070-L"]}}]}
