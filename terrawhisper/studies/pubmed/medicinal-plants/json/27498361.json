In an endotoxin (LPS) control group, each mouse was challenged with 1\u00a0mg LPS/kg by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. In high-, middle- and low-dose alkaloid groups, mice were initially challenged with 1\u00a0mg LPS/kg by IP injection and, 3\u00a0h later, dosed intramuscularly (IM) with one of the six alkaloids at one of three levels (1, 5, or 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight). In the drug control group, mice were dosed IM with 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight of a given alkaloid; mice in a na\u00efve control group were administered the same volume of normal saline. The results revealed the six alkaloids could reduce the incidence/severity of LPS- induced toxicities, e.g., body temperature elevation, weight loss, systemic inflammation, multiple organ dysfunction. Taken together, the data suggested to us that these alkaloids might effectively regulate inflammatory responses and have a potential to be used in anti-endotoxin therapies."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
