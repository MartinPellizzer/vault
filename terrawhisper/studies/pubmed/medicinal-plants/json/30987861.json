The common feature for all tested anti-inflammatory plants extracts was related to downregulation of ALOX12, which was also associated with neuroprotective action of these medicinal plants as well as their potential benefits in neurodegenerative diseases. None of tested anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic plants selectively activated the ALOX15-mediated signaling pathway, which is associated with generation anti-inflammatory lipoxins. Almost all tested plants upregulated the expression of the prostaglandin E receptor 3 gene (PTGER3) suggesting their potential benefits in the treatment of cancer.", "Every single plant tested in this study revealed a specific \"signature\" on eicosanoid signaling-related gene expression, regardless of their common features as anti-inflammatory or adaptogenic activity.
