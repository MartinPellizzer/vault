RNA 1 (5706 nucleotides) has strong sequence similarity with members of the luteovirus group, a similarity that is also manifested in the symptomatology, cytopathology and vector transmission of this virus. RNA 2 (4253 nucleotides) is hypothesized to facilitate systemic invasion and mechanical transmission, attributes that distinguish PEMV from the phloem-limited luteoviruses. Sequence analysis of RNA 2 has demonstrated that PEMV is unique among multicomponent viruses in that it lacks 3'- and 5'-terminal homology between its genomic RNAs. Sequence analysis of RNA 2 has identified an open reading frame encoding a putative product of 65K that contains a series of polymerase-like motifs typical of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This protein sequence lacks homology with the polymerase encoded on RNA 1 of PEMV, instead being more closely affiliated with the polymerases of viruses related to the carmo- and tombusvirus groups. Inoculation of pea protoplasts with RNA transcripts derived from a full-length cDNA clone of RNA 2 has demonstrated that RNA 2 replicates autonomously in the absence of RNA 1, although comparable inoculation of whole plants failed to establish a systemic infection. There is no evidence that RNA 2 encodes structural proteins, suggesting that encapsidation functions are supplied in trans by RNA 1, comparable to the helper-dependent complexes occurring within the luteovirus group. These data suggest that the PEMV genome can be characterized as a symbiotic association of two taxonomically distinct viral RNAs cooperatively interacting in the establishment of a systemic virus infection."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824-1312."}], "LastName": "Demler", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rucker", "ForeName": "D G", "Initials": "DG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Zoeten", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Gen Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0077340", "ISSNLinking": "0022-1317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Viral Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Electron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Open Reading Frames"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Viral Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Virus Replication"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8423443", "10.1099/0022-1317-74-1-1"]}}]}
