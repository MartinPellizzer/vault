This paper presents the results of a questionnaire together with clinical oral findings among first generation Bangladeshi women aged over 25 years. The majority chewed betel quid with tobacco, were of rural origin, used traditional oral hygiene practices and had never visited a dentist. Of the 247 examined, only one was edentulous. A very low level of caries experience was recorded, a mean DFT score of 1.87 at 25-34 years of age, with an average of 1.05 missing teeth. Coronal caries experience was found to be independent of oral hygiene methods, including the use of fluoride toothpaste, or the frequency of betel quid chewing. It was concluded that Bangladeshi adult women have considerably lower levels of caries experience and tooth loss than United Kingdom adults as represented in recent national surveys."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Leeds Dental Institute, UK."}], "LastName": "Williams", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Summers", "ForeName": "R M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Prendergast", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Community Dent Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8411261", "ISSNLinking": "0265-539X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Bangladesh"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Communication Barriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DMF Index"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Caries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Educational Status"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "England"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Language"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods", "statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Oral Hygiene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Regression Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tobacco, Smokeless"}, {"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "Tooth Loss"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8897738"]}}]}
