The inhibitory compound was identified as 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde by analysis with FT-IR, FAB-Mass, EI-Mass, (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde inhibited the phosphotransferase activity of CKII with IC(50) of about 783 microM. Steady-state studies revealed that the inhibitor acts as a competitive inhibitor with respect to the substrate ATP. A value of 138.6 microM was obtained for the apparent K(i). Concentration of 300 microM 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde caused 50% growth inhibition of human cancer cell U937. 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde-induced cell death was characterised with the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and procaspase-3. Furthermore, the inhibitor induced the fragmentation of DNA into multiples of 180 bp, indicating that it triggered apoptosis. This induction of apoptosis by 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde was also confirmed by using flow cytometry analysis. Since CKII is involved in cell proliferation and oncogenesis, these results suggest that 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde may function by inhibiting oncogenic disease, at least in part, through the inhibition of CKII activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Bang Hyo", "Initials": "BH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "Soo-Hyun", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Yun-Sook", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sang Kook", "Initials": "SK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Moon", "ForeName": "Byong Jo", "Initials": "BJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bae", "ForeName": "Young-Seuk", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4PVP2HCH4T", "NameOfSubstance": "protocatechualdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Casein Kinase II"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Casein Kinase II"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "11", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19023807", "10.1080/14786410802076333", "905739960"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
