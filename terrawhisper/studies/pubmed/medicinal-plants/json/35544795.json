The endemic species Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels is an important crucial plant used by the local population to treat many diseases and prepare some authentic foods. To identify the therapeutic uses of the Argan tree [Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels] and their benefits in preparing authentic foods, the survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires. We have achieved 450 interviews with traditional health practitioners and knowledgeable villagers. In the region of Chtouka A\u00eft Baha and Tiznit (Western Anti-Atlas). In parallel with this survey, we collected some old local manuscripts from conventional practitioners in the region. The data obtained were analyzed using specific ethnobotanical indices such as Use Value (UV), Fidelity Level (FL), and Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC). In parallel, we analyzed the nutritional value of some authentic foods derived the argan oil (Amlou, Tagoulla, and Labsis). All 450 interviewees use the argan oil in food or for the preparation of their authentic foods derived (Amlou, Tagoulla, and Labsis); among them, 100 persons use Argan, in addition to food, in the treatment of various diseases with UV and RFC at 1.94 and 0.22, respectively. Among eight treated diseases by argan tree, the treatment of skin and subcutaneous diseases had a very highly significant value of the FL index (98%). Similarly, the analysis of the manuscripts collected in the study area revealed an ancient therapeutic use of the argan tree. The results also show that the Argan oil extracted from the seed is used to prepare authentic foods with significant nutritional value, especially Amlou."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-5209-1499"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University of Settat, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Health Sciences and Technologies, Settat, Morocco."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Biotechnologies and Natural Resources Valorization, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Barkaoui", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2769-7285"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Biotechnologies and Natural Resources Valorization, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Msanda", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2849-1142"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology and Plant Protection, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Boubaker", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0927-4000"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Biotechnologies and Natural Resources Valorization, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "El-Boullani", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1444-1371"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Microbial Biotechnology and Plant Protection, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Asri", "ForeName": "O El", "Initials": "OE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8357-3880"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University, Institut des Sciences du Sport, Settat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Chokri", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4846-8537"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Ibn Zohr, Faculty of Sciences, Laboratory of Biotechnologies and Natural Resources Valorization, Agadir, Morocco."}], "LastName": "El-Yaagoubi", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-9684-9962"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University, Institut des Sciences du Sport, Settat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Koutaya", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1061-7787"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University, Institut des Sciences du Sport, Settat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Eloirdi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0441-6850"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University, Institut des Sciences du Sport, Settat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Arifi", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-0638-7256"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hassan First University of Settat, Higher Institute of Health Sciences, Laboratory of Health Sciences and Technologies, Settat, Morocco."}], "LastName": "Chahboune", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Braz J Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "101129542", "ISSNLinking": "1519-6984"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Morocco"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sapotaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "32"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35544795", "10.1590/1519-6984.260477", "S1519-69842024000100298"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
