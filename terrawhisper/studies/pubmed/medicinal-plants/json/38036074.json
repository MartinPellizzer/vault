It has a purple-green stem and has a unique feature and advantage of better survival in the winter season than other O. basilicum varieties, illustrating its physiological mechanisms for cold tolerance. In this study, we subjected both the CIM-Shishir variety and a control plant to cold stress to investigate the impact of low temperatures on various physiological, trichome developments, secondary metabolite constitution aspects related to essential oil production, and gene expression. The analysis revealed a significantly higher density and altered morphology of trichomes on the leaf surface of the variety subjected to low temperatures, indicating its adaptation to cold conditions. Furthermore, when comparing the treated plants under low-temperature stress, it was observed that the relative electrolyte leakage and Malondialdehyde (MDA) contents substantially increased in the control in contrast to the CIM-Shishir variety. This finding suggests that CIM-Shishir exhibits superior cold tolerance. Additionally, an increase in proline content was noted in the variety exposed to low temperatures compared to the control. Moreover, the chlorophyll and anthocyanin content gradually increased with prolonged exposure to low-temperature stress in the newly developed variety, indicating its ability to maintain photosynthetic capacity and adapt to cold conditions. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased under low-temperature conditions in the CIM-Shishir variety, further highlighting its cold tolerance behaviour. In our research, we investigated the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of cold response in Ocimum. We analyzed the expression of key genes associated with cold tolerance in two plant groups: the newly developed hybrid variety known as CIM-Shishir Ocimum, which exhibits cold tolerance, and the control plants susceptible to cold climates that include WRKY53, ICE1, HOS1, COR47, LOS15, DREB5, CBF4, LTI6, KIN, and ERD2. These genes exhibited significantly higher expression levels in the CIM-Shishir variety compared to the control, shedding light on the genetic basis of its cold tolerance. The need for climate-smart, resilient high-yielding genotype is of high importance due to varied climatic conditions as this will hit the yield drastically and further to the economic sectors including farmers and many industries that are dependent on the bioactive constituents of Ocimum."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
