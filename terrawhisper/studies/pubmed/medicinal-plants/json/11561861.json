The adults of T. castaneum were more susceptible than larvae to both contact and fumigant toxicity of 1,8-cineole, and LD50 and LC50 values of 108.4 microg/mg body weight of adult insect and 1.52 mg/liter air were found, respectively. Furthermore, 14-d-old T. castaneum larvae were more tolerant than 16- and 18-d-old larvae and adults to the contact toxicity of 1,8-cineole, but the 16- and 18-d-old larvae have similar susceptibility. In contrast, all the larvae (14-18 d old) of T. castaneum were much more tolerant than the adults to the fumigant action, but larvae of different ages had similar susceptibility. The compound 1,8-ciineole applied to filter paper at a concentration of 3.22-16.10 mg/cm2 significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the hatching of T. castaneum eggs and the subsequent survival rate of the larvae. Adult emergence was also reduced by 1,8-cineole. Feeding deterrence of 81.9% was achieved in T. castateum adults by using a concentration of 121.9 mg/g food, whereas larvae showed 68.8% at the same concentration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Genetic Resources and Biotechnology Division, Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Lucknow, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Prajapati", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aggarwal", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Econ Entomol", "NlmUniqueID": "2985127R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0493"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cyclohexanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RV6J6604TK", "NameOfSubstance": "Eucalyptol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Asteraceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Coleoptera"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Cyclohexanols"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptol"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovum"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "20", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11561861", "10.1603/0022-0493-94.4.979"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
