All mice were poured Sarcandra glabra Thunb dilution to the mice's stomach once daily from the beginning of the experiment. Then the effect was analyzed by measuring peripheral blood cell counts of the mice on the 2nd day, the 4th day and the 7th day after chemotherapy. On the end of 7th day, all mice were killed, and then bone marrow biopsy was employed to investigate the hemapoietic condition.", "Before the chemotherapy, the platelet counts of mice treated by Sarcandra glabra Thunb were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). After chemotherapy with 5-FU, the platelet counts were not significantly decreased in two all experimental groups compared with negative control group (P < 0.05), while there was not significantly different between two experimental groups (P > 0.05). Moreover the marrow biopsy showed that bone marrow hyperplasia was active in two intervention study groups with some megaryocytes in the medullary cavity of bone while bone marrow hyperplasia was low in the control group without any megaryocyte in the medullary cavity of bone.", "The Sarcandra glabra Thunb had obvious activity in treatment to therombocytopenia and can prevent thrombocytopenia by 5-FU."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Department of Hematology, Guangdong People' s Hospital, Guangzhou 510080."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Liye", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Tianhao", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Yunxian", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Xueyun", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Zesheng", "Initials": "Z"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Weng", "ForeName": "Jianyu", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Suijing", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Wei", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U3P01618RT", "NameOfSubstance": "Fluorouracil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Fluorouracil"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hematopoiesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Platelet Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "chemically induced", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Thrombocytopenia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "1", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15934240"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
