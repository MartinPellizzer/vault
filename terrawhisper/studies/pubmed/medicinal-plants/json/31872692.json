The traditional target screening methods such as the activitybased probe profiling,affinity chromatography,and protein microarray are commonly used in the past,however,which are limited in TCM due to the complexity of small molecules existed in the herbal medicine. The label-free small molecule probe is a recently well-applied technology in the target discovery of natural products,which is characterized by discovering the small molecule-protein ligation without any structural modification at the ligands,and is therefore suitable to the complex chemical constituents in TCM. Furthermore,this method is conducted on the basis of proteome,which is advanced in the discovery of new or multiple target proteins of TCM. Owing to the potential of label-free probe in the target discovery of TCM,its analytical principle,application status,and general protocol were reviewed in this paper. The label-free probe technology is anticipated to accelerate the mechanism-uncovering of TCM."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica,Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Guangzhou 510006,China Key Laboratory of Digital Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica of State Administration of Traditional Chines Medicine Guangzhou 510006,China Engineering & Technology Research Center for Chinese Materia Medica Quality of the Universities of Guangdong Province Guangzhou 510006,China."}], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Yue-Wei", "Initials": "YW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Chinese Materia Medica,Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Guangzhou 510006,China Key Laboratory of Digital Quality Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medica of State Administration of Traditional Chines Medicine Guangzhou 510006,China Engineering & Technology Research Center for Chinese Materia Medica Quality of the Universities of Guangdong Province Guangzhou 510006,China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shu-Mei", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Construction and Application of New Drug Screening Model Systems Guangzhou 510006,China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lu-Yong", "Initials": "LY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ligands"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ligands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31872692", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190419.201"]}}]}
