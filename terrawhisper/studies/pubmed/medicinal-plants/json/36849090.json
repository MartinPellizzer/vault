Plant chassis have significant advantages over microbial chassis in terms of membrane protein expression, precursor supply, product tolerance, and regionalization synthesis. Here, using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression technology, Nicotiana benthamiana, and a step-by-step screening approach, we identified nine enzymes (SSR1-3, SMO1-3, CPI-5, CYP51G, SMO2-2, C14-R-2, 8,7SI-4, C5-SD1, and 7-DR1-1) from the medicinal plant Paris polyphylla and established detailed biosynthetic routes from cycloartenol to cholesterol. Specfically, we optimized HMGR, a key gene of the mevalonate pathway, and co-expressed it with the PpOSC1 gene to achieve a high level of cycloartenol (28.79\u00a0mg/g dry weight, which is a sufficient amount of precursor for cholesterol biosynthesis) synthesis in the leaves of N. benthamiana. Subsequently, using a one-by-one elimination method we found that six of these enzymes (SSR1-3, SMO1-3, CPI-5, CYP51G, SMO2-2, and C5-SD1) were crucial for cholesterol production in N. benthamiana, and we establihed a high-efficiency cholesterol synthesis system with a yield of 5.63\u00a0mg/g dry weight. Using this strategy, we also discovered the biosynthetic metabolic network responsible for the synthesis of a common aglycon of steroidal saponin, diosgenin, using cholesterol as a substrate, obtaining a yield of 2.12\u00a0mg/g dry weight in N. benthamiana. Our study provides an effective strategy to characterize the metabolic pathways of medicinal plants that lack a system for in vivo functional verification, and also lays a foundation for the synthesis of active steroid saponins in plant chassis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 International Metabolic Engineering Society.
