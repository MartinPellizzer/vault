MetS was established by Chinese Diabetes Society. Logistic regression model was utilized to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to calculate area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 95% CIs to obtain the identification ability for MetS.", "The risk of MetS was increased with per 5 units increase of LAP (OR 1.37 [95% CI, 1.34-1.39]). Similar results were found in subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Clustered metabolic risk associated with per 5 units increase of LAP was observed for people with 1 (OR 1.59 [95% CI, 1.53-1.65]), 2 (2.15 [2.06-2.24]), 3 (2.59 [2.48-2.71]), 4 (2.81 [2.69-2.95]) and 5 (3.03 [2.87-3.21]) MetS components.
