It is a natural substance found in different rocky parts of the world, formed by plants, mineral, and animal remains gradually. There is also worthwhile evidence supporting its oral use for bone repair in Persian medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of <i>momiai</i> in tibia fracture healing. <b><i>Design:</i></b> This study is a randomized double-blinded controlled trial. <b><i>Settings/Location:</i></b> Three different hospitals in Tehran, Iran. <b><i>Subjects:</i></b> Patients with age range of 18-60 years admitted due to new tibia fracture were enrolled after meeting the inclusion criteria. <b><i>Interventions:</i></b> The patients were divided into two groups randomly and received two 500\u2009mg capsules of <i>momiai</i> or placebo for 28 days. <b><i>Outcome measures:</i></b> The process of bone healing was assessed by frequent X-ray radiographies and adverse effects were recorded. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Totally, 160 patients participated in the study either in two equal intervention or placebo groups. There was no significant difference between groups in terms of demographic and descriptive data. At the end of the study, the mean time of tibial bone union was 129 days in the experimental group, while it was 153 days in the placebo group (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.049). There was no significant difference in the reported adverse effects between the two groups (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.839). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The current study showed that oral consumption of <i>momiai</i> after tibial shaft fracture surgery could be a promising option to reduce the healing time."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad Hasan", "Initials": "SMH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini Khameneh", "ForeName": "Seyed Mehdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine and Materia Medica Research Center, School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodadoost", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Emergency Medicine, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini Kasnavieh", "ForeName": "Seyed Mohammad", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kamalinejad", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gachkar", "ForeName": "Latif", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinic of Integrative Medicine, Kliniken Essen Mitte, Medical Faculty University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany."}], "LastName": "Rampp", "ForeName": "Thomas", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Research Center for Traditional Medicine and History of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Essence of Parsiyan Wisdom Institute, Traditional Medicine and Medicinal Plant Incubator, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pasalar", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Complex Mixtures"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Complex Mixtures"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fracture Healing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "surgery"], "DescriptorName": "Tibial Fractures"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "4", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32310691", "10.1089/acm.2019.0453"]}}]}
