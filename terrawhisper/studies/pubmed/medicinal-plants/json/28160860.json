Antrodia cinnamomea (AC), a precious medicinal fungus has been traditionally used as a folk remedy for cancers in Asian countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the bioefficacy and the underlying molecular mechanisms of the AC fruiting bodies extracts (AC-3E) against human ER+ T47D breast cancer cells, and compare the effect with that of tamoxifen.", "Cell proliferation, migration, TUNEL assay, western blotting, time-lapse confocal microscopy analyses, chorioallantoic membrane assay, and a xenograft BALB/c nude mouse system were used in this study. Chemical fingerprinting of AC-3E was established using LC-MS.", "AC-3E attenuated T47D breast cancer cell activity by deregulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and key cell-cycle mediators, and inducing apoptosis. AC-3E also effectively inhibited tube-like structures of endothelial cells, blood vessel branching and microvessel formation ex vivo and in vivo. Significant preventive and therapeutic effects against T47D mammary tumor growth of AC-3E was observed comparable or superior to tamoxifen treatment in xenograft BALB/c nude mice. Dehydroeburicoic acid (2) was characterized as the main chemical constituent in AC-3E against breast cancer.", "This study suggests that AC-3E extracts can be employed as a double-barreled approach to treat human ER+ breast cancer by attacking both cancer cells and tumor-associated blood vessel cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier GmbH.
