Incidence of liver injuries caused by PAs has been reported worldwide, and the reactive metabolites of PAs are known to play a critical role in causing the hepatotoxicity. To better understand the toxicity-induction mechanisms, we explored the interactions of PA metabolites with cellular RNA molecules, and examined their effects on the biochemical and metabolic properties of hepatic RNAs. After exposure to retrorsine, adduction on adenosine and guanosine were detected in mouse liver microsomal incubations, cultured mouse primary hepatocytes, and mouse liver tissues. NMR analysis showed that the exocyclic amino group participated in the adduction. We found drastically altered properties and metabolism of the adducted RNA such as reverse-transcriptability, translatability, and RNase-susceptibility. In addition, endogenous modification of N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m6A) was remarkably reduced."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
