Addition of 2% garlic powder to diets containing aminopyrine and sodium nitrite (each at 600 mg/kg) reduced the occurrence of both 7-N-methyldeoxyguanosine (7-N-mG) and 6-O-methyldeoxyguanosine (6-O-mG) adducts to rat liver DNA by approximately 55%; and over 80% when 4% garlic was provided. Dietary supplementation with garlic powder (2 and 4%) also reduced the occurrence of 7-N-mG and 6-O-mG adducts by approximately 40 and 60% respectively, in rats intubated with N-nitrosodimethylamine (150 mg/kg body wt). The quantity of 7-N-mG and 6-O-mG adducts in mammary tissue of rats given intravenous N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (50 mg/kg body wt) was reduced over 50% in rats fed 2% garlic compared to controls. The depression in the occurrence of these adducts was approximately 70% when dietary garlic was increased to 4%. These experiments suggest the reduction in DNA adducts caused by processed garlic powder likely reflects a depression in the formation of NOC from precursors and changes in the bioactivation and/or denitrosation of NOC."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Nutrition, Pennsylvania State University, University Park 16802."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "X Y", "Initials": "XY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "J Z", "Initials": "JZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Milner", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "138-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "4-nitrosodimethylaniline"}, {"RegistryNumber": "684-93-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Methylnitrosourea"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitroso Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8313528", "10.1093/carcin/15.2.349"]}}]}
