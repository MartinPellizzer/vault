Cobra is the most common snake type in Asia and is responsible for a large number of mortalities particularly in rural areas. Plants are usually considered the most effective and easy-to-approach treatment for snake bites in rural areas of various countries. Vitex negundo L. is an important medicinal plant traditionally used to treat snake bite envenomation in many countries of Asia.", "From literature survey of plants traditionally used in the treatment of snake bites in Asian countries including India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, roots of V. negundo were selected for the present study. Anti-snake venom potential of its roots was assessed through various in vitro assays targeting the phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> enzyme.", "V. negundo roots were sequentially extracted in different organic solvents to get fractions and in methanol to get total extract. The extracts were evaluated for phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) inhibitory potential through inhibition of venom-induced hemolysis, ADP-induced platelet aggregation, PLA<sub>2</sub>-induced fatty acid hydrolysis and anticoagulant effect of cobra venom. Antioxidant power was determined using DPPH and superoxide radical scavenging assays. GC-MS and HPLC analysis was performed for the total methanol extract.", "Strong PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitory effect was observed for all the extracts. The ethyl acetate, acetone and methanol fractions significantly inhibited toxic effects of cobra venom under in vitro conditions. Radical scavenging potential of these fractions was also significantly high as compared to non-polar fractions in both DPPH and superoxide scavenging assays. Phytochemical analysis indicated high phenolic and flavonoid contents in these fractions. GC-MS and HPLC analysis of total methanol extract confirmed the presence of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, phenol, o-Guaiacol, palmitic acid-methyl ester, methyl stearate, quercetin and kaempferol in the plant.", "The study concluded that the roots of V. negundo, particularly their polar extracts, have strong PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitory effect against cobra venom confirming their traditional use to manage snake bites. The roots of this plant can be further studied for isolation of plant-based antisera."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
