Obviously, further total synthesis of rocaglaol derivatives for medical chemistry study is of great significance. Then, twenty six rocaglaol derivatives including 25 new compounds were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against three human cancer cell lines: human colon cancer cells (HCT116), colorectal cancer stem cells (P6C), and human red leukocyte leukemia cells (HEL), using MTT assay. Most of derivatives showed good cytotoxic activities, with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> being 3.2\u00a0nM for HEL cells, which was 169 times stronger than that of the positive control (doxorubicin). Further mechanism study indicated that 11k could significantly suppress MAPK pathway in HCT116 cells, which may responsible for induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
