We aimed to explore the molecular mechanism behind their effects on oxidative stress and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).", "Firstly, the ethyl acetate fraction of <i>Solena heterophylla</i> Lour. fruits was standardized using Cucurbitacin B as a standard marker by conducting HPTLC evaluation. Next, we delved into analyzing metabolite profiling. In addition, the standardized fraction was utilized in an experimental study to investigate the molecular mechanism of action in an <i>in vivo</i> high-fat diet and a low dose of streptozotocin-induced diabetic model.", "We have reportedly identified 52 metabolites in the ethyl acetate fraction of <i>Solena heterophylla</i> (EASH). In the in vitro tests, it has been observed that this extract from plants possesses notable inhibitory properties against \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase. <i>Solena heterophylla</i> fruits with high levels of Cucurbitacin B (2.29% w/w) helped lower FBG levels in animals with EASH treatment. EASH treatment reduced HbA1c levels and normalized liver lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme levels. SGOT, SGPT, and SALP serum enzyme levels also returned to normal.", "Based on the current evaluation, it was found that EASH exhibited encouraging hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats induced by a low dose of STZ and high-fat diet, which warrants further investigation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Jana", "ForeName": "Sandipan", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Product Studies, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Gayen", "ForeName": "Srijon", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Product Studies, Jadavpur University, Kolkata-700032, India."}], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "Barun Das", "Initials": "BD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Singha", "ForeName": "Seha", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Mondal", "ForeName": "Jayashree", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Imphal, 795001, India."}], "LastName": "Kar", "ForeName": "Amit", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Nepal", "ForeName": "Abhimanyu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Natural Product Studies, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 700032, India."}], "LastName": "Ghosh", "ForeName": "Suparna", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "PAPRSB Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, BE 1410 Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam."}], "LastName": "Rajabalaya", "ForeName": "Rajan", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming, 82071, USA."}], "LastName": "David", "ForeName": "Sheba R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pharmacy, MAHSA University, Bandar Saujana Putra, 42610, Jenjarom, Selangor, Malaysia."}], "LastName": "Balaraman", "ForeName": "Ashok Kumar", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacology and Drug Discovery Research Laboratory, Division of Life Sciences, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), An Autonomous Institute under -
