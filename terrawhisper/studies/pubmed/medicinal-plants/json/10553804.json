To determine the optimal clinical dosage of SS-cream on PE, we investigated the safety and efficacy of SS-cream with various doses. A double blind, randomized placebo controlled clinical study was performed.", "Fifty patients completed the study. Mean age of the patients was 37.1+/-1.O y and mean ejaculatory latency was 1.35+/-0.07 min. Sexual satisfaction rate of both the partner and patient was 16.2%. Each patient was instructed to apply the different cream (placebo, SS-cream 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 g) on glans penis 1 h before sexual intercourse in random fashion. The ejaculatory latency was measured by stop watch and the satisfaction rate of both partner and patient was also recorded two times in the screening period and after the application of each test drugs. Clinical efficacy was considered if ejaculatory latency was prolonged more than 2 min and sexual satisfaction rate increased more than 20% than that of pretest values.", "The mean ejaculatory latencies were significantly prolonged after using various test drugs (placebo 2.27+/-0.32, SS-cream 0.05 g 4.47+/-0.81, 0.10 g 5.34+/-0.79, 0.15 g 6.22+/-0.87, 0.20 g 11.06+/-1.17 min, respectively). Clinical efficacies evaluated by ejaculatory latency were placebo 18%, SS-cream 0.05 g 30%, 0.10 g 60%, 0.15 g 54%, 0.20 g 84%, respectively. The satisfaction rate was also significantly increased dose-dependently (placebo 26%, SS-cream 0.05 g 60%, 0.10 g 70%, 0.15 g 78%, 0.20 g 90%, respectively). A side effect such as local mild burning sensation was noted in 35/250 times (14%) and no adverse effect on sexual function and no systemic side effects were observed. From the result of logistic regression analysis on clinical efficacy, the ED50 of SS-cream was obtained as 0.10 g. SS-cream 0.20 g was effective in 84% without any serious systemic side effects.", "From the above results, our conclusions are that SS-cream is effective on the treatment of PE with a few local side effects and that clinical optimal dose of SS-cream is 0.20 g."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."}], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "H K", "Initials": "HK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Xin", "ForeName": "Z C", "Initials": "ZC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "Y D", "Initials": "YD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "W H", "Initials": "WH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mah", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "D K", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Impot Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9007383", "ISSNLinking": "0955-9930"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Placebos"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Topical"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ejaculation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Logistic Models"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Placebos"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10553804", "10.1038/sj.ijir.3900431"]}}]}
