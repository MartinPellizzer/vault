The epigean parts were collected in June 2018 from the same region of Daran (Isfahan, Iran). The extraction of essential oil was carried out using a Clevenger apparatus. The composition of the essential oil was assayed by using a gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy apparatus (GC/MS).", "Results showed that the predominant compounds of essential oil of cultivated plants were \u03b1-pinene (13.66%), (E)-citral (12.89%), neral (11.25%), methyl geranate (8.66%), limonene (8.33%), campholenal (6.22%) and geraniol (5.69%), while those found in naturally grown plants were two main compounds: cyclohexylallene (52.63%) and limonene (35.88%). The antimicrobial properties of the plant were determined against 12 strains of microorganism by evaluating inhibition halo, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The highest inhibition halo for both oils from cultivated and wild plants was obtained against Aspergillus brasiliensis. The MIC value against Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis was 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, it was the lowest value provided by the essential oil obtained from the cultivated sample, the MIC was significantly lower than that obtained by treating the same strain with Rifampin. On the other hand, Candida albicans had the highest sensitivity (MIC value of 31.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for the essential oil obtained from wild plants as the inhibitory concentration was lower than that obtained treating the yeast with Nystatin.", "Therefore, according to the results of the present study, the use of the essential oil obtained from D. kotschyi can be used to protect food and to treat microbial infections."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
