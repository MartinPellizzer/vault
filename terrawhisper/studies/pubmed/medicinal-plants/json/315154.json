LATH stimulated only weakly the T-enriched and non-T fractions as compared to PHA which strongly stimulated the T-enriched population and weakly stimulated the non-T cells. Removal of phagocytic cells from the unfractionated lymphocytes caused only a slight reduction in the response to LATH. The responses of mixtures of T-enriched and non-T lymphocytes were similar to that of unfractionated lymphocytes. The LATH lectin seems, therefore, to be neither a pure T nor a pure non-T cell mitogen, since both populations must be present for optimal response. When alpha-methyl-D-mannoside was added to unfractionated lymphocytes together with LATH, there was a strong inhibition of thymidine incorporation. D-glucose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine diminished the stimulation effect to a lesser degree."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kolberg", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Michaelsen", "ForeName": "T E", "Initials": "TE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand C", "NlmUniqueID": "7508469", "ISSNLinking": "0304-1328"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monosaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Depletion"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Monosaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["315154"]}}]}
