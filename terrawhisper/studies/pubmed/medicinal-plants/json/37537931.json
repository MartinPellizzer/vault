Different types of harmful organism or pest exists in every agricultural crop. Synthetic pesticides are widely utilised around the world as a solution to this problem, but there are drawbacks associated with their application, the most significant of which are the severe negative impacts on ecosystems and human health. Organically made pesticides should be used instead of synthetic pesticides to reduce their harmful effects. Unlike chemical pesticides, natural pesticides do not cause any harm to non-target creatures and are inexpensive. Most botanical pesticides degrade rapidly, usually in only a few days but sometimes may even take hour. One of the most promising approaches to reducing pesticide pollution and protecting crops, food, and the environment is to use botanical insecticides. Beneficial insects such as earthworms are much less likely to be killed by biopesticides. The source of herbal insecticides is herbal plants. Each plant has distinct effect since every plant have their own chemical constituent. This review explains about numerous herbs and shrubs that feature distinct insecticidal, pesticidal and repelling effect. Insecticidal activity is discovered in a broad variety of herbal plants, and this review analyses those plants in detail, defining the major active ingredient responsible for these effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, India."}], "LastName": "Rajput", "ForeName": "Shivam", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, India."}], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "Pramod", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2874-6149"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Medical and Allied Sciences, Galgotias University, India."}], "LastName": "Malviya", "ForeName": "Rishabha", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Recent Adv Food Nutr Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "9918470777806676", "ISSNLinking": "2772-574X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insecticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Insect Repellents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insecticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ecosystem"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Insecta"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Crops, Agricultural"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Insect Repellents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "3", "Day": "29"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "4", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37537931", "10.2174/2772574X14666230804102104", "RAFNA-EPUB-133386"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
