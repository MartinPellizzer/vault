These uses include treating insomnia, central nervous system disorders, convulsions, nervous cough, and inflammation.", "This review aims to comprehensively summarize the ethnomedicinal uses, chemical constituents, pharmacology, and toxicology of E. velutina to explore its potential as a source for new therapeutic agents.", "Information was collected from scientific databases, dissertations, and books. Chemical structures were generated using ChemDraw. To ensure the accuracy of the plant names, \"World Flora Online\" (www.worldfloraonline.org) was consulted for the accepted names of plants.", "E. velutina is indigenous to Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Hispaniola. Approximately 244 compounds, mainly alkaloids and flavonoids, have been isolated from it. The plant and its extracts have exhibited various bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, analgesic, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects, validating some of its traditional medicinal uses. Erythrina velutina shows promising therapeutic potential for conditions like convulsion, central nervous disorders, anxiety, insomnia, and inflammation, primarily due to its alkaloid and flavonoid content.", "The traditional medicinal uses of the plant, combined with modern scientific research, underscore its pharmacological potential. This makes it a significant candidate for drug development. Further research should focus on conducting toxicological studies, clinical trials, and mechanistic investigations. These efforts will enable a comprehensive exploration of its pharmacological properties and potential applications in drug development."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
