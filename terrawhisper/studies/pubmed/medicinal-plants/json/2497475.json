Since we have previously shown that GR und PR have potent aldose reductase inhibitory activities, we further investigated the constituents of these two. The boiled water extract of GR was applied to Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and 6 fractions (Frs. A, B, Cs, Cp, D, and E) were obtained. Frs. Cp and D were retreated in the same manner and 7 pure compounds (GUs 1-7) were obtained. The boiled water extract of PR was fractionated with ethyl acetate followed by n-butanol and 3 fractions (Frs. 1-3) were collected. Fr. 1 was retreated in the same manner and 2 pure compounds (PRs 1 and 2) were obtained. Among the GU compounds, GU-2 was the most potent inhibitor of rat lens aldose reductase (RLAR) by inhibiting 86% at the concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml. The IC50 of GU-2 was 7.2 x 10(-7) M. Furthermore, GU-2 markedly inhibited sorbitol accumulation in human red blood cells, having an IC50 of 2.9 x 10(-5) M. GU-5 and PR-1 also inhibited RLAR (IC50: 5.6 x 10(-7) M and 6.3 x 10(-7) M, respectively). The structures of GU-2, GU-5, and PR-1 were identified as isoliquiritin, licuraside, and 1, 2, 3, 6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Aida", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tawata", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shindo", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Onaya", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sasaki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nishimura", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chin", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mitsuhashi", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "506T60A25R", "NameOfSubstance": "Sorbitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehyde Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehyde Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbitol"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2497475", "10.1055/s-2006-961768"]}}]}
