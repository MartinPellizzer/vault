An additional 65 plants not cited in old sources have been tested for anti-implantation activity. All are tabulated by systematic and local name, plant part used, activity reported in recent literature, estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity, and literature reference. 40 plants were found to have anti-implantation activity. 23 plants were tested in rodents for abortifacient activity, and all but 2 were active in 50% or more. Some of these have been extracted for the active alkaloid, and one extract, from Pueraria tuberosa, is being tested clinically. Many of the abortifacients were traditionally used either as coating of abortion sticks to be inserted in the cervix, or as gastrointestinal irritants. Those with toxic, neurotoxic, or estrogenic effects were eliminated for further tests. The fact that many plants were found to be active even though they were not mentioned in classic literature, suggests that all Indian plants should be tested at random for anti-implantation effects, under strict WHO guidelines."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["049571", "00183510"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Asia", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Contraceptive Agents, Postcoital", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postcoital", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "India", "Literature Review", "Medicine", "Menstrual Regulation", "Plants, Medicinal", "Southern Asia"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "2844661", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "11", "Day": "23"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "04", "Day": "18"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0971-5916", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "87", "PubDate": {"Year": "1988", "Month": "Apr"}}, "Title": "The Indian journal of medical research", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Med Res"}, "ArticleTitle": "A review of Indian medicinal plants with interceptive activity.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "336", "EndPage": "355", "MedlinePgn": "336-55"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kamboj", "ForeName": "V P", "Initials": "VP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Menstruation-Inducing Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Implantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Menstruation-Inducing Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "115"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2844661"]}}]}
