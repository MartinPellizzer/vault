The current therapeutic arsenal against the disease is associated with a series of chemotherapeutic setbacks. However, since the early 1990s, naturally occurring chalcones with promising antileishmanial effects have been reported, and several other synthetic chalcones and chalcone-hybrid molecules have been confirmed to possess potent activity against various Leishmania species. This paper is a comprehensive review covering the antileishmanial activity of 34 naturally occurring chalcones, 224 synthetic/semisynthetic chalcones and 54 chalcone-hybrid molecules. Several chalcones in the synthetic/semisynthetic category had IC<sub>50</sub> values\u2009<\u20095\u2009\u00b5M, with very good selectivity against parasites, and the structure-activity relationships as well as the proposed mechanism of action are discussed. We identified knowledge-gaps with the hope of providing future direction for the discovery of novel antileishmanial drugs from chalcones."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.
