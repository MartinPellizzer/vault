There is a 100-fold greater content of the photosynthetic enzyme, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, in light-grown seedlings of Pisum sativum than in dark-grown seedlings. Following the illumination of dark-grown seedlings, there is a parallel increase in the content of both the mRNA and the polypeptide of the small subunit of the carboxylase; this subunit is a product of the nuclear genome. The increases in the mRNA and the polypeptide of the large subunit, which is a product of the chloroplast genome, show less synchronicity. Studies with isolated leaf nuclei show that the increase in small subunit mRNA is mediated primarily at the level of transcription. Three distinct effects of light on transcription of small subunit genes have been found; a rapid (approximately 1 h) burst, followed by a decline, when etiolated plants are first exposed to light; a slow (approximately 36 h) development of the competence to transcribe rapidly after the initial burst; rapid (approximately 20 min) switches in both directions when fully greened plants are exposed to light-dark transitions."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ellis", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gallagher", "ForeName": "T F", "Initials": "TF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jenkins", "ForeName": "G I", "Initials": "GI"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Lennox", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Embryol Exp Morphol", "NlmUniqueID": "7906439", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0752"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.1.1.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6533238"]}}]}
