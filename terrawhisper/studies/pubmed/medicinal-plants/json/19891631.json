However, no extensive safety studies have been conducted on these extracts to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate toxicity of the aqueous extract of Turraeanthus africanus (Meliacaeae) after oral and intraperitoneal administration in mice. The acute toxicity was evaluated after single daily administration of the aqueous extract orally at doses of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 g kg(-1) or by the intraperitoneal route at doses of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 g kg(-1) of raw material. The subacute toxicity was evaluated only by the intraperitoneal route for 6 weeks at doses of 1.5, 3, 6 g kg(-1) of raw material. Oral doses up to 30 g kg(-1) of the aqueous extract of Turraeanthus africanus (TA) did not produce mortality or significant changes in the general behaviour and gross appearance of internal organs of rats. However, the intraperitoneal administration of the aqueous extract of Turraeanthus africanus caused dose-dependent lethal effects. The acute intraperitoneal toxicity (LD(50)) of TA extract in mice was 7.2 g kg(-1). In subacute toxicity in mice, after the intraperitoneal administration of TA extract for 6 consecutive weeks, the feed consumption was significantly affected at the dose 3 g kg(-1) with P < 0.05 and at the dose 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.001 and consequently had significant effect with P < 0.05 in body weight of animals. Level of triglyceride of treated animals lowered at dose 1.5 g kg(-1) with P < 0.001 and at dose 3 g kg(-1) and 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.05. Total cholesterol level of treated animals lowered at dose 1.5 g kg(-1) with P < 0.005 and at dose 3 and 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.001. HDL cholesterol level of treated animals lowered up to dose 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.05 while levels of LDL cholesterol, serum and tissue creatinine of treated animals lowered at dose 3 g kg(-1) and dose 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.05. Serum protein level of treated animal enhanced at dose 1.5 g kg(-1) and at dose 6 g kg(-1) with P < 0.05 while tissue creatinine level of treated animal enhanced with P < 0.001. The histology of liver, kidney and lung of the treated mice indicated morphological change of these organs (data not shown). No significant difference was observed during treatment concerning the haematological parameters. The results suggest that the plant is not toxic through the oral route in mice and that parenteral administration should be avoided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Science, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon. pmasso@yahoo.fr"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Massoma Lemb\u00e8", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sonfack", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gouado", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dimo", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dongmo", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Demasse", "ForeName": "M F A", "Initials": "MF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pankooui", "ForeName": "M J B", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jatsa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gonzales", "ForeName": "G F", "Initials": "GF"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Andrologia", "NlmUniqueID": "0423506", "ISSNLinking": "0303-4569"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triglycerides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "AYI8EX34EU", "NameOfSubstance": "Creatinine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Creatinine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Eating"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Meliaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Triglycerides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "11", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2010", "Month": "1", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19891631", "10.1111/j.1439-0272.2009.00934.x", "AND934"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
