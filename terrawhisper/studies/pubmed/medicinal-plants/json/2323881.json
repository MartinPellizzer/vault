(1988) J. Agric. Food Chem. 36, 896-902]. These differences in their proteolytic behavior were studied in relation to their solution conformational states. The secondary structures of these three proteins determined by far u.v. circular dichroism were characterized by predominantly beta-sheet and beta-turn parameters. However, characterization of tertiary and quaternary structures using second derivative u.v. absorption spectroscopy, surface hydrophobicity using cis-parinaric acid as hydrophobic probe, and fluorescence quenching studies of intrinsic Trp fluorescence using an ionic (iodide) and a neutral (acrylamide) quencher indicated sharp differences in the conformation of these proteins. About 9.6 and 10.2 out of 13 and 15 tyrosyls/subunit of phaseolin and beta-conglycinin, respectively, were exposed to polar solvent, while the surface hydrophobicity varied beta-conglycinin greater than vicilin greater than phaseolin. The Trp residues in phaseolin were not accessible to iodide, while half those of vicilin and beta-conglycinin were quenched. The order of Trp accessibility to acrylamide was vicilin greater than beta-conglycinin greater than phaseolin. The relative compactness of these three proteins based on these studies was related to the observed differences in their susceptibility to various proteinases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison."}], "LastName": "Deshpande", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Damodaran", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Int J Pept Protein Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0330420", "ISSNLinking": "0367-8377"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antigens, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Globulins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Seed Storage Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soybean Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-conglycinin protein, Glycine max"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104042-75-3", "NameOfSubstance": "phaseolin protein, Phaseolus vulgaris"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9067-60-1", "NameOfSubstance": "vicilin protein, plant"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antigens, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Circular Dichroism"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Globulins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins, Dietary"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seed Storage Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soybean Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Fluorescence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2323881", "10.1111/j.1399-3011.1990.tb00717.x"]}}]}
