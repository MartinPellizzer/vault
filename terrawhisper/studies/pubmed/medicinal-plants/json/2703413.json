{"PubmedBookArticle": [], "PubmedArticle": [{"MedlineCitation": {"OtherAbstract": [{"AbstractText": ["Now that the training of midwives has begun to include international studies, midwives should seek to develop more knowledge and understanding of cultural differences. Midwives will discover that there is much that unites them over the whole world. It is only in recent years that the medical aspects of childbirth have taken precedence over the central role of the mother and child in the family. The folk practices of many lands reflect a common heritage. In Holland, for example, it was customary to give dragees of anise seed to new mothers to stimulate milk production. Fennel was used in the same way in certain African countries. A great deal of material on the subject is available not only in the memories of the older generation but also in specialized museums and libraries in many countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has done much to gather study materials. Comparative studies of childbirth practices can shed light on important factors in the care of mothers and babies. In sweden, cultures that were once distant from us have grown nearer through our immigrants, increasing our need to understand the background of childbirth in these cultures. Our immigrant colleagues can give us interesting glimpses via discussions and presentations. We should look to our own country, to Scandinavia, to Europe and to all continents and strive to gain a sense of unity which often has become lost. The efforts of midwives to become more internationalized will then be marked by understanding and the exchange of experience. Midwives in all countries are good at that."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["060499", "00193093"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: JORDEMODERN."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Breast Feeding", "Cultural Background", "Curriculum", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developed Countries", "Education", "Europe", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Infant Nutrition", "Medicine", "Midwives", "Northern Europe", "Nutrition", "Philosophical Overview", "Plants, Medicinal", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Scandinavia", "Sweden", "Training Activities", "Training Programs"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "2703413", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "05", "Day": "23"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17"}, "Article": {"Language": ["swe"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0021-7468", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "102", "Issue": "3", "PubDate": {"Year": "1989", "Month": "Mar"}}, "Title": "Jordemodern", "ISOAbbreviation": "Jordemodern"}, "ArticleTitle": "[Observations on internationalization].", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "88", "EndPage": "90", "MedlinePgn": "88-90"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Negussie", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Reflexioner om internationalisering."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Sweden", "MedlineTA": "Jordemodern", "NlmUniqueID": "17810330R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-7468"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Africa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Culture"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Europe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "International Cooperation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maternal Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Midwifery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2703413"]}}]}
