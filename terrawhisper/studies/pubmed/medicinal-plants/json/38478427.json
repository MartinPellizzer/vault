Plants have several 4CLs showing divergence in sequence: Class I 4CLs involved in lignin metabolism, Class II 4CLs associated with flavonoid metabolism, and atypical 4CLs and 4CL-like proteins of unknown function. Shikonin, a Boraginaceae-specific specialized metabolite in red gromwell (Lithospermum erythrorhizon), is biosynthesized from p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and the involvement of 4CL in its biosynthesis has long been debated. In this study, we demonstrated the requirement of 4CL for shikonin biosynthesis using a 4CL-specific inhibitor. In silico analysis of the L. erythrorhizon genome revealed the presence of at least 8 4CL genes, among which the expression of 3 (Le4CL3, Le4CL4, and Le4CL5) showed a positive association with shikonin production. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Le4CL5 belongs to Class I 4CLs, while Le4CL3 and Le4CL4 belong to clades that are distant from Class I and Class II. Interestingly, both Le4CL3 and Le4CL4 have peroxisome targeting signal 1 in their C-terminal region, and subcellular localization analysis revealed that both localize to the peroxisome. We targeted each of the 3 Le4CL genes by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and observed remarkably lower shikonin production in Le4CL3-ge and Le4CL4-ge genome-edited lines compared with the vector control. We, therefore, conclude that peroxisomal Le4CL3 and Le4CL4 are responsible for shikonin production and propose a model for metabolite-specific 4CL distribution in L. erythrorhizon."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.
