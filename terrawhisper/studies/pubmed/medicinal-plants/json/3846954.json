In the early days of production of oral contraceptives (OCs), most yams were gathered from the wild in Mexico. The type richest in steroids takes 3 years to mature and its cultivation has become something of an art. Yams grow best in light, well-drained soil, and for this reason are grown in mounds which have been heavily manured. Propagation is by planting the tops or heads or by small portions of the tuber which is a swollen shoot. Other varieties are planted before the onset of the rains and the crop harvested about 8 months later. In 1970 the Mexican government nationalized the yam industry as a safeguard. This pushed up prices and the drug companies looked elsewhere for a cheap source. Although Mexico still remains the principal grower, India, South Africa, and the Far East supply the industry with plant origin steroids. As more than 90% of the hefty yam tubers consist of water, well over 100,000 tons have to be harvested every year to provide the 600-700 tons of the saponin diosgenin used by the drug companies. In China, where Western corticosteroids are regarded as too expensive for the barefoot doctors, several species of yam are used. Research has been going on to find another source of diosgenin and the most promising seems to be fenugreek, Trigonella foenumgraecum. \"Foenum graecum\" is Latin for Greek hay and was used by the early Greeks as a culinary and medicinal herb throughout the Mediterranean area. The richness of fenugreek was used to improve the roundness of women's breasts and to stimulate the flow of milk. Bath University has spent 10 years researching the development of a species of fenugreek which will yield large amounts of diosgenin. A certain amount of steroids come from animal sources. Such steroids are given when there is an adverse reaction from the administeration of the synthetic variety. Placentae are a rich source of steroids and have been found to contain hormones, minerals, and enzymes. Placentae now are becoming big business throughout Europe. Although it is possible to make OCs from placental extract, it is not commercially viable. Over 600 varieties of yam exist and at this time there is no danger of the supply running out."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["034140", "00155797"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: NURSING TIMES."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Biology", "Contraception", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Contraceptive Methods", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Economic Factors", "Endocrine System", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Hormones", "Medicine", "Oral Contraceptives", "Physiology", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproductive Control Agents", "Research And Development", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "3846954", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "07", "Day": "09"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2013", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0954-7762", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "81", "Issue": "18", "PubDate": {"MedlineDate": "1985 May 1-7"}}, "Title": "Nursing times", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nurs Times"}, "ArticleTitle": "The day of the yam.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "47", "MedlinePgn": "47"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rosser", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nurs Times", "NlmUniqueID": "0423236", "ISSNLinking": "0954-7762"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Oral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K49P2K8WLX", "NameOfSubstance": "Diosgenin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Diosgenin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3846954"]}}]}
