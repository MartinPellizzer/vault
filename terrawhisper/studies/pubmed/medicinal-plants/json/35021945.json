The synthesized derivatives were assessed for anticancer activity against five different cancer cell lines using the <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> MTT assay and the results showed that most of the derivatives are potent against cancer cells comparing with the control. Compounds <b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b> showed excellent activity against all the cancer cells with less than 12.5\u2009\u00b5M and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase in both CAL27 and SCC9 cells. Compound <b>5e</b> induces the early apoptosis in CAL27 cells and compounds <b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b> induce early and late apoptosis, respectively, in SCC9 cells. Moreover, compounds <b>5b</b>, <b>5c</b>, <b>5i</b>, and <b>5j</b> showed excellent anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by inhibiting IL-6 production. The molecular docking studies revealed that compound <b>5e</b> has strong interaction with the CLK kinase and protein kinase II through hydrogen binding Asp325 and Lys290."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Natural Products & Traditional Knowledge, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Dileep Kumar", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Natural Products & Traditional Knowledge, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Siva", "ForeName": "Bandi", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Natural Products & Traditional Knowledge, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Ashwini", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Vinod Kumar", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Natural Products & Traditional Knowledge, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Ramalingam", "ForeName": "V", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Applied Biology, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}], "LastName": "Sai Balaji", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Centre for Natural Products & Traditional Knowledge, CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Suresh Babu", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "KA46RNI6HN", "NameOfSubstance": "Emodin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "C8IYT9CR7C", "NameOfSubstance": "aloe emodin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthraquinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Emodin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aloe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anthraquinones"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "4", "Day": "17", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "36"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35021945", "10.1080/14786419.2021.2024531"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
