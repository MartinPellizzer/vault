The present study aims at extraction, isolation of the plant secondary metabolite eugenol (<b>1</b>), it's derivatisation and structure identification as bioactive molecules. Synthesis and antiplasmodial activity (<i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i>), of a series of fourteen novel eugenol-based 1,2,3-triazole derivatives was done in the present study. Derivatives <b>5a</b>-<b>5n</b> showed good antimalarial activity against the strain <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> NF<sub>54</sub>. Derivative <b>5\u2009m</b>, IC<sub>50</sub> at 2.85\u2009\u00b5M was found to be several times better than its precursor <b>1</b> (106.82\u2009\u00b5M) whereas the derivative <b>5n</b> showed three fold better activity than compound <b>1</b>, <i>in vitro</i>. The structure-activity relationship of the synthesised compounds indicated that the presence of triazole ring in eugenol analogues is responsible for their good activity. Compound <b>5m</b>, was further evaluated for <i>in-vivo</i> antimalarial activity which showed about 79% parasitemia suppression. It is the first report on antimalarial activity of triazole eugenol derivatives."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Jyoti"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Prospection and Product Development, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Bhatt", "ForeName": "Divya", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Prospection and Product Development, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Saurabh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Maurya", "ForeName": "Aransha", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2688-7714"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Prospection and Product Development, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Pal", "ForeName": "Anirban", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Prospection and Product Development, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Darokar", "ForeName": "Mahendra P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Bio-Prospection and Product Development, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}], "LastName": "Bawankule", "ForeName": "Dnyaneshwar U", "Initials": "DU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Division, CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), Ghaziabad, India."}], "LastName": "Tandon", "ForeName": "Sudeep", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "44"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38828834", "10.1080/14786419.2024.2348670"]}}]}
