These outcomes may ultimately lead to maternal and child mortality or morbidity. Few studies have been done to measure the effects of various herbs in pregnant women or a developing fetus. This study investigated the effects of the commonly used labour inducing plant, <i>Cissampelos mucronata</i>, on pregnancy outcomes using a rat model.", "Pregnant female rats were divided into 3 groups of 10 each. The first group was the control. The second group was treated with the aqueous extract of <i>Cissampelos mucronata</i> at mid-pregnancy. The third group was treated with <i>Cissampelos mucronata</i> close to full term. All the groups were left to give birth and outcomes were recorded.", "Rats treated at mid-term had significantly low number of pups when compared to the control group as well as the close to term treated group (4.1 \u00b1 0.54 vs. 6.4 \u00b1 0.60; 6.2\u00b1 0.56). The mid-term treated rats had pups with significantly lower body weight when compared to the control and the close to term treated groups (3.73 \u00b1 0.36g vs. 5.37 \u00b1 0.16g; 4.27 \u00b1 0.1g). The average gestation period was significantly short in the mid-term treated group when compared to the control and the close to term treated groups (18.16 \u00b1 0.50 days vs. 20.40 \u00b1 0.44 days; 20.12 \u00b1 0.37 days).
