The first promising organism found was the novel fungus, Taxomyces andreanae, which was isolated from the inner bark of a yew tree growing in northwestern Montana. It appears to produce taxol and other taxanes in de novo fashion when grown in semi-synthetic liquid media. The presence of 1 in the fungal extract was confirmed by mass spectrometry, comparative chromatographic behavior with \"yew\" taxol, reactivity with taxol-specific monoclonal antibodies, and 9KB cytotoxicity studies. Both acetate-1-14C and phenylalanine UL-14C served as precursors of taxol-14C in fungal culture labeling studies, confirming the de novo synthesis of 1 by the fungus. Immunoassay techniques are currently being used to screen extracts of Taxomyces andreanae for new taxanes, and to determine if other endophytic fungi are taxol producers."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Pathology, Montana State University, Bozeman 59717, USA."}], "LastName": "Stierle", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Strobel", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stierle", "ForeName": "D", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grothaus", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bignami", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nat Prod", "NlmUniqueID": "7906882", "ISSNLinking": "0163-3864"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "biosynthesis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7494141", "10.1021/np50123a002"]}}]}
