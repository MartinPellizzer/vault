The bile duct-ligated animals received quercetin at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 10 days, followed by biochemical tests, oxidative stress markers, activity of antioxidant enzymes and hematoxylin and eosin staining. Molecular docking was used to explore the interactive behavior of quercetin with glutathione peroxidase.", "According to analyses of the obtained extract, two main active ingredients of P. hyoscyamoides were rutin and quercetin. Bile duct-ligated group showed a significant liver necrosis, a clear increase in plasma and tissue oxidative stress parameters, and a decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity as compared to sham control group. Quercetin injection in bile duct-ligated rats resulted in significant decrease in hydroxyproline, protein carbonyl and histopathologic indexes and significant increase in glutathione peroxidase activity (P-value\u22640.05). Based on the molecular docking, the quercetin was able to regulate the glutathione peroxidase activity.", "The quercetin acts as an enzyme inducer by renewing the glutathione peroxidase activity and inhibiting the oxidation of proteins and hence decreases the oxidative stress. These results could be a sign of confirming the positive role of quercetin in attenuating the liver damage and degeneration."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran"}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran"}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran, P.O.
