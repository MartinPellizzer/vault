Secondary metabolites composition and antioxidant capacities of C. pilosula root collected successively from four seasons were determined. The chemical properties, nutrient content and enzyme activities of rhizosphere of C. pilosula were significantly different under different temporal and spatial conditions. All soil samples were alkaline (pH 7.64-8.42), with water content ranging from 9.53% to 19.95%, and electrical conductivity varied widely, showing obvious time-scale effects. Different time scales were the main reasons for the diversity and structure of rhizosphere bacterial community of C. pilosula. The diversity and richness of rhizosphere bacterial community in autumn and winter were higher than those in spring and summer, and bacterial community structure in spring and summer was more similar to that in autumn and winter. The root length and diameter of C. pilosula showed significant time gradient difference under different spatiotemporal conditions. Nutrition and niche competition lead to significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions between rhizosphere bacteria and endophytic bacteria, which invisibly affect soil properties, abundance of functional bacteria and even yield and quality of C. pilosula. Soil properties, rhizosphere bacteria and endophytic bacteria directly promoted root phenotype, stress resistance and polysaccharide accumulation of C. pilosula."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
