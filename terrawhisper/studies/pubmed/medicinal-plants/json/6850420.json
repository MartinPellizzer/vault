Cells were grown at 37 degrees C and in the same medium containing 1 M NaCl at 46 degrees C, a temperature at which this organism can grow only when protected by NaCl. Cells of these cultures are hereafter called 37 degrees C-cells and 46 degrees C-cells, respectively. The 37 degrees C-cells harvested when the pH was 7.1 to 7.7 had decimal reduction times (D60-value) of 1.8 to 3.1 min in 50 mM pH 7.2 Tris buffer. The D60 value of 46 degrees C-cells tested in the same way, harvested from cultures at pH 6.6 to 7.6, ranged from 5.3 to a maximum of 12.8 min. In milk, green beans, peas, or beef slurry, the D60-value of 46 degrees C-cells was about four times higher than that of 37 degrees C-cells. Length of survival after freeze-drying in skim-milk powder exposed to air was longest for the cells with the highest D-value. In freeze-dried peas and media acidified with acetic and lactic acids, 46 degrees C-cells survived longer than 37 degrees C-cells. However, the sensitivity of the two kinds of cells to potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and sodium propionate was essentially the same, but the 46 degrees C-cells were more resistant to butylated hydroxyanisole and sodium nitrite."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "El-Banna", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hurst", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Food Preservatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "33X04XA5AT", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Microbiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freeze Drying"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Meat"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6850420", "10.1139/m83-049"]}}]}
