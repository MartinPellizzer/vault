Most of the ginsenosides (1-100 microM) had a tendency to reduce the ACh-evoked secretion of catecholamines. The order of inhibitory potency (at the concentration of 10 microM) was as follows: Rg2 > Rf > Re > Rh1 > Rb2, Rg1 > Rb1 > Rc > Rb3, Rd, Ro, Rs1. The inhibition of ginseoside Rg2 at 10 microM was 72%, but ginsenosides Rb3, Rd, Ro and Rs1 did not show the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, ginsenoside Rg2 (1-100 microM) did not at all affect the secretion induced by high K+ or veratridine, a potent specific activator of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels. Ginsenoside Rg2 (1-100 microM) also inhibited both ACh-induced Na+ and Ca++ influxes into the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The concentration-response curves for ginsenoside Rg2 inhibition of Na+ influx, of Ca++ influx and of catecholamine secretion were quite similar. The inhibitory effect of ginsenoside Rg2 on the secretion was not overcome by increasing ACh or external Ca++ concentrations. These results strongly suggest that the ginseng saponins, especially ginsenoside Rg2, block the nicotinic ACh receptors or the receptor-operated Na+ channels (but not voltage-sensitive Na+ and Ca++ channels), inhibit Na+ influx through the channels and consequently reduce both Ca++ influx and catecholamine secretion in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan."}], "LastName": "Tachikawa", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kudo", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kashimoto", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Takahashi", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catecholamines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "71-62-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Veratridine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NEZ333N27", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "N9YNS0M02X", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "RWP5GA015D", "NameOfSubstance": "Potassium"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenal Glands"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Catecholamines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromaffin Granules"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ion Transport"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Potassium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Veratridine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "5", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7752064"]}}]}
