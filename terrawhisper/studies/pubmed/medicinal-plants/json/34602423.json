Skin cancer was induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) in young Balb/c mice. Plant extracts were administered to animals orally, once/day (100mg/kg, 5 days/week) for the 20 weeks. Anticancer activity was examined via tumor progression, where antimutagenic activity was measured using 8-OHdG and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) levels. Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. leaves extract and Silybum marianum L. leaves extract significantly reduced 8-OHdG in cultured human lymphocytes in a dose-response manner (P<0.05). Similarly, the leave extracts of both plants significantly reduced chromosomal damage as measured by SCE levels (P<0.05). In the skin painting assay, the leave extracts of both plants significantly delayed the onset of tumors compared to DMBA treated group (P<0.05). The Silybum marianum leaves extract significantly reduced tumor incidence (P<0.01) and papilloma frequency (P<0.01) induced by DMBA. The Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaves extract significantly reduced the number of tumors per animal (P<0.05) and incidence of tumors (P<0.001). The in vitro and in vivo findings showed that leaves of Silybum marianum L. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. extracts might be a promising source for anticancer and antimutagenic agents against human cancer."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "H Alzoubi", "ForeName": "Karem", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "F Khabour", "ForeName": "Omar", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "S Alkofahi", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "M Mhaidat", "ForeName": "Nizar", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Laboratories, Faculty of Health Sciences, American University of Madaba, Madaba, Jordan/Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "A Abu-Siniyeh", "ForeName": "Ahmed", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Carcinogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "57-97-6", "NameOfSubstance": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "88847-89-6", "NameOfSubstance": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Carcinoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Silybum marianum"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "genetics", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Skin Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Burden"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "4", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "10", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34602423"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
