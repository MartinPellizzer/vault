Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to search for any endotherms arising from lipid state changes in chloroplast lamellar membranes of the chilling-sensitive plants cantaloupe , kidney bean, domestic tomato, and soybean. For comparison, calorimetric scans of chloroplast lamellar membranes from the chilling-insensitive plants spinach, pea, and wild tomato were made. A large reversible endotherm, extending from below 10 degrees to nearly 40 degrees C, was observed in chloroplast membranes from tomatoes of both chilling-sensitive (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Floramerica ) and chilling-insensitive (L. hirsutum LA 1361) species. A much smaller endotherm, approximately 5 to 10% of the area of that seen in the two tomato species, and extending over a similar temperature range, was detected in chloroplasts from chilling-insensitive spinach and peas, and also was generally observed in chloroplasts from chilling-sensitive cantaloupe , kidney bean, and soybean. The enthalpy of these smaller endotherms indicates that, if the endotherm arose entirely from a lipid transition, then it corresponded to the melting of less than about 10% of the total membrane polar lipid. On the basis of these data it is concluded that there is no correlation between chilling sensitivity of photosynthesis and the presence or absence of a phase transition of bulk membrane lipids of the chloroplast lamellar membrane at temperatures above 5 degrees C."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Low", "ForeName": "P S", "Initials": "PS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ort", "ForeName": "D R", "Initials": "DR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Cramer", "ForeName": "W A", "Initials": "WA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Whitmarsh", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Martin", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Membrane Lipids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cold Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Membrane Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidation-Reduction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Photosynthesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thermodynamics"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1984", "Month": "6", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1984", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["6732236", "10.1016/0003-9861(84)90396-5", "0003-9861(84)90396-5"]}}]}
