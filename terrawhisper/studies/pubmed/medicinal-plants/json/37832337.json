These biocatalysts can significantly accelerate organic chemical processes and improve product stereospecificity. The unique characteristics of biocatalyst helpful in synthesizing the environmentally friendly flavour and aroma compounds used as a food additive in foodstuffs. With methods like enzyme engineering on biotechnological interventions the efficient tuning of produce will fulfil the needs of food industry. This review summarizes the biosynthesis of different flavour and aroma component through microbial catalysts and using advanced techniques which are available for enzyme improvement. Also pointing out their benefits and drawbacks for specific technological processes necessary for successful industrial application of biocatalysts. The article covers the market scenario, cost economics, environmental safety and regulatory framework for the production of food flavoured chemicals by the bioprocess engineering."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
