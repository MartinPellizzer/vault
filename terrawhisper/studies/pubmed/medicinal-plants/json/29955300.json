The purpose of this study was to explore the measures that have been employed by the Tonga people of southern Zambia to sustain their local biophysical environment. The research focussed on investigating the strategies which they use to conserve the soil, water, animals, medicinal and fruit plants, and rangeland. A qualitative research design was used in the study. The data were collected through interviews with elderly Tonga people and herbalists, and through observation and personal participation in the daily life of the Tongas. The study reveals that selective harvesting, totemism and taboos, organic farming, crop rotation and intercropping, sacredness of water sources and traditional authority are the main instruments of environmental conservation amongst the Tonga. The article concludes that governments, policymakers and environmentalists need to give the conservation strategies employed by indigenous people the prominence they deserve for environmental sustainability."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Languages and Social Sciences Education, University of Botswana, Botswana."}], "LastName": "Kanene", "ForeName": "Kennedy M", "Initials": "KM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "South Africa", "MedlineTA": "Jamba", "NlmUniqueID": "101606753", "ISSNLinking": "1996-1421"}, "CoiStatement": "The author declares that he has no financial or personal relationships which may have inappropriately influenced him in writing this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Anup S, 2005, \u2018Poverty and the environment\u2019, Global Issues, 12 February, viewed 22 August 2016, from http://www.globalissues.org/article/425/poverty-and-the-environment"}, {"Citation": "Aregheore E.A, 2010, Zambia Country Pasture/Forage Resource Profiles, Marfel Consulting, Burnaby."}, {"Citation": "Ayong F.M, 2007, \u2018Environmental awareness and management in Pre-Colonial Zimbabwe\u2019, Journal of Geographic Research 2(1), 98\u2013111."}, {"Citation": "Berkwits M. & Inui S.T, 1998, \u2018Making use of qualitative research techniques\u2019, Journal of General Internal Medicine\n13(3), 195\u2013199. http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-1497.1998.00054.x", "ArticleIdList": ["10.1046/j.1525-1497.1998.00054.x", "PMC1496926", "9541377"]}, {"Citation": "Central Statistical Office Zambia , 2010, Zambia- 2010 Census of population and housing, CSO, Lusaka."}, {"Citation": "Central Statistical Office Zambia , 2016, Zambia: Provincial Administrative Division, viewed 02 August 2016 from http://www.citypopulation.de/Zambia-Cities.htmlweb"}, {"Citation": "Chapungu M.R, 2000, Environmental biology, University of Cambridge, New York."}, {"Citation": "Chikwanha V.T, 2011, \u2018The role of indigenous knowledge in management of forest resources in Mugabe Area, Masvingo.
