Pig farmers are key stakeholders supporting Thailand's national strategic plan on AMR which aims to reduce antimicrobial consumption in the livestock sector. Consequently, this study explored the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of pig farmers towards AMU and AMR, expecting to provide information that would help guide policymakers in the development of a proper interventional program for antimicrobial stewardship. The qualitative approach utilized individual, face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the 20 owners of middle- and large-scale pig farms in eastern Thailand. The major themes identified in this finding were: (1) the use of antimicrobials on farms and the knowledge of antimicrobials; (2) AMU on pig farms (the purpose of AMU, antimicrobial prescription practices, and performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing); (3) attitudes towards prescribing practices and record keeping; (4) farm animal husbandry practices and AMU; (5) factors influencing AMU; and (6) awareness regarding AMR. Most of the pig farm owners recognized that achieving Good Agricultural Practices certification required following the legislation and regulations for AMU. Other observations were that the respondents had positive attitudes towards prescribing practices, performing antimicrobial susceptibility testing before antimicrobial therapy, and recording drug use on farms; however, there was low awareness of AMR. In addition, alternative substances, such as medicinal plants, and proper biosecurity practices were mentioned. Factors influencing AMU on pig farms were intensive enforcement of legislation and regulations, the implementation of farm management practices, the provision of information and consultancy services by veterinary professionals, farmer experience, and consumer trends."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
