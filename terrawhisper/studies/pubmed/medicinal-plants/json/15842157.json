The times of experiment are reduced and the data obtained can be treated with computer. Uniform design is a potent tool in seeking for the optimal experimental condition or the optimal proportion of experiments. So, it is often used to study extraction and preparation form technology of TCM. In recent years, the uniform design has been used in the domain of traditional Chinese recipe and the compatibility of its component drugs. The study showed that the analytical results of TCM theory and that of uniform design are extremely consistent. As an optimal screening means in modernizing study on Chinese herbs, using uniform design in studying classical recipe, the \"syndrome\" corresponding recipe whereas it is helpful to deeply recognize the scientific connotation of \"recipe syndrome\"."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing. maluzx2003@yahoo.com.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Lu", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jian-gang", "Initials": "JG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shi", "ForeName": "Da-zhuo", "Initials": "DZ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "9211576", "ISSNLinking": "1003-5370"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Prescriptions"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards", "trends"], "DescriptorName": "Research Design"}], "NumberOfReferences": "35"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15842157"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
