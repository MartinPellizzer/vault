The present study aims to investigate application of complementary and traditional medicines among diabetic patients in Iran in 2016. This was a cross-sectional study done on 294 diabetic patients who were referred to the diabetes clinic and were chosen using convenient sampling. Data were gathered using a demographic characteristics form and a researcher-made questionnaire (for studying application and satisfaction of using some of the complementary and alternative medicines). A total of 88.4% of diabetic patients have used at least one complementary and alternative treatment in the past year. The most common treatment was medicinal plants, which were used by 84.9% of the participants. Sixty-nine percent of the patients were satisfied with using complementary and traditional treatments. This study showed that diabetic patients are very interested in using complementary and alternative medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "1 School of Nursing and Midwifery, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sheikhrabori", "ForeName": "Akbar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "2 Nursing Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Dehghan", "ForeName": "Mahlagha", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "3 School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaedi", "ForeName": "Fateme", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "4 Department of Prehospital Emergency, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khademi", "ForeName": "Gholam Reza", "Initials": "GR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Complementary Therapies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Patient Satisfaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}], "CoiStatement": "<b>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</b> The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Snyder M, Lindquist R.
