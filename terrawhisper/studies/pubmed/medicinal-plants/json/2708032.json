Both activities were completely destroyed by pretreatment of V. album extracts with pectinase, hemicellulase, amyloglucosidase and alpha-glucosidase, but not with proteases and RNase, i.e., the activities are linked to a polysaccharide. The active component in V. album extract was non-dialysable at a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000. Inhibition of both activities was observed with D-galacturonic acid, poly-galacturonic acid and pectins. The site of galacturonic acid-specific interaction could be identified on the effector cells. The rate of effector cell/tumor cell conjugate formation in the presence of V. album extracts, as well as the abrogation of both activities by pretreatment of V. album extracts with exoglycosidases specific for sugars other than galacturonic acid indicated an action of the NK cytotoxicity-enhancing component on the basis of a bridging mechanism. However, no conclusive results could be obtained for the structural specificity of the site interacting with the target cells."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Friedrich-Miescher-Laboratorium, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, T\u00fcbingen, F.R.G."}], "LastName": "Mueller", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hamprecht", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Anderer", "ForeName": "F A", "Initials": "FA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "7902474", "ISSNLinking": "0162-3109"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Killer Cells, Natural"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "immunology", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2708032", "10.1016/0162-3109(89)90003-9", "0162-3109(89)90003-9"]}}]}
