The chemical structures of the compounds were identified by their physicochemical properties, spectroscopic data, and literature. They were 4-hydroxyphenethyl ethyl succinate(1), 4-hydroxyphenethyl methyl succinate(2), 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl acetate(3), p-hydroxyphenylethyl anisate(4), cassia cis-trans diphenylpropanoid(5), p-coumaric acid(6), 3,4-dihydroxybenzenepropionic acid methyl ester(7), caffeic acid(8), trans-p-hydroxyl ethyl cinnamate(9), methyl p-hydroxybenzeneacetate(10), 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol(11), syringic acid(12), vanillin(13), protocatechuic acid(14), salicylic acid(15), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde(16), and diorcinol(17). Among them, compound 1 was new, and compounds 2-10, 12, 14, and 16-17 were isolated from the plants belonging to Leucas genus for the first time. All compounds were obtained from L. ciliata for the first time. The anti-inflammatory activity of compounds 1-17 on NO production in lipopolysaccharide(LPS)-induced mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage(RAW264. 7) cells was evaluated. The results showed that compounds 5, 7, and 9 exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity, with IC50values of(10. 14\u00b10. 36)-(21. 17\u00b10. 11) \u03bcmol\u00b7L~(-1)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Kuang", "ForeName": "Jia-Cai", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Zhang-Xin", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Cen", "ForeName": "Fu-Ling", "Initials": "FL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Bao", "Initials": "XB"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Ting", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Resource Chemistry of Ministry of Education, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China Key Laboratory of Tropical Medicinal Plant Chemistry of Hainan Province, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hainan Normal University Haikou 571158, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Guang-Ying", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "I3P9R8317T", "NameOfSubstance": "phenolic acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Hydroxybenzoates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RAW 264.7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lamiaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["39041153", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240218.201"]}}]}
