Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) protein fingerprinting and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing of Illumina Miseq were used to analyze the heat resistant microbial community of 9 varieties of Chinese herbal pieces. Stem pieces (Spatholobi Caulis, Tetrapanacis Medulla, Stachyuri Medulla) showed highest detection rate and most species of contaminants; However fruit pieces (Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus) had the lowest detection rate and least species of contaminants; among root pieces, the detection rate and number of contaminants species were lower in Tuber Dioscoreae Persimilis and Rehmanniae Radix Praeparata. The heat resistant microbial community was mainly of Bacillaceae and Paenibacillaceae, and Bacillus showed the highest detection rate among them, followed by Brevibacillus, Paenibacillus, and Solibacillus. The rest genus in high-throughput sequencing analysis included Enterobacter, Brevundimonas, Leuconostoc, Methylobacterium, Dechloromonas, Pantoea, Klebsiella, and Erwinia. There were potential risk factors in heat resistant microbial community of Chinese herbal pieces, so we shall improve the microbial limit standard, strictly control the pathogenic bacteria in the product, and strengthen the supervision and management in production and circulation of Chinese herbal pieces."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Gan", "ForeName": "Yong-Qi", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Nong", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Fan", "ForeName": "Lan-Yan", "Initials": "LY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Ling", "ForeName": "Wen-Chao", "Initials": "WC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Zhu", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Guangxi Institute for Food and Drug Control, Nanning 530021, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["classification", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Bacteria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Contamination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hot Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbiota"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29945379"]}}]}
