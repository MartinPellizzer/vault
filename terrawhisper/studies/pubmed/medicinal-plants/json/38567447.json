On the other hand, crocin (one of the main compounds of Crocus sativus L. or Saffron) may be beneficial in the improvement of mental and cognitive dysfunctions. Also, crocin can restore the deleterious effects of SD on mental and cognitive processes. In this study, we investigated the effect of REM SD on female rats' behaviors including depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, locomotion, pain perception, and obsessive-compulsive-like behavior, and also, the potential effect of crocin on REM SD effects. We used female rats because evidence on the role of REM SD in modulating psychological and behavioral functions of female (but not male) rats is limited. REM SD was induced for 14 days (6h/day), and crocin (25, 50, and 75\u2005mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally. Open field test, forced swim test, hot plate test, and marble burying test were used to assess rats' behaviors. The results showed REM SD-induced manic-like behavior (hyperlocomotion). Also, REM SD rats showed decreased anxiety- and depression-like behavior, pain subthreshold (the duration it takes for the rat to feel pain), and showed obsessive compulsive-like behavior. However, crocin at all doses partially or fully reversed REM SD-induced behavioral changes. In conclusion, our results suggested the possible comorbidity of OCD and REM SD-induced manic-like behavior in female rats or the potential role of REM SD in the etiology of OCD, although more studies are needed. In contrast, crocin can be a possible therapeutic choice for decreasing manic-like behaviors."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.
