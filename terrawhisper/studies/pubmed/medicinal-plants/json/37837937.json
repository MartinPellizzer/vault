The intensity of these changes depended on the species of fungus and the number of exposures of the mycelia to the DBD plasma. Microscopic observations showed that the plasma damaged the surface of the hyphae, increased their thickness and decreased overall dry biomass of the organisms. A decrease in pectinolytic activity was found in F. oxysporum and A. alternata, in contrast to B. cinerea, where an increase in pectinolytic activity was observed after the fifth plasma treatment. Changes in specific xylanase activity varied and were dependent on the species of fungus. The percentage of cucumber seeds germinated artificially infected with mycelium after multiple plasma treatments increased compared to those that were mycelium infected prior to plasma exposure. Plants that developed from seeds after plasma exposure were characterized by a higher biomass and longer roots and stems. Multiple treatments of the studied fungi with plasma, followed by seed infection, increased the SWVI and SWVI indexes of cucumber seedlings, but they did not reach the characteristic value of the control seeds (not infected with fungi). The reduced phytopathogenicity of the tested fungi was confirmed by artificial infestation of tomato fruits."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
