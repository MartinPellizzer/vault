Graded amounts (0.06, 0.2, 0.5, 1 g/kg, i.p. and 1, 2, 8 g/kg, p.o.) of the aqueous extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum leaf when given to both normal and alloxan-diabetic rats, a significant reduction of blood glucose concentration was noticed. On the other hand ethanolic extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum leaf produced no reduction in blood glucose concentration in normal rats but intra-peritoneal administration of 0.8 g/kg of the ethanolic leaf extract to diabetic rats produced a significant reduction of blood glucose concentration (p < 0.02) at 2 and 24 h only. Intraperitoneal and oral acute toxicity (LD50) and target organ effects were studied for the aqueous extract of Trigonella leaf in mice. LD50 of i.p. and oral administration were 1.9 and 10 g/kg respectively. The main organ affected after i.p. administration of the aqueous extract was the liver while oral administration of the aqueous extract of Trigonella did not produce any sign of organ damage. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of Trigonella foenum-graecum leaves given both orally and intraperitoneally possesses a hypoglycaemic effect in normoglycaemic and alloxan induced hyperglycaemic rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Basrah, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Abdel-Barry", "ForeName": "J A", "Initials": "JA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Abdel-Hassan", "ForeName": "I A", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Al-Hakiem", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperglycemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hypoglycemic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Intraperitoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "therapeutic use", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "1", "Day": "8", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9421250", "10.1016/s0378-8741(97)00101-3", "S0378874197001013"]}}]}
