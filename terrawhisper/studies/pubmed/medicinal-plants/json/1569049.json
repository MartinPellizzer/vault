WCI was encoded by a multigene family which comprised at least seven members. From their primary structures, four genes (WCI-2, WCI-3a, WCI-3b, and WCI-x) were expected to be functional ones and the other three (WCI-P1, WCI-P2, and WCI-P3) to be pseudogenes. The nucleotide sequences of the WCI-3a and WCI-3b genes were nearly identical, and they encoded the WCI-3 protein, the major chymotrypsin inhibitor in seeds. The WCI-2 gene also encoded the chymotrypsin inhibitor found in seeds and the WCI-x gene was expected to encode an unidentified chymotrypsin inhibitor. WCI messenger RNA and protein accumulated mainly in developing seeds and tuberous roots, small amounts of WCI mRNA being present in stems and pericarps. In seeds, transient accumulation of WCI mRNA was observed during the seed maturation period. These results suggest that the expression of WCI genes is regulated organ-specifically and developmentally in winged bean."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Hokkaido University."}], "LastName": "Habu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Peyachoknagul", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Umemoto", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakata", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohno", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["D13974", "D13975", "D13976", "L01141", "S96732", "S96733", "S96735", "S96741", "S96751", "S96754"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Biochem", "NlmUniqueID": "0376600", "ISSNLinking": "0021-924X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "37228-81-2", "NameOfSubstance": "proteinase inhibitor I (plants)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1569049", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123745"]}}]}
