The mouse model with lung injury induced endotoxin was established by peritoneal injection of LPS 1 h after the last administration. The ICR mice were pretreated with Total Alkaloids of Sophora Alopecuroides 25 mg/kg, Sophoridine 5 mg/kg, Oxymatrine 50 mg/kg and Sophocarpine 25 mg/kg for 3 days respectively. The anti-endotoxin effect of Total Alkaloids of Sophora Alopecuroides and the three kinds of pharmacoalkoids in vivo was studied by the general symptoms, white blood cell count, lung wet/dry weight, pathological histologic changes of lung tissues. CD14 and SR-A of lung tissue and serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 were detected by immunohistochemical and radioimmunity method.", "The general symptoms were improved, the number of white blood cells were increased, lung wet/dry weight was decreased and pathological changes of lung tissues were milder at different level. Meanwhile the expression of CD14 was decreased but the expression of SR-A increased in the lung tissue. Both the level of serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 were decrased.", "The damage of lung tissue in the mice with endotoxemia is inhibited by the Total Alkalids of Sophora Alopecuroides and the three kinds of pharmacoalkaloids at different level. The anti-endotoxin mechanism is associated with the regulating expression of LPS recognition receptor and down-regulating the expression of the down-stream inflammatory factors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology, Ningxia Medical College, Yinchuan 750004, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Han", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Ya", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Quan", "Initials": "Q"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Endotoxins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Scavenger Receptors, Class A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Endotoxins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunohistochemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Leukocyte Count"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lung"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Respiratory Distress Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Scavenger Receptors, Class A"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sophora"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17326410"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
