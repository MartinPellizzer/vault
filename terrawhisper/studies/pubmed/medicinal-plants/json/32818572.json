Hypoglycemic activity of the extracts was examined in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.", "For this purpose, pre-prandial blood sugar, insulin and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured. To investigate active substances that were responsible for the antidiabetic activity, phytochemical analysis was carried out with optimized and validated LC-MS/MS method using 53 phytochemicals in JT-FE. In addition, ICP-OES analysis was performed to determine the mineral content.", "The findings of the study demonstrate that when insulin and JT-FE applied groups were compared with the diabetic control group, their blood sugar and glycated hemoglobin levels were seen to statistically decrease (p\u00a0<\u00a00,001). Morewer, When JT-FE treated groups were compared with insulin-treated groups, a statistically decrease (p\u00a0<\u00a00,05) in their levels was observed. On the other hand, it was also found that the increase in extract concentration didn't contribute significantly to antidiabetic activity. As a result of the phytochemical analysis, total of 31 different phenolic compounds were defined in JT-FE. The major components of JT-FE (as analyte/g extract) were; rutin (98753.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.39\u00a0\u03bcg), catechin (58695.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.971\u00a0\u03bcg), hesperidin (47445.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.894\u00a0\u03bcg), quinic acid (38279.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.239\u00a0\u03bcg) and malic acid (17536.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.279\u00a0\u03bcg). In the mineral analysis we made; Sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus elements were found at macro level, Zn and Cr<sup>3+</sup> minerals were found at trace level.", "Our findings show that JT-FE, prepared by decoction, is rich in phenolic and mineral content and strong in antihyperglycemic activity. That's why Jerusalem thorn fruits can be a useful antidiabetic phytotherapy agent."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
