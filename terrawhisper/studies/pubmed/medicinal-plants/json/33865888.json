Studies have shown that many animal-derived medicinal products are susceptible to contaminate of aflatoxins, nevertheless, the rapid detection for animal-derived medicine is prone to be ignored. Here we developed a sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for rapid screening of aflatoxin B<sub>1</sub> (AFB<sub>1</sub>) in ground beetle, cockroach, silkworm and earthworm. The sensitivity of the icELISA method was significantly enhanced. The IC<sub>50</sub> for the four animal-derived medicinal samples ranged from 0.092 to 0.135\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>; the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.008-0.020\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup>-1</sup>. To obtain high accuracy, the extraction solution and time were evaluated. By using this method, a total of 138 samples were investigated, and the detection rates of AFB<sub>1</sub> in ground beetle and earthworm samples were 26.6% and 16.7%, respectively. The result was validated by liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, and an excellent correlation was observed between the two datasets, with a R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.999. Our results indicate that the proposed method can be used for the rapid detection of AFB<sub>1</sub> in animal-derived medicine. Furthermore, the quantitative risk assessment was conducted for ground beetle and earthworm based on the results, demonstrating that the intake of AFB<sub>1</sub> in ground beetle had a slight threat to the risk of cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
