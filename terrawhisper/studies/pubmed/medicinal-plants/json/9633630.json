Both essential oils showed antimicrobial activity against most of the micro-organisms examined except Clostridium sporogenes, Flavimonas oryzihabitans, and three species of Pseudomonas. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BMC against Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens in TSYE broth (as determined using an indirect impedance method) was 0.125 and 2% (v/v), respectively; the former was not greatly affected by the increase of challenge inoculum from 10(3) to 10(6) cfu ml-1. Results with resting cells demonstrated that BMC was bactericidal to both Aer. hydrophila and Ps. fluorescens. The growth of Aer. hydrophila in filter-sterilized lettuce extract was completely inhibited by 0.1% (v/v) BMC whereas that of Ps. fluorescens was not significantly affected by 1% (v/v) BMC. In addition, the effectiveness of washing fresh lettuce with 0.1 or 1% (v/v) BMC on survival of natural microbial flora was comparable with that effected by 125 ppm chlorine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Australian Food Industry Science Centre, Werribee, Victoria, Australia."}], "LastName": "Wan", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wilcock", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Coventry", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anisoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monoterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9NIW07V3ET", "NameOfSubstance": "estragole"}, {"RegistryNumber": "D81QY6I88E", "NameOfSubstance": "linalool"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z129UMU8LE", "NameOfSubstance": "basil oil"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acyclic Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aeromonas hydrophila"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anisoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Colony Count, Microbial"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lactuca"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Monoterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ocimum basilicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pseudomonas fluorescens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9633630", "10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00338.x"]}}]}
