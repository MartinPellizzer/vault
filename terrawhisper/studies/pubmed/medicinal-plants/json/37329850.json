However, it has well-documented hepatotoxicity. Lycopene (LCP) is a plant-derived carotenoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present work was designed to evaluate the potential hepatoprotective actions of LCP against CPF-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Animals were assigned into five groups namely: Group I (Control), Group II (LCP), Group III (CPF), Group IV (CPF + LCP 5\u00a0mg/kg), and Group V (CPF + LCP 10\u00a0mg/kg). LCP offered protection as evidenced by inhibiting the rise in serum activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) induced by CPF. This was confirmed histologically as LCP-treated animals showed liver tissues with less proliferation of bile ducts and periductal fibrosis. LCP significantly prevented the rise in hepatic content of malondialdehyde (MDA), depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), and exhaustion of glutathione-s-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Further, LCP significantly prevented hepatocyte death as it ameliorated the increase in Bax and the decrease in Bcl-2 expression induced by CPF in liver tissues as determined immunohistochemically. The observed protective effects of LCP were further confirmed by a significant enhancement in heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression. In conclusion, LCP possesses protective effects against CPF-induced hepatotoxicity. These include antioxidation and activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 axis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
