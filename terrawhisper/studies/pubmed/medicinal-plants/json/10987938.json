The naked carbon skeleton strategy is based on the production of all asymmetric centers by selective placement of the oxygen functions onto an unsaturated, nonfunctionalized carbon skeleton. Diversity in this approach arises from the relative timing of highly stereoselective reactions, such as the Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD) reaction, the Kennedy oxidative cyclization (OC) with rhenium(VII) oxide, the Mitsunobu-type alcohol epimerization reaction, and the Williamson etherification reaction. The convergent strategy, which is based on the combinatorial coupling of two series of diastereomeric fragments, to produce intermediates such as 11 and 12, enjoys the advantages of both efficiency and versatility. The third approach, which is based on partially functionalized intermediates, such as 13, combines the advantages of both the linear and the convergent strategies-synthetic efficiency and diversity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Avedissian", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yazbak", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Neogi", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sinha", "ForeName": "S C", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keinan", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Org Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "2985193R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3263"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Furans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "102989-24-2", "NameOfSubstance": "bullatacin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Ion Exchange"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemical synthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Furans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "9", "Day": "16", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10987938", "10.1021/jo000500a", "jo000500a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
