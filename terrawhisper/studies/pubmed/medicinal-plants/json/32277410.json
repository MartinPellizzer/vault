Vetiver grass was grown hydroponically in influent (IN) and four different effluent (EF) sewages including control, 125 (EF125), 250 (EF250), and 500 (EF500) mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. During 18\u00a0days, phosphate concentration gradually declined in both influent and all effluent treatments. Unlike effluent treatments, the amount of ammonium in influent was greater than the standard (39.52\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>) and decreased severely down to 4.85\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> at the end of the experiment. After just 48\u00a0h, the concentration of nitrate in EF treatment reached 2.25\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> that is lower than the standard. The decrease of nitrate to concentrations less than the standard was also observed at days 8, 11, and 18 in EF125, EF250, and EF500 treatments, respectively, and about 90% of nitrate had been removed from 500\u00a0mg\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup> Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> treatment. Other ions such as Cl<sup>-</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> decreased in influent and all effluent sewages due to phytoremediation process. Accordingly, phytoremediation by vetiver grass could decrease concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, chloride, and calcium in influent and all effluent sewages. Increasing the concentration of nitrate resulted in the increase in its uptake rate. In addition, a positive correlation was shown between the uptake rate of nitrate by vetiver grass and the duration of cultivation of this plant in nitrate-containing medium."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Specific Service Center for Processing of Native Medicinal Plants, Academic Center of Education Culture and Research (ACECR), Golestan Branch, Gorgan, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholipour", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Basic Science, Faculty of Animal Science and Fisheries, Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University, P.O.
