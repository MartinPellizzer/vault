The findings suggest that jamu has an antifertility effect in both these rodents. This effect appears to be dose dependent and in addition the stage at which it was fed also appears to be crucial for the effect to manifest. Rahwana is effective when fed on day 4 of gestation. However jamu Kursani does not appear to be dose dependent and is effective when fed on days 1 and 4 of gestation. Jamu Rahwana does not alter the LH or estrogen levels in rats. Therefore, the induction of the antifertility effect is suggested to be by means other than hormonal. It is felt that jamu either inhibits the implantation of the zygote or causes resorption of the fetus. Whether any antifertility effect exists in women using jamu remain to be clarified. The mechanism of action, its reliability and effectiveness as a contraceptive, the side effects, if any, pharmacology of the active ingredient and other relevant investigations need to be carried out before it can be recommended for human use. The study does indicate that jamu has potential as an antifertility agent and could be effectively used in fertility regulation."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["031785", "00139057"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Animals, Laboratory", "Asia", "Clinical Research", "Contraception", "Contraception Research", "Contraceptive Agents", "Contraceptive Agents, Female", "Contraceptive Agents, Postcoital", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Disintegration Of Blastocyst", "Economic Factors", "Estrogens", "Family Planning", "Female Contraception", "Fertilization", "Health", "Health Services", "Implantation Suppression", "Luteinizing Hormone", "Malaysia", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproductive Control Agents", "Research And Development", "Research Methodology", "Research Report", "Southeastern Asia", "Technology"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12313336", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1985", "Month": "04", "Day": "12"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2006", "Month": "09", "Day": "06"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0127-3213", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "1", "Issue": "2", "PubDate": {"Year": "1983", "Month": "Dec"}}, "Title": "Malaysian journal of reproductive health : a publication of the Reproductive Research Centre of the National Population and Family Development Board, Malaysia", "ISOAbbreviation": "Malays J Reprod Health"}, "ArticleTitle": "Antifertility effect of Jamu (traditional herbal medicine).", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "176", "EndPage": "180", "MedlinePgn": "176-80"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Azimahtol Hawariah Lope Pihie"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Embun Naim"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Malaysia", "MedlineTA": "Malays J Reprod Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8804319", "ISSNLinking": "0127-3213"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Estrogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reproductive Control Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-67-9", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteinizing Hormone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals, Laboratory"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Blastocyst"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Embryo Implantation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Estrogens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fertilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Luteinizing Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproductive Control Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Technology"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1983", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1983", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12313336"]}}]}
