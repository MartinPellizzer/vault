Twelve Jersey and 24 Holstein early lactation cows were fed one of four TMR at 32.5:32.5:35.0 haycrop silage:corn silage:concentrate (DM basis) containing a combination of treated and untreated silages from d 2 to 100 of lactation. Bunker silages were incubated twice in situ in fistulated cows in each dietary treatment to determine rates of DM and NDF degradation. Treatment of haycrop silage significantly reduced silage pH and acetic acid concentration and increased titratable acidity, lactic acid concentration, lactate: acetate ratio, and DM and NDF disappearances after 24 h of ruminal incubation. Treated haycrop silage increased DMI:BW ratio and daily production of milk, milk protein, and SNF of early lactation cows. Application of the experimental mixture to corn silage did not change silage fermentation or composition, except that the concentration of NH3 was reduced. Enxyme-treated corn silage did not improve DMI and slightly reduced daily milk production in early lactation cows."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal, Veterinary and Aquatic Sciences, University of Maine, Orono 04469."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Stokes", "ForeName": "M R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wallace", "ForeName": "C R", "Initials": "CR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Dairy Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "2985126R", "ISSNLinking": "0022-0302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aerobiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Preservation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Poaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rumen"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Silage"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8182174", "10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)76978-2", "S0022-0302(94)76978-2"]}}]}
