Exosome-like nanovesicles derived from medicinal plants have shown great potential as novel biotherapeutics for cancer therapy by delivering their incorporated nucleic acids, especially microRNAs (miRNAs), to mammalian cells. In this study, we isolated exosome-like nanovesicles derived from B. javanica (BF-Exos) and investigated their influence and underlying molecular mechanisms in TNBC. We found that BF-Exos delivered 10 functional miRNAs to 4T1 cells, significantly retarding the growth and metastasis of 4T1 cells by regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and promoting ROS/caspase-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, BF-Exos were shown to inhibit the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor, contributing to anti-angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. In vivo, BF-Exos inhibited tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis in breast tumor mouse models, while maintaining high biosafety. Overall, BF-Exos are considered promising nanoplatforms for the delivery of medicinal plant-derived nucleic acids, with great potential to be developed into novel biotherapeutics for the treatment of TNBC."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
