Heat treatment was also used to bias this selection towards spore-forming bacteria. Ninety-two bacterial isolates were obtained, 72 of which were provisionally characterized as species of Bacillus. Four of these Bacillus isolates (B3, C1, D4 and J7) displayed distinct antagonism in vitro against Botrytis cinerea and P. mamillatum when screened using dual culture analysis. Further characterization of these antagonists using API 50CHB biochemical profiling identified isolate D4 as Bacillus polymyxa and isolates B3, C1 and J7 as strains of B. subtilis. In vitro screening techniques, using cell-free and heat-killed extracts of liquid cultures against Botrytis cinerea, demonstrated the production of antifungal compounds by these four Bacillus antagonists. With each isolate the antifungal activity was found not to be either exclusively spore-bound nor released entirely into the medium but present in both fractions. The antifungal compounds produced by these isolates were shown to be heat-stable. Their identification, production and release require further study for exploitation as biocontrol systems."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agriculture, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. walker@mserv.res.bbsrc.ac.uk"}], "LastName": "Walker", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Powell", "ForeName": "A A", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Seddon", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9706280", "ISSNLinking": "1364-5072"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibiosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitosporic Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pisum sativum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pest Control, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Pythium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "7", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9674133", "10.1046/j.1365-2672.1998.00411.x"]}}]}
