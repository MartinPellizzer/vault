(Boraginaceae) is a perennial medicinal plant and vegetable that is cultivated commercially in China. Anthracnose is a devastating disease of <i>B. paridiformis</i>, with annual production losses exceeding 33% based on our survey. In July 2021, anthracnose of <i>B. paridiformis</i> was observed on 2-year-old plants in Shenyang city, Northeast China, which is the most important region for <i>B. paridiformis</i> cultivation. Round or irregular-shaped black spots were exhibited on leaves, with the leaf edges most commonly infected. As the necrosis expanded, the leaves withered and dropped; young leaves were generally not infected (Fig. 1). More than 40% of the plants in a 21-ha sampling field were infected in 2021. Symptomatic leaves (n = 20) were collected and the diseased tissue was cut into small pieces, immersed in 1% NaOCl for 2 min, rinsed three times with sterile water, and placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes. After a 3-day incubation in darkness at 25 \u00b0C, 18 suspected single-pure morphologically identical <i>Colletotrichum</i> isolates were obtained and sequenced. Isolate SQZ9 was randomly selected and identified. Colonies on PDA were initially white, but gradually became pale brownish with a reverse side that was pale yellowish to pinkish. Aerial mycelia were grayish-white, dense, and cottony, with microsclerotia detected on some aging mycelia. The detected single-celled conidia (11.65-17.25 \u00d7 4.25-6.15 \u00b5m; n = 50) were fusiform to cylindrical with obtuse to slightly rounded ends. Appressoria were ovoid to clavate and medium brown. Setae were not observed. The morphological characteristics were similar to those of <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. (Prihastuti et al. 2009; Weir et al. 2012). Initial BLAST searches of the GenBank database revealed the SQZ9 rDNA internal transcribed spacer region (OP389109, 566 bp), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (OP407730, 260 bp), chitin synthase (OP407731, 301 bp), calmodulin (OP407732, 712 bp), actin (OP407733, 282 bp), glutamine synthetase (OP407734, 909 bp), \u03b2-tublin (OP407735, 498 bp), and superoxide dismutase (OP407736, 396 bp) sequences were respectively 99%-100% similar to the C. siamense type strain JX010278, JX010019, JX009709, GQ856775, GQ856730, JX010100, JX010410, and JX010332 sequences (Carbone & Kohn 1999; Moriwaki & Tsukiboshi 2009; Stephenson et al. 1997). The SQZ9 identity was confirmed by constructing a phylogenetic tree combining all loci, which grouped the isolate and the <i>C. siamense</i> type strain in the same clade (Fig. 2). For pathogenicity tests, 15 healthy 2-year-old plants (3 plants per pot) were spray-inoculated with SQZ9 conidial suspension (1 \u00d7 105 conidia/mL) at 2 mL per plant. Same number of plants sprayed with water were used as control. This experiment was repeated twice. All plants were covered with clear plastic bags for 72 h to maintain high humidity and then placed in a greenhouse (29 \u00b0C, natural light, and 85% relative humidity). After six days, the inoculated leaves exhibited symptoms that were similar to those observed in the field, but the controls were symptomless. The same fungus was recovered from inoculated symptomatic leaves, and its identity was confirmed by sequencing and a phylogenetic analysis. This is the first report of <i>C. siamense</i> causing anthracnose on <i>B. paridiformis</i> in China. Future studies should assess the effectiveness of chemical and biological control measures for managing this disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 4899, Juye, Changchun, Jilin, China, 130112; 35873558@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Yiming", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, 58575, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, Liaoning, China; chengtao1984317@163.com."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "Hai-Tao", "Initials": "HT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Changchun, Jilin, China; 419192448@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin Lin", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, 4899, Juye, Changchun, Jilin, China, 130112; zhangyue@caas.cn."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Changchun, Jlin, China; 106717634@qq.com."}], "LastName": "Pan", "ForeName": "Xiao Xi", "Initials": "XX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Juye street, Changchun, Jilin, China, 130112; iamjinqiao@126.com."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Qiao", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, No.4899 Juye Street, Jingyue District,, Changchun, Jlin, China, 130112; wangqiuxia1018@126.com."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Qiu-Xia", "Initials": "QX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Acadamy of Agricultural Science, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Changchun, Jlin, China; liuning198219@163.com."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Ning", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 12661, Institute of Special Wild Economic Animal and Plant Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Juye Street No. 4899, Changchun, Jilin, China, 130112."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "United States; zyy1966999@yeah.net."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ya Yu", "Initials": "YY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "10", "Day": "24", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["37874285", "10.1094/PDIS-07-23-1465-PDN"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
