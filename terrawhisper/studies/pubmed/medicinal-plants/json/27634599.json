Pre-operative TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were inversely correlated with post-operative pain scores during walking (r<sub>S</sub>=-0.26, P=0.03) and with change of pain at rest during six weeks after TKA (r<sub>s</sub>=-0.28, P=0.03) and were directly correlated with a higher post-operative Knee Society score (KSS) (r<sub>S</sub>=0.43, P<0.001) and with greater increases in this score during six weeks after TKA (r<sub>S</sub>=0.33, P=0.001). Mean TNF-\u03b1 concentrations were higher in the 39 patients reporting any pre-operative pain at rest than in 36 patients reporting no pre-operative pain (P=0.015) and were the only independent predictor of pre-operative pain at rest (OR=13, P=0.02). Independent predictors of better post-operative knee function were higher log-transformed TNF-\u03b1 concentrations (\u03b2=0.38, P=0.002) and male sex (\u03b2=0.28, P=0.02).", "High levels of pre-operative TNF-\u03b1 concentrations could be used as an independent predictor of better knee function at six weeks of follow-up. In patients with lower pre-operative TNF-\u03b1 concentrations, post-operative pain management may improve the early outcome of the operated joint."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.
