For example, the TY River in Jiangsu Province has been associated with complex odors, whereas the specific odor compounds were not clear. In this paper, a comprehensive study on characterizing the odors and odorants in source water from the TY River was conducted. Six odor types, including earthy, marshy, fishy, woody, medicinal, and chemical odors, were detected for the first time; correspondingly, thirty-three odor-causing compounds were identified. By means of evaluating odor activity values and reconstituting the identified odorants, 95, 93, 92, 90, 89 and 88% of the earthy, marshy, fishy, woody, medicinal and chemical odors in the source waters could be clarified. Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol were associated with earthy odor, while amyl sulfide, dibutyl sulfide, propyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide and indole were related to marshy odor. The major woody and fishy odor compounds were vanillin, geraniol, \u03b2-cyclocitral and 2,4-decadienal, 2-octenal, respectively. Medicinal and chemical odors were mainly caused by 2-chlorophenol, 4-bromophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol and naphthalene, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene, respectively. This is the first study in which six odor types and thirty-three odorants were identified simultaneously in a river-type micro-polluted water source, which can offer a reference for odor management in drinking water treatment plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
