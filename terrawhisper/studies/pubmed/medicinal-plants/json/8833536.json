Separate balance experiments were conducted to assess the potential of 2 commercial enzyme supplements to improve the nutritive value of dehulled lupin kernels. One supplement (enzyme A) contained primarily xylanase, pentosanase, hemicellulase activities and the other (enzyme B) primarily beta-glucanase, hemicellulase and pectinase activities. 2. The enzymes were added at 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 g/kg in diets containing (g/kg) lupins 300, sorghum 543, casein 91, celite (as marker) 20, and vitamins and minerals 46. Control diets, with and without enzyme supplementation contained sorghum and casein at 800 and 134 g/kg, respectively, and no lupins. 3. Growth rates and food conversion ratios (FCR) of birds over 7 days were not affected by lupin inclusion or enzyme supplementation. FCR of broilers fed on the sorghum diet was improved by enzyme A but not by enzyme B. 4. Ileal starch digestibilities were slightly lower in birds fed on the lupin control diet (no enzyme) compared to the basal control diet. 5. Enzyme A increased the AME of the lupins from 10.01 MJ/kg DM to 11.65 MJ/kg DM when added at 0.5 g/kg. Higher rates of supplementation did not lead to further increases in AME values. 6. Enzyme A did not improve starch digestion in the diets but insoluble non-starch polysaccharides concentration in the digesta decreased (50.41-42.71 g/g acid insoluble ash marker) with increasing enzyme supplementation, suggesting that the improvement in AME was the result of increased fermentation of fibre in the hindgut. 7. Enzyme B did not affect the AME of lupins nor the ileal digestibility of nutrients, but caused an increase in the concentrations of soluble non-starch polysaccharides in the ileal digesta of chickens (19.21-35.77 mg/ml). This was accompanied by an increase in ileal digesta viscosity (11.4-34.2 m.Pa/s)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "CSIRO Division of Human Nutrition, SA, Australia."}], "LastName": "Annison", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "R J", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Choct", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Br Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "15740290R", "ISSNLinking": "0007-1668"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "hemicellulase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.15", "NameOfSubstance": "Polygalacturonase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.32", "NameOfSubstance": "Xylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Endo-1,4-beta Xylanases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Chickens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endo-1,4-beta Xylanases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Energy Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoside Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Polygalacturonase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Xylan Endo-1,3-beta-Xylosidase"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Xylosidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucosidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8833536", "10.1080/00071669608417845"]}}]}
