So it is being used clinically in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia in China. In the present study, the water extracts of Ermiao wan and phellodendri cortex at 840 and 480 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days were demonstrated to possess in vivo potent hypouricemic effects both in hyperuricemic mice pretreated with oxonate and in normal mice, respectively. In the hyperuricemic animals, the effect of Ermiao wan was equal to that of the reference drug allopurinol (at 10 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days), but in the normal mice, the former was weaker than latter. In addition, both Ermiao wan and phellodendri cortex were found to have in vivo relatively inhibitory effects on mouse liver xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and xanthine oxidase (XO) activities at the same dose described above. These inhibitory effects were weaker than that observed for allopurinol. Atractylodis rhizome at 340 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days did not show any effects on the above experiments. These results suggested that atractylodis rhizomes assisted and enhanced the effect of phellodendri cortex on reduction of serum uric acid level in hyperuricemic mice, and hypouricemic effects of Ermiao wan and phellodendri cortex may be achieved by other mechanism partly instead of the XDH and XO inhibition."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Institute of Functional Biomolecule, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, People's Republic of China. kongld@nju.edu.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kong", "ForeName": "Ling Dong", "Initials": "LD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chen", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ge", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hai Dong", "Initials": "HD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guo", "ForeName": "Yu Song", "Initials": "YS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "268B43MJ25", "NameOfSubstance": "Uric Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.1.4", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.17.3.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthine Oxidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hyperuricemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Bark"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Uric Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Dehydrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthine Oxidase"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "12"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "11", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "7", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15234772", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.04.008", "S0378874104001825"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
