Previous studies found that sulfur-fumigation, a post-harvest handling process developed to prevent mold contamination of medicinal herbs, altered the quality of BS. However, whether sulfur-fumigation affects the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of BS warrants further investigation.", "To evaluate the feasibility of sulfur-fumigation as a post-harvest handling process of BS from the viewpoints of pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy.", "The pharmacokinetic behaviors of four active components of BS and one characteristic component of sulfur-fumigated BS (S-BS) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (HPLC-TQ-MS/MS). The safety was investigated using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) based metabolomics approach after intragastric (i.g.) administration of non-fumigated BS (N-BS) and S-BS in rats. The analgesic efficacy was compared using hot-plate test in mice, after i.g. administration of N-BS and S-BS, at both high and low dosages.", "Systemic exposures of paeoniflorin and oxypaeoniflorin, two analgesic components of BS, were significantly decreased in the S-BS treated group compared to the N-BS treated group, while paeoniflorin sulfonate, one of the sulfur-containing derivatives of S-BS, was detected in all time-points of S-BS treated group with the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC<sub>0-t</sub>) and the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) as high as 7077.06 \u00b1 2232.97ng/mL*h and 1641.42 \u00b1 634.79ng/mL respectively, which indicated that sulfur-fumigation altered the pharmacokinetic behaviors of BS. Besides, paeoniflorin sulfonate and its four metabolites with ambiguous toxicities, as well as one endogenous metabolite p-cresol glucuronide, the biomarker of disordered homeostasis of intestinal bacteria and bile acid, were identified as the characteristic metabolites in S-BS administered rats, suggesting that sulfur-fumigation reduced the safety of BS. Furthermore, the analgesic effects at both low and high dosages were decreased in different extent when compared to N-BS administered groups, indicating that sulfur-fumigation weakened the efficacy of BS.", "Sulfur-fumigation altered the pharmacokinetics, as well as reduced the safety and efficacy of BS, suggesting that sulfur-fumigation is not recommended for post-harvest handling of BS."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
