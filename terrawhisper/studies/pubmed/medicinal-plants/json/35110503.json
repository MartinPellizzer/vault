Proteins and peptides in crude drugs may be digested and metabolized in the digestive tract and liver. However, few studies have reported the pharmacological activity of peptides in crude drugs. Here, we applied an analysis using LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the compounds derived from six crude drugs that are assumed to have anti-inflammatory effects. To simulate in vivo protease digestion, each water-soluble fraction of the crude drug extracts was treated with proteases, including endoproteinases and exopeptidases. Amines in the resultant digests were modified by 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate and analyzed using LC-MS/MS, which demonstrated the presence of four decarboxylated amino acids (primary amines). In the digest of the hydrophilic fraction of the fruit of Ziziphus jujuba Miller var. inermis Rehder (Taiso), isobutylamine, isoamylamine, and 2-methylbutylamine were identified, which may be derived from valinyl, leucinyl, and isoleucinyl residues, respectively. Additionally, tyramine possibly derived from tyrosyl residues was identified in the digests of all the crude drugs. In primary cultured rat hepatocytes treated with interleukin-1\u03b2, all these decarboxylated amino acids suppressed the production of nitric oxide, a proinflammatory mediator. Our approach, i.e., in vitro protease digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis, suggests that decarboxylated amino acids may be formed in vivo from peptides and may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of crude drugs included in Kampo medicine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University."}], "LastName": "Shirako", "ForeName": "Saki", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Applied Biosciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University."}], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "Kenji", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University."}], "LastName": "Moriwaki", "ForeName": "Saki", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center for Supporting Pharmaceutical Education, Daiichi University of Pharmacy."}], "LastName": "Ikeya", "ForeName": "Yukinobu", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Ritsumeikan University."}], "LastName": "Nishizawa", "ForeName": "Mikio", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptide Hydrolases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Japan"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Kampo"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptide Hydrolases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "30"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35110503", "10.1248/bpb.b21-00623"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
