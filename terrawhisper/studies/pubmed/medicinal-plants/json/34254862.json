Dairy products containing <i>S. boulardii</i> have been revealed to possess potential probiotic activities owing to their ability to produce organic acids, essential enzymes, vitamins, and other important metabolites such as vanillic acid, phenyl ethyl alcohol, and erythromycin. <i>S. boulardii</i> has a wide spectrum of anti-carcinogenic, antibacterial antiviral, and antioxidant activity, and is known to reduce serum cholesterol levels. However, this yeast has mainly been prescribed for prophylaxis treatment of gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and stimulating the immune system in a number of commercially available products. The present comprehensive review article reviews the properties of <i>S. boulardii</i> related to their use in fermented dairy foods as a probiotic microorganism or starter culture. Technical aspects regarding the integration of this yeast into the dairy foods matrix its health advantages, therapeutic functions, microencapsulation, and viability in harsh conditions, and safety aspects are highlighted."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Tehran, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Health Management and Safety Promotion Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Iranian EBM Centre: A Joanna Briggs Institute Affiliated Group."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Fereshteh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Faculty of Veterinary of Medicine, Amol University of Special Modern Technology, Amol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alian Samakkhah", "ForeName": "Shohre", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Sarab Faculty of Medical Sciences, Sarab, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahadori", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Comparative Bioscience, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Tehran University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari", "ForeName": "Seyedeh Maedeh", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ziaee", "ForeName": "Mojtaba", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Public Health, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khodayari", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taghi", "Initials": "MT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Dietary Supplements and Probiotic Research Center, Karaj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourjafar", "ForeName": "Hadi", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Review", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "8914818", "ISSNLinking": "1040-8398"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Saccharomyces boulardii"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Probiotics"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dairy Products"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "1", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "13", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34254862", "10.1080/10408398.2021.1949577"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
