H. Karst. is a traditionally used, well-recognized medicinal plant of the family Gentianaceae with significant therapeutic potential. It has been traditionally used to cure various ailments such as fever, vomiting, jaundice, digestive disorders, heart diseases, diabetes, malaria, scorpion bite, and skin diseases.", "The present review emphasized the traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, chemical profiling, and structural identification of isolated compounds by analytical and spectroscopic techniques. This review demonstrates the possibility of advanced ethnopharmacological research.", "The literature on S. chirayita was obtained from bibliographic databases like Web of Science, PubMed, Science-Direct, American Chemical Society (ACS), Google Scholar, and SciFinder. The compiled review is covered up until March 2022.", "Approximately, 123 specialized metabolites including xanthones, seco-iridoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and flavonoids have been isolated and characterized from S. chirayita. The extract and isolated compounds exhibited a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, hepatoprotective, antiviral, antimalarial, and antibacterial offering scientific evidence for traditional claims of this medicinal plant. In addition, various analytical methods using HPTLC, UPLC, HPLC, LC-MS, and GC-MS have also been documented to determine the phytochemicals of S. chirayita.", "The current article provides information on traditional usage, phytochemistry, chemical profiling, structure elucidation, pharmacological efficacy, toxicity, and future prospects of S. chirayita. This plant has long been traditionally used in a variety of ways by indigenous people. Numerous phytoconstituents and several pharmacological activities have been reported in S. chirayita. However, there are still some scientific gaps such as identification of bioactive compounds, structure-activity relationship and mechanistic action of isolated bioactive compounds, development of effective analytical methods for comprehensive quality control, and safety profiles that need to be addressed."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.
