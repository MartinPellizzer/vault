Dietary factors significantly impact the risk, advancement, and treatment of cardiometabolic conditions. Chocolate, known for its adaptability and capacity to stimulate pleasure centers, emerges as a promising vehicle for integrating different bioactive elements. This systematic review analyzed 10 randomized controlled trials investigating the health effects of consuming enriched, fortified, or supplemented chocolate. These trials varied in chocolate intake amounts (ranging from 5 to 101 g day<sup>-1</sup>), incorporated bioactive components (co-crystalized astaxanthin, lycopene, wood-based phytosterol-phytostanol mixture, canola sterol esters, <i>etc</i>.), and duration (from 2 weeks to 1 year). Some enriched chocolates were found to reduce total and LDL cholesterol and influence markers of oxidative damage, inflammation, immune function, and skin parameters. However, certain trials showed a minimal impact on health outcomes. Therefore, while enriched chocolate holds promise as a carrier for beneficial bioactive compounds, rigorous scientific inquiry and methodological rigor are crucial to fully substantiate these claims. Comprehensive evaluations covering cardiovascular health, metabolic function, immune response, and other aspects are needed to understand its potential benefits and limitations. Advancing robust research initiatives could help realize the full potential of enriched chocolate in promoting human health and well-being."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-2744-8270"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, \"Iuliu Ha\u0163ieganu\" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania."}], "LastName": "Frumuzachi", "ForeName": "Oleg", "Initials": "O"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8055-9215"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania. mihai.babota@umfst.ro."}], "LastName": "Babot\u0103", "ForeName": "Mihai", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4314-1797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania. mihai.babota@umfst.ro."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania."}], "LastName": "Tanase", "ForeName": "Corneliu", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5848-8457"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, \"George Emil Palade\" University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Sciences and Technology of T\u00e2rgu Mures, T\u00e2rgu Mures, Romania."}], "LastName": "Mocan", "ForeName": "Andrei", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Food Funct", "NlmUniqueID": "101549033", "ISSNLinking": "2042-6496"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Cardiovascular Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Chocolate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food, Fortified"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Functional Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "50"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "41"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "6", "Day": "12", "Hour": "7", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38864465", "10.1039/d4fo01574f"]}}]}
