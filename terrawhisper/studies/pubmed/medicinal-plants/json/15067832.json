This study was performed to study the possible role of indigenous medicinal plants in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus (type-2)", "Normal rabbits were divided into 5 groups (1-5) of six animals each. Group I served as control and received 15 ml of water only. Group 2 received tolbutamide 500-mg/Kg body weight. Group 3-5 received the extract of Ficus relegiosa dissolved in 15 ml of water in doses of 200 mg/Kg. 250 mg/Kg and 300 mg/Kg body weight respectively. The diabetic rabbits were also divided in 5 groups on the same pattern. The blood glucose and total lipid levels were estimated before and 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after the administration of the extract.", "The extract exerted a significant (P < 0.05) hypoglycemic effect in normal rabbits, which was however short lived. The hypoglycemic effect was not significant (P > 0.05) in alloxan treated rabbits. The extract had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on total lipid levels in normal as well as in alloxan-treated diabetic rabbits. The doses used did not show acute toxicity or result in behavioral changes.", "From this study it may be concluded that the extract acts by initiating the release of insulin by pancreatic beta cells of normal rabbits."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Khyber Medical College, Peshawar."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wadood", "ForeName": "Noreen", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wadood", "ForeName": "Abdul", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nisar", "ForeName": "Mohammed", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad", "NlmUniqueID": "8910750", "ISSNLinking": "1025-9589"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "982XCM1FOI", "NameOfSubstance": "Tolbutamide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Islets of Langerhans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lipids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Tolbutamide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Urticaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15067832"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
