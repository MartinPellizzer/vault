The World Health Organization observed that 80% of world population still rely on traditional practices of special cultural heritages. In Asia, the traditional practices include mainly that of the Middle East, India and China. The 3000 years of development in the three different regions has resulted in cross-cultural influences and exchanges, particularly revealed in the rich collections of medicinal herbs. Ayurveda medicine has well maintained its traditional philosophy and practice. It has enjoyed very substantial governmental support on the national level and has remained popular. Traditional Chinese Medicine, likewise, has kept its popularity and vibrance. However, with the ever advancing modern medicine which is giving efficient acute care and specific solutions to known target areas of clinical concern, are unavoidable obstacles to an integrative practice. Besides India, China is the only country in the world where Traditional Medicine is still playing a major role in national health care. During the COVID-19 pandemic both Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine practitioners tried hard to contribute by offering integrative treatment to the infected patients. They were getting a lot of national and professional endorsements. One would speculate that with this unknown virus and diverse clinical presentations, a better integrative program would be able to provide better outcome. On the prevention side, medicinal herbs are expected to be able to boost up the innate immunity of the individual so that infection could be better resisted. Given the similarities between the Indian and Chinese Systems of traditional practice, it is suggested that Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine could develop a joint mission with combined efforts, to collaborate in research and trials, with the aim of consolidating Integrative Practice. This article concentrates on the Indian and Chinese areas of traditional practice, viz. Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
