The most common products were echinacea (4/45, 8.9%), pregnancy tea (4/45, 8.9%), and ginger (3/45, 6.7%). The most common reasons for beginning or discontinuing use of dietary supplements were to relieve nausea and vomiting (5/20, 25%) and to avoid potential harm to the fetus (5/20, 25%). All side effects were mild and included gastrointestinal discomfort in a patient using elderberry, taste disturbance in a patient using echinacea, and intestinal gas in a patient using borage seed oil. Most patients informed their primary care provider of their use of dietary supplements (15/20, 75%).", "The use of dietary supplements among pregnant women is low but is of concern because of the lack of safety data.
