Most derivatives, especially 14b and 16b, demonstrated significant efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, as well as pleuromutilin-resistant strains. Compound 16b showed high stability in the liver microsomes of rats and humans, along with acceptable tolerance in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, compound 16b exhibited promising efficacy in MRSA-infected mouse models. Our data highlight the potential of conjugated pleuromutilin derivatives as valuable agents against drug-resistant bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
