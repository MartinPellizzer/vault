These have shaped the cultures around the globe. From underlings to elderly persons, everyone has come across to use herbal medicine for minor infection to deadly diseases. A wholesome approach is needed to maximize the knowledge about traditional resources. Thus, combining it with the new advents of technology is miraculous. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the prevalent infections in the world. Increasing multi-drug resistance among uropathogens is quite problematic. The burning field of nanotechnology offers an enormous help in revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The nanoparticles and nanocarriers can increase the bioavailability and efficacy of phytoconstituents targeted against the uropathogens. The present review focuses on herbal medicine and nanomaterials like nanoparticles, nanocarriers, nanoantibiotics as potent anti-bacterial agents against urinary tract infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Devi", "ForeName": "Nisha", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Rani", "ForeName": "Kanika", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology, Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar 125004, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Kharb", "ForeName": "Pushpa", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Biotechnology, Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Hisar 125001, Haryana, India."}], "LastName": "Prasad", "ForeName": "Minakshi", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nanosci Nanotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "101088195", "ISSNLinking": "1533-4880"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nanotechnology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Tract Infections"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "20", "Minute": "6"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34739801", "10.1166/jnn.2021.19002"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
