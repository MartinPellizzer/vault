This work aimed to determine if presenting classic papers during didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology among undergraduate students. Twenty-two students of health information technology were randomly divided into the following two groups: 1) didactic lecture only (control group) and 2) didactic lecture plus paper presentation breaks (DLPP group). In the control group, main topics of gastrointestinal and endocrine physiology were taught using only the didactic lecture technique. In the DLPP group, some topics were presented by the didactic lecture method (similar to the control group) and some topics were taught by the DLPP technique (first, concepts were covered briefly in a didactic format and then reinforced with presentation of a related classic paper). The combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks significantly improved learning so that students in the DLPP group showed higher scores on related topics compared with those in the control group (P < 0.001). Comparison of the scores of topics taught by only the didactic lecture and those using both the didactic lecture and paper breaks showed significant improvement only in the DLPP group (P < 0.001). Data obtained from the final exam showed that in the DLPP group, the mean score of the topics taught by the combination of didactic lecture and paper breaks was significantly higher than those taught by only didactic lecture (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of paper presentation breaks and didactic lectures improves the learning of physiology."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 The American Physiological Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran; and ghorbania@mums.ac.ir."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Microbiology and Virology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazvini", "ForeName": "Kiarash", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Physiol Educ", "NlmUniqueID": "100913944", "ISSNLinking": "1043-4046"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curriculum"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Educational Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["education"], "DescriptorName": "Physiology"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Problem-Based Learning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Students"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Teaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "12", "Day": "15", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26873895", "10.1152/advan.00137.2015", "40/1/93"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
