Schrad is extensively used to treat diabetes, obesity, fever, cancer, amenorrhea, jaundice, leukemia, rheumatism, and respiratory diseases. Chemical studies have indicated the presence of several cucurbitacins, flavones, and other polyphenols in this plant. These phytochemical constituents are responsible for the interesting antioxidant and other biological activities of C. colocynthis.", "In the present study, for the first time, near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled with partial least square (PLS) regression analysis was used to quantify the polyphenolic phytochemicals of C. colocynthis.", "The fruit and aerial parts of the C. colocynthis were extracted individually in methanol followed by fractionation in n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and water. Near infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained in absorption mode in the wavelength range 700-2500\u00a0nm. The PLS regression model was then built from the obtained spectral data to quantify the total polyphenol contents in the selected plant samples.", "The PLS regression model obtained had a R<sup>2</sup> value of 99% with a 0.98 correlationship value and a good prediction with a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) value of 1.89% and correlation of 0.98. These results were further confirmed through UV-vis spectroscopy and it is found that the ethyl acetate fraction has the maximum value for polyphenol contents (101.7\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g; NIR, 100.4\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g; UV-vis).", "The polyphenolic phytochemicals of the fruit and aerial parts of C. colocynthis have been quantified successfully by using multivariate analysis in a non-destructive, economical, precise, and highly sensitive method, which uses very simple sample preparation.
