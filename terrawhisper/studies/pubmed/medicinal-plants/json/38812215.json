Dao-di medicinal material, as an important source of medicinal plants, is a unique quality concept and comprehensive standard of tranditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Several databases have been developed in China and abroad, such as the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine(ETCM) and the Global Pharmacopoeia Genome Database(GPGD). Yet, most databases do not provide multi-dimensional data, including geographic data, phenotype data, compound data, and genetic data. Sichuan, known as the hometown of TCM therapies and the treasure trove of TCM, is the most representative region of medicinal plant diversity in China. According to the latest data of the fourth national survey of TCM resources, there are more than 8 000 TCM and 86 Dao-di medicinal materials in Sichuan province. Based on resource census data and relevant achievements, this study constructed the bioinformatics database of medicinal plants and the visual analysis platform of production layout by taking the Dao-di medicinal materials in Sichuan province as an example, covering geographic data, phenotype data, compound data, and genetic data. It effectively integrates multi-dimensional data of Dao-di medicinal materials and provides different levels of data interaction applications. The platform is the first large-scale multi-dimensional database and visual platform of Dao-di medicinal materials in Sichuan province, which serves as an essential resource for germplasm resources identification, decomposition of biosynthetic pathways, molecular breeding of varieties and provides medicinal plant resource information and data support for development and utilization of medicinal plants in China and abroad."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Key Lab of Biological Evaluation of TCM Quality of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Translational Chinese Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Sichuan Provincial Engineering Research Center of Formation Principle and Quality Evaluation of Genuine Medicinal Materials Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Hua", "ForeName": "Hua", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Key Lab of Biological Evaluation of TCM Quality of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Translational Chinese Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Sichuan Provincial Engineering Research Center of Formation Principle and Quality Evaluation of Genuine Medicinal Materials Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Wei-Wei", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Digital City Engineering Center, the Third Geographical Information Mapping Institute of Natural Resources Ministry Chengdu 610100, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Jiong-Yu", "Initials": "JY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microelectronics of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yun-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Software Engineering Institute, Chengdu University of Information Technology Chengdu 610225, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ya-Qiang", "Initials": "YQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sichuan Institute for Translational Chinese Medicine, Sichuan Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Key Lab of Biological Evaluation of TCM Quality of the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine,Translational Chinese Medicine Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Engineering Technology Research Center of Genuine Regional Drug, Sichuan Provincial Engineering Research Center of Formation Principle and Quality Evaluation of Genuine Medicinal Materials Chengdu 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Yan", "ForeName": "Zhi-Xiang", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Key Laboratory of Drug Regulatory Science, National Medical Products Administration of China Beijing 100037, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jun-Ning", "Initials": "JN"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "English Abstract"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Computational Biology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Databases, Factual"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "36"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "35"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "3"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38812215", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20240125.101"]}}]}
