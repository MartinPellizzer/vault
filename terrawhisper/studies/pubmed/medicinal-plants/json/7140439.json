In gel filtration pattern, there seems no apparent difference among F2, F9 and F10. However, F1 component appears second sharp peak which given no biological activity. From results of cellulose acetate electrophoresis, it showed that majority of F1, F5, and F7 are anodal proteins, while only minor part of F2, F9, F10 and F12 possess this property. As to biological activities, higher potency for hemagglutination are obtained from F8(467%), F12(350%0, F9(280%) and F10(100%). On the other hand, fractions such as F10(90%), F2(87%), F8(86%) and F12(64%) reveal more capability of causing lymphocyte mitogenesis. For lymphocyte transformation, F10 lymphocyte transformation, F10(100%), F9(96%), F2(93%), F3(86%), F5(84%), F1(80%), F8(78%), and F12(70%) are predominance in their activity. In lymphocyte transformation test, F9 and F10 exhibit highest activity if their concentrations are lower than 20 micrograms/ml. But there have no significant difference among F1, F3 and F10 when the test concentrations are over 20 micrograms/ml. For patients of bladder carcinoma, the lymphocyte transformation pattern are resemblance to that of normal individuals. In summary, according to experimental data compared as above, the biological activities of F1, F2, F3, and F9 are similar with standard F10 (PHAP) and might applied in assay of cellular immunity and other cytogenetic studies."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chiang", "ForeName": "L C", "Initials": "LC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China (Republic : 1949- )", "MedlineTA": "Zhonghua Min Guo Wei Sheng Wu Ji Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8008067", "ISSNLinking": "0253-2662"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Affinity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Gel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophoresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocyte Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Phytohemagglutinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1982", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7140439"]}}]}
