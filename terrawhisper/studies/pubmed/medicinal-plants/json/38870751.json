The medicinal plant Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract (ULE) was widely used to control respiratory diseases in China. However, the regulatory mechanism of scientific evidence to support the therapeutic benefits of ULE in the management of COPD is greatly limited.", "This study aims to discover the potential protection mechanism of ULE on COPD via a muti-targets strategy.", "The present study set out to determine the potential protective effects of ULE on COPD through a multi-target strategy. In vivo and in vitro models of COPD were established using cigarette smoke and lipopolysaccharide to assess the protective effects of ULE. It was evaluated by measuring inflammatory cytokines and assessing pulmonary pathological changes. HPLC was used to verify the active compounds of the potential compounds that were collected and screened using HERB, works of literature, and ADME tools. The mechanisms of ULE in the treatment of COPD were explored using transcriptomics, connectivity-map, and network pharmacology approaches. The relevant targets were further investigated using RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The HCK inhibitor (iHCK-37) was used to evaluate the potential mechanism of ULE's active compounds in the prevention of COPD.", "ULE effectively protected the lungs of COPD mice from oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis damage. After screening and verification using ADME properties and HPLC, 4 active compounds were identified in ULE: liquiritin (LQ), licochalcone B (LCB), licochalcone A (LCA), and echinatin (ET). Network pharmacology integrated with transcriptomics analysis showed that ULE mitigated oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in COPD by suppressing HCK. The combination of LCB and LQ was optimized for anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-fibrosis activities. The iHCK-37 further validated the preventive treatment of LCB and LQ on COPD by inhibiting HCK to exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects. The combination of LCB and LQ, in a 1:1 ratio, exerted synergistic antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic effects in the treatment of COPD by downregulating HCK.", "The combination of LCB and LQ performed a significant anti-COPD effect via downregulating HCK."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier GmbH.
