Interleukin-6 (IL-6) activity in supernatants from the culture of macrophage cell line, RAW264.7 was dependent on increasing doses of GRN. The level of IL-6 induced with 500 micrograms/ml of GRN was comparable to that induced with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 10 micrograms/ml. Enhancement of the mRNA level of IL-6 by treatment with GRN was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of GRN on production of IL-6 was also observed using peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice which did not respond to endotoxins. This data suggested that the ability of GRN to activate IL-6 production of macrophages is not due to contamination of endotoxins in the preparation. Enhanced production of cytokine by GRN was observed not only with IL-6, but also with interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). In the production of TNF alpha, GRN was more effective than LPS used in this study. Other soluble or gel-forming(1-->3)-beta-D-glucans from various sources did not enhance the production of such cytokines although they are structurally similar to GRN. The above results indicate that GRN is a novel macrophage activator which augments cytokine production without dependence on endotoxins."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Immunopharmacology of Microbial Products, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Japan."}], "LastName": "Adachi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okazaki", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohno", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yadomae", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Biol Pharm Bull", "NlmUniqueID": "9311984", "ISSNLinking": "0918-6158"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-1"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "104074-36-4", "NameOfSubstance": "grifolan"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.7.49", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-1"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Macrophages, Peritoneal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred C3H"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Polymerase Chain Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "T-Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "beta-Glucans"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7537572", "10.1248/bpb.17.1554"]}}]}
