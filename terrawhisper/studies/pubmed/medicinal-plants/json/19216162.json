The chromatographic separation was performed on a Zorbax SB C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm) by gradient elution with phosphate buffer and acetonitrile at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL x min(-1), the column temperature was 35 degrees C, the reference electrode was ISAAC (in-situ silver/silver chloride), the working electrode was glassy carbon, the counter electrode was Pt, and the applied potential was + 800 mV. Concentration of adenosine was determined by HPLC-UV on an Diamonsil C18 column (4.6 mm x 250 mm, 5 microm) with water-acetonitrile (95:5) as mobile phase, the flow rate was 1.0 mL x min(-1), the column temperature was 40 degrees C and the detection wavelength was 260 nm. The content of cartharmin was detected using a spectrophotometric method.", "Twenty-one common chromatographic peaks were selected as characteristic peaks in the chromatogram of sample solution of Flos Cartnami. Seven peaks were identified as hydroxysafflor yellow A, 6-hydroxykaempferol-3-O-glucoside, rutin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, quercetin, kaempferol. The contents of hydroxysafflor yellow A and adenosine were from 0.35% to 3.58% and from 0.03% per hundred to 0.49% per hundred, respectively.", "The methods can be used to evaluate the quality of Flos Carthami."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Ruo-jing", "Initials": "RJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Bin", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "Mei-hong", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "146087-19-6", "NameOfSubstance": "hydroxysafflor yellow A"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5S5A2Q39HX", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "K72T3FS567", "NameOfSubstance": "Adenosine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Adenosine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chalcone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Quinones"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "2", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2009", "Month": "4", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["19216162"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
