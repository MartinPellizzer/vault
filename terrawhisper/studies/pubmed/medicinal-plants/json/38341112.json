However, the active components and mechanism of action against GUs remain unclear.", "The aim of this study was to explore the active components of WJW and elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in treating GUs.", "Initially, cell viability was measured by a cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay to evaluate the efficacy of WJW-containing serum in vitro. The gastric ulcer index, ulcer inhibition rate, hematoxylin and staining (H&E), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of WJW in vivo. Subsequently, the levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress factors were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) on in vitro and in vivo samples. Additionally, UPLC-Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap HRMS was used to analyze the components that were absorbed into the blood of WJW and its metabolites. Network pharmacology and metabolomics were subsequently used to identify the targets and pathways. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT\u2012qPCR) and Western blotting were used to verify the mRNA and protein levels of the key targets and pathways. Finally, the active components were identified by molecular docking to verify the binding stability of the components and key targets.", "WJW-containing serum ameliorated ethanol-induced damage in GES-1\u00a0cells and promoted cell healing. WJW-containing serum reduced IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MDA, and LDH levels while increasing IL-10, SOD, and T-AOC levels in the cells. Moreover, WJW treatment resulted in decreased IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and MDA levels and increased IL-10, SOD, PGE<sub>2,</sub> and NO levels in GUs rats. In addition, eight components of WJW were absorbed into the blood. The network pharmacology results revealed 192 common targets for blood entry components and GUs, and KEGG analysis revealed that apoptosis signaling pathways were the main pathways involved in WJW activity against GUs. Metabolomic screening was used to identify 13 differential metabolites. There were 23 common targets for blood entry components, GUs, and differential metabolites, with the key targets TNF (TNF-\u03b1), AKT1, PTGS2 (COX2) and MAPK1. WJW significantly inhibited the expression of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-3, TNF-\u03b1, COX2, and p-p44/42 MAPK while promoting the expression of Bcl-2 and p-AKT1. Molecular docking revealed that the active components of WJW for the treatment of GUs are berberine, palmatine, coptisine, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, evocarpine, and paeoniflorin.", "WJW treatment reduces inflammation and oxidative stress injury and inhibits apoptosis signaling pathways. The main active components are berberine, palmatine, coptisine, evodiamine, rutaecarpine, evocarpine, and paeoniflorin. In this paper, we provide a new strategy for exploring the active components of traditional Chinese medicine formulas for the treatment of diseases based on target mechanisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 The Authors.
