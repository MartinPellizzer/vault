Six previously undescribed indoleacetic acid glycosides, hazelnutins A-F (<b>1</b>-<b>6</b>), and five known compounds (<b>7</b>-<b>11</b>) were isolated from the hazelnut kernels. The structures of compounds <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> were successfully identified by high-resolution-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and NMR data, and their absolute configurations were established by electron-capture detector spectroscopy analyses in corporation with quantum chemical calculations. Furthermore, the absolute configurations of compounds <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> were unambiguously confirmed for the first time. Compounds <b>8</b>-<b>11</b> were discovered in hazelnut kernels for the first time. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> inhibited COX-2 expression with inhibition rates ranging from 36.10 to 64.08%. Compounds <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>8</b> could inhibit the proliferation of <i>Candida albicans</i>.
