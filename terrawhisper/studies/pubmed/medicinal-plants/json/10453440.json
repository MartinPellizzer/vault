In previous experiments, however, high doses of DADS were employed and only a limited range of tissues were examined. In the present studies, increased activities of QR and GT were recorded in the forestomach, glandular stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, liver, kidneys, spleen, heart, lungs, and urinary bladder of rats given DADS over a wide range of dose levels. Large variations in response were recorded among the different organs, with forestomach, duodenum, and jejunum being the most sensitive to enzyme induction by DADS. In these organs, significant increases in QR activity were observed at a dose of only 0.3 mg/kg/day. Such a dose level is close to that which may be achieved through human consumption of garlic, suggesting that induction of phase II enzymes may contribute to the protection that is afforded by this vegetable against cancer of the gastrointestinal tract in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Ruakura Agricultural Research Centre, Hamilton, New Zealand. mundayr@agresearch.cri.nz"}], "LastName": "Munday", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Munday", "ForeName": "C M", "Initials": "CM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Cancer", "NlmUniqueID": "7905040", "ISSNLinking": "0163-5581"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Disulfides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5HI47O6OA7", "NameOfSubstance": "diallyl disulfide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.6.5.2", "NameOfSubstance": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Allyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestive System"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Disulfides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Garlic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hematocrit"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "24"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10453440", "10.1207/S15327914NC340106"]}}]}
