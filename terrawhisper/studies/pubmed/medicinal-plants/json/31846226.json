IL-12 gene therapy is a useful technique to deliver an immune-modulatory gene directly into tumor site thereby limiting the adverse effects of systemic administration of IL-12 proteins. One of the most largely investigated non-viral gene carriers is polyamidoamine (PAMAM). In the current research, 5 and 3% of PAMAM primary amines were substituted to transmit the plasmid encoding IL-12 gene to cells by cholesteryl chloroformate and alkyl-PEG, respectively. The features of modified PAMAMs containing size and surface charge density, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency were investigated in colon cancer cells. in vitro experiment showed that this modified carrier with average size of about 160\u2009nm and zeta potential of 30\u2009mV was able to increase the level of IL-12 production up to two folds as compared to that of the unmodified PAMAM. Improvement of the polymer hydrophobic balance along with of the modulation of the surface positive charge could provide an efficient and safe non-viral IL-12 gene for colon cancer immunogene therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, North Carolina."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pishavar", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Advanced Sciences and Technologies, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Center, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Oroojalian", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ramezani", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-1549-4886"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nanotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashemi", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "941618", "Agency": "Mashhad University of Medical Sciences", "Country": "International"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dendrimers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Carriers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "PAMAM Starburst"}, {"RegistryNumber": "187348-17-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-12"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3WJQ0SDW1A", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyethylene Glycols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "97C5T2UQ7J", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholesterol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholesterol"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dendrimers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Carriers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Transfer Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HT29 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-12"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyethylene Glycols"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Smyth MJ, Taniguchi M, Street SE.
