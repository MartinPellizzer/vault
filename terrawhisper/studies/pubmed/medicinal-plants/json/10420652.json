The difference in pI (9.2 +/- 0.2 and 9.5 +/- 0.2, +/- SD; n = 3) allowed the separation of the two enzymes by free-flow isoelectrophoresis. Both were inhibited by cyclosporin A and thus belong to the cyclophilin family of PPIases. The enzymes differed slightly in their substrate specificity and their relative molecular masses of 18038 +/- 4 Da (D. lanataCyp18.0) and 18132 +/- 3 Da (D. lanataCyp18.1). Both cyclophilins were blocked N-terminally. Partial internal amino acid sequences from the two cyclophilins, with a length of 34 amino acids, displayed 82% sequence identity to each other. Pretreatment of PEMs with abscisic acid, sorbitol or a combination of both substances led to a 270 +/- 30% elevation of the total cytosolic cyclophilin concentration determined with a cyclophylin affinity sensor. During the first 4 d of pretreatment, the total PPIase activity was enhanced up to 230 +/- SD% compared with the control culture. The lag phase between maximal PPIase concentration after 4 d of pretreatment and maximal effect of freezing tolerance after 10 d of pretreatment indicated that increasing levels of cytosolic PPIases may be necessary to overcome the stress induced by hormones and osmotica during pretreatment but not to protect against freezing/thawing stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Max-Planck-Forschungsstelle Enzymologie der Proteinfaltung, Halle/Saale, Germany. kuellertz@enzyme-halle.mpg.de"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "K\u00fcllertz", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liebau", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "R\u00fccknagel", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schierhorn", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Diettrich", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fischer", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Luckner", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta", "NlmUniqueID": "1250576", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0935"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.2.1.8", "NameOfSubstance": "Peptidylprolyl Isomerase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adaptation, Physiological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "metabolism", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Freezing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Peptidylprolyl Isomerase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Substrate Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "7", "Day": "27", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10420652", "10.1007/s004250050598", "10.1007/s004250050598"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
