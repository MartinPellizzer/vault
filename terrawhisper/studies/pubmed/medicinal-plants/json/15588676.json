Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 midwives in seven rural communities near La Ceiba, Honduras, regarding the plants they employ during the birthing process as well as their associated beliefs. Seventy-nine different plant species used to treat 15 conditions occurring during the pregnancy, birth and postpartum stages were recorded. Most plants and uses were reported by only one or two midwives, reflecting the fact that most midwives in this region had immigrated from different parts of the country. Almost all the midwives used or knew of plant remedies for treatment of miscarriages, postpartum abdominal pain and hemorrhages, retained placenta, and for speeding up contractions during labor. The most frequently cited plants as well as those for which there was greatest consensus tended to be widespread cultivated or weedy species. Although use of medicinal plants by midwives has decreased as a result of retraining programs by government health centers, midwives' knowledge of medicinal plants may provide an important resource for improving maternal-infant health in Honduras and elsewhere. Suggestions for future ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies on this topic are provided."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Hawaii at Manoa, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA. ticktin@hawaii.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ticktin", "ForeName": "Tamara", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Dalle", "ForeName": "Sarah Paule", "Initials": "SP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertility Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Delivery, Obstetric"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Utilization"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Honduras"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant, Newborn"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Midwifery"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Postnatal Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Postpartum Period"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rural Population"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "8", "Day": "15"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "8", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "9", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15588676", "10.1016/j.jep.2004.09.015", "S0378-8741(04)00446-5"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
