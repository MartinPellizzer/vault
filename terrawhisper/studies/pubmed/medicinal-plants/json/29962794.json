It causes different side effects such as nephrotoxicity because of increasing oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species production. This study was designed to investigate the effect of <i>Rheum turkestanicum</i> on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rat.", "Animals were randomly divided into four groups (six each). Group I received normal saline (1mL/day, intraperitoneally [i.p.]). Group II received a single dose of cisplatin (8mg/kg, i.p.). Groups III and IV received extract at doses of 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg, i.p., respectively, for 3 consecutive days, 1h before a single dose of cisplatin only at the first day. Blood samples were taken for measuring the level of urea and creatinine. Furthermore, 24-h urinary factors such as glucose and protein were measured. Histopathological observation was carried out on kidney sections. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey-Kramer <i>post hoc</i> test for multiple comparisons.", "Cisplatin increased the lipid peroxidation, serum creatinine, serum urea, urinary glucose, and urinary protein, whereas decreased the content of thiol in kidney. The extract reduced serum creatinine, serum urea, urinary glucose, urinary protein, lipid peroxidation, and increased thiol following cisplatin administration. Histological studies revealed lower lesions in kidney in the extract-treated groups compared to cisplatin-treated one.", "This research showed the extract has protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. This observation may be related to antioxidant properties of the extract."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fanoudi", "ForeName": "Sahar", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Medicine, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mollazadeh", "ForeName": "Hamid", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Aghaei", "ForeName": "Azita", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Boroushaki", "ForeName": "Mohammad Taher", "Initials": "MT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Bioallied Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101537209", "ISSNLinking": "0975-7406"}, "CoiStatement": "There are no conflicts of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Rabik CA, Dolan ME.
