The investigations of the chemical composition and immunological properties show that their activity is mainly due to the alkaloid constituents. In the present study the anti-inflammatory properties of total ethanol extract (TEE), three alkaloid fractions, a major alkaloid berberine and oxyacanthine isolated from Berberis vulgaris roots were compared. All these were applied in acute inflammation (carrageenan- and zymosan-induced paw oedema), as the TEE showed the highest reducing effect. Their ability to alter in vivo and in vitro complement activity was determined. Also, the TEE was most effective in a chronic inflammatory model of adjuvant arthritis. The protoberberine fractions Bv2, Bv3 and berberine suppressed a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. Fraction Bv1 and berberine diminished antibody response against SRBC in vivo. The in vitro treatment of splenocytes with berberine showed that the anti-SRBC antibody synthesis was influenced in a different manner depending on the time course of its application. Oxyacanthine was less effective than berberine in the tests used."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Microbiology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria."}], "LastName": "Ivanovska", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Philipov", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Int J Immunopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7904799", "ISSNLinking": "0192-0561"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoquinolines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0I8Y3P32UF", "NameOfSubstance": "Berberine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5BD0KNF4AT", "NameOfSubstance": "oxyacanthine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibody Formation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Arthritis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Berberine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Complement Activation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Hypersensitivity, Delayed"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoquinolines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1996", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9080249", "10.1016/s0192-0561(96)00047-1", "S0192056196000471"]}}]}
