Although there are several studies reported the positive impact of laser light on crop plants, no studies have applied laser light to enhance the nutritive values of buckwheat sprouts. Herein, the contents of health-promoting minerals, metabolites and enzymes as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined in laser-treated (He-Ne laser, 632\u00a0nm, 5\u00a0mW) common buckwheat (CBW) and tartarybuckwheat (TBW) sprouts. Out of 49 targeted minerals, vitamins, pigments and antioxidants, more than 35 parameters were significantly increased in CBW and/or TBW sprouts by laser light treatment. Also, laser light boosted the antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory activities through inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase activities, particularly in TBW sprouts. Accordingly, laser light could be recommended as a promising method to improve the nutritional and health-promoting values of buckwheat sprouts."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
