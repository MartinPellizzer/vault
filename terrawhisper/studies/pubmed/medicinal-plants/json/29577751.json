Those compounds were isolated and purified by various column chromatographic methods and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic (1D, 2D NMR, and HR-MS) chemical analyses. All compounds were isolated for the first time from E. alatavica Boiss, and biochemical pathway of the new compound has been hypothesized. Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for antioxidant properties based on the DPPH radical scavenging activities. Results showed that IC<sub>50</sub> values of compounds 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were 25.69, 1.88, 2.87, 11.55 and 17.81\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively, as compared to the control ascorbic acid (5.34\u00a0\u03bcg/mL)."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , Beijing , China."}], "LastName": "Rozimamat", "ForeName": "Rushangul", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi , China."}], "LastName": "Kehrimen", "ForeName": "Nurmuhammat", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4652-6879"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Key Laboratory of Plant Resources and Chemistry of Arid Zone, Xinjiang Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c State Key Laboratory Basis of Xinjiang Indigenous Medicinal Plants Resource Utilization, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences , Urumqi , China."}], "LastName": "Aisa", "ForeName": "Haji Akber", "Initials": "HA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Triterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Structure-Activity Relationship"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Triterpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29577751", "10.1080/14786419.2018.1455039"]}}]}
