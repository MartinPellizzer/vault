In the first group both mothers and neonates received cotoneaster; in the second group only mothers; in the third group only neonates; and in the fourth group the neonates received distilled water as placebo. Phototherapy was done under the same condition for all neonates.", "The reduction of bilirubin was significantly higher in treatment groups compared to control group (p<0.05). Bilirubin in the group of neonates whose mothers consumed cotoneaster was less compared to control group at 24 and 36 hours (p<0.05) and the highest reduction in bilirubin was observed in the first group. The mean duration of hospitalization was longer for the control group (p<0.05).", "Consumption of cotoneaster by both mothers and neonates caused a decrease in neonatal jaundice more rapidly compared to other groups and decreased the duration of hospitalization.
