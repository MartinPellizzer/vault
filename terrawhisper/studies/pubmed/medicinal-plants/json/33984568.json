The effects of different concentrations (2%-10% w/v), temperatures (25-80\u00a0\u00b0C), pH (3.0-9.0), freeze-thaw conditions (thawed at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C), co-salts (KCl and CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and co-sugars (sucrose, fructose and mannose) on the rheological properties were investigated. Generally, higher concentrations, neutral pH, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sugars increased the viscosity of DOM, while increasing temperature (25-65\u00a0\u00b0C) had opposite effects. The results suggested that cross-linked networks exist in DOM, and viscosity changes may be related to the ionisation of carboxyl groups, structural changes and enhancement/reduction of molecular interactions. Particularly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> could interact with uronic acids of two or more polysaccharide molecules, modify the network-structure through cross-linking with carboxyl groups, and enhance the stronger carboxylate-cation<sup>2+</sup>-carboxylate interactions. Therefore, DOM is suitable for food applications as thickening or gelling agents in aqueous solutions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
