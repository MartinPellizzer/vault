There are more than 200 active ingredients in this resin including acetyl-11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (AKBA). We proposed that AKBA can improve memory impairment induced by cerebral inflammation following the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Forty male rats were grouped and received the following treatments: Control (diluted DMSO\u00a0+\u00a0saline), LPS (diluted DMSO\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0mg/kg LPS), LPS- AKBA 5 and LPS- AKBA 10 (5 or 10\u00a0mg/ kg AKBA before LPS). Morris water maze (MWM), passive avoidance (PA) and biochemical tests were carried out. Pre-treatment with both doses of AKBA improved memory performance in MWM and PA tests (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 to P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Pre-treatment by AKBA improved the levels of hippocampal IL-10 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), BDNF (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), CAT (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), SOD P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and thiols (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) while reduced IL-6 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), TNF-\u03b1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), NO (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), GFAP (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and MDA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) levels. AKBA effectively ameliorated LPS-induced learning and memory impairments and improved BDNF in a neuroinflammation animal model. The effects seem to be due to setting a positive balance between pro-inflammatory to inflammatory cytokines and reinvigorate the antioxidant system."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
