Using a 3-dimensional similarity model of this enzyme, a series of novel phosphonates (1-5) was designed as potential inhibitors. Phosphonates 1-5 were synthesized in good yield by reaction of the corresponding cinnamaldehydes with tetraethylmethylene diphosphonate. Monophosphonic acids 6 and 7 were obtained by basic hydrolysis of the corresponding phosphonates while phosphonamidate 8 was synthesized by reacting benzylamine with the iminium salt intermediate of the monophosphonic acid. Using recombinant cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD, EC 1.1.1.195) the inhibitory activity of these compounds was evaluated and compared with that of the carbonyl analogues. Inhibition kinetic studies showed compounds 2 and 3 to be mixed type linear inhibitors while compound 4 was uncompetitive. 1H NMR studies of inhibitor 2, for which Ki and Ki' were 20 and 86 microM, respectively, in the presence of CAD based on selective line-broadening showed an increased interaction of the 3-OMe group of the aromatic ring of the inhibitor with the active site of the CAD. A transferred nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (TRNOESY) experiment for inhibitor 2 with CAD was used to determine the conformation of this compound bound to CAD. These results were found to be consistent with the 3-dimensional structural model of the enzyme."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paul-Sabatier, ESA CNRS 5068, Toulouse, France."}], "LastName": "Kennedy", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Baltas", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Douglas", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Duran", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Embrey", "ForeName": "K J", "Initials": "KJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Giraudon", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "McKie", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Grima-Pettenati", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gorrichon", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Switzerland", "MedlineTA": "J Enzyme Inhib", "NlmUniqueID": "8709734", "ISSNLinking": "1026-5457"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Organophosphonates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Propanols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vinyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-53-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Lignin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.195", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SS8YOP444F", "NameOfSubstance": "cinnamyl alcohol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alcohol Oxidoreductases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Design"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Eucalyptus"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Lignin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Conformation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Organophosphonates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Propanols"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vinyl Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "8", "Day": "13", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10445045", "10.3109/14756369909030318"]}}]}
