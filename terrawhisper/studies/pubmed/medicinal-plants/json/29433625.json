Among different methods, tissue culture is the best way with high efficiency that is useful for studying stress tolerance mechanisms to obtain drought tolerance of stevia. For this purpose, different concentrations of mannitol (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mg/l) were used as various treatments in the culture medium of stevia. According to the results, the highest level of UGT85C2 gene expression (1.181 Total lab unit) was seen in plants grown under 30 mg/l mannitol treatment and the lowest level of this gene expression (0.603 Total lab unit) was observed under 40 mg/l mannitol treatment. However, the highest level of KO gene expression (1.323 Total lab unit) was observed under 20 mg/l mannitol. It shows stevia growth is affected by osmotic stress. Water deficiency has a negative impact on Stevia. However, the expression of genes had increased by particular mannitol concentrations. Actually, stevia can survive under various abiotic stresses."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hashempoor", "ForeName": "Somaye", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Biology Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaheri", "ForeName": "Matin", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Fertility and Infertility Research Center, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kahrizi", "ForeName": "Danial", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medicinal Plants, Institute of Higher Education, Jahad-e-Daneshgahi, Kermanshah Unit, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kazemi", "ForeName": "Nastaran", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Cardiology, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Muhammadi", "ForeName": "Saare", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agronomy and Plant Breeding, Kermanshah Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Safavi", "ForeName": "Seyed Mehdi", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagros Bioidea Company, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Tayebeh", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Sexual Medicine; and The Rhazes Center for Research in Family Health and Sexual Medicine, Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rahmanian", "ForeName": "Elham", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Zagros Bioidea Company, Kermanshah, Iran."}], "LastName": "Heshmatpanaah", "ForeName": "Malihe", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3OWL53L36A", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannitol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Droughts"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mannitol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Osmotic Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Stevia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water Supply"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "28"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29433625", "10.14715/cmb/2018.64.2.6"]}}]}
