Here, we aim to explore the effect of EPSs from an endophyte Glutamicibacter halophytocota KLBMP 5180 on tomato seeds germination and seedlings growth under salt stress. Our study revealed that 2.0\u00a0g/L EPSs resulted in increased seed germination rate by 23.5\u00a0% and 11.0\u00a0%, respectively, under 0 and 200\u00a0mM NaCl stress conditions. Further pot experiment demonstrated that EPSs significantly promoted seedlings growth under salt stress, with increased height, root length and fibrous roots number. Plant physiological traits revealed that EPSs increased chlorophyll content, enhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes, soluble sugar, and K<sup>+</sup> concentration in seedlings; malondialdehyde and Na<sup>+</sup> contents were reduced. Additionally, auxin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid were accumulated significantly in seedlings after EPSs treatment. Furthermore, we identified 1233 differentially expressed genes, and they were significantly enriched in phytohormone signal transmission, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and protein processing in endogenous reticulum pathways, etc. Our results suggest that KLBMP 5180-produced EPSs effectively ameliorated NaCl stress in tomato plants by triggering complex regulation mechanism, and showed application potentiality in agriculture."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
