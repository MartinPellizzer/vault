Administration of Pinus halepensis L. (Pinaceae family) in previous studies was found to alleviate deleterious effects of aspirin-induced damage on liver and kidney. The present study, carried out on female rats, evaluates the effects of P. halepensis L. essential oil (EOP) on aspirin (A)-induced damage to liver and kidney. The animals used in this study were rats (n=28) divided into 4 groups of 7 each: (1) a control group (C); (2) a group given NaCl for 56 days then treated with (A) (600 mg/kg) for 4 days (A); (3) a group fed with (EOP) for 56 days then (A) for 4 days; and a group fed with only (EOP) for 56 days and given NaCl for 4 days. Estimations of biochemical parameters in blood were determined using kit methods (Spinreact). Lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were determined. Histopathological study was done by immersing pieces of both organs in a fixative solution followed by paraffin embeddeding and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Under our experimental conditions, Aspirin at dose 600 mg/kg body weight induced an increase of serum biochemical parameters as well as an oxidative stress in both organs. An increase occurred in TBARS by 108% and 55%, a decrease in SOD by 78% and 53%, CAT by 53% and 78%, and GPx by 78% and 51% in liver and kidney, respectively, compared to control. Administration of EOP given to rats enabled correction in these parameters. It could be concluded that the treatment with P. halepensis L. essential oil inhibited aspirin-induced liver and kidney damage."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Environmental Physiopathology, Valorization of Bioactive Molecules and Mathematical Modeling, Faculty of Sciences of Sfax."}], "LastName": "Bouzenna", "ForeName": "Hafsia", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Samout", "ForeName": "Noura", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Amani", "ForeName": "Etaya", "Initials": "E"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mbarki", "ForeName": "Sakhria", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tlili", "ForeName": "Zied", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rjeibi", "ForeName": "Ilhem", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Elfeki", "ForeName": "Abdelfattah", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Talarmin", "ForeName": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hfaiedh", "ForeName": "Najla", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "J Oleo Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "101175339", "ISSNLinking": "1345-8957"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "R16CO5Y76E", "NameOfSubstance": "Aspirin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Albinism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Aspirin"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pinus"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27430382", "10.5650/jos.ess15287"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
