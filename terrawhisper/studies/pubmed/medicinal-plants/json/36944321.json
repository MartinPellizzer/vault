This study investigated potential virulence, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, solvent adhesion, and biofilm-forming capabilities of six cellulolytic bacteria isolated from soil samples: Paenarthrobacter sp. MKAL1, Hymenobacter sp. MKAL2, Mycobacterium sp. MKAL3, Stenotrophomonas sp. MKAL4, Chryseobacterium sp. MKAL5, and Bacillus sp. MKAL6. Strains were subjected to phenotypic methods, including heavy metal and antibiotic susceptibility and virulence factors (protease, lipase, capsule production, autoaggregation, hydrophobicity, and biofilm formation). The effect of ciprofloxacin was also investigated on bacterial susceptibility over time, cell membrane, and biofilm formation. Strains MKAL2, MKAL5, and MKAL6 exhibited protease and lipase activities, while only MKAL6 produced capsules. All strains were capable of aggregating, forming biofilm, and adhering to solvents. Strains tolerated high amounts of chromium, lead, zinc, nickel, and manganese and were resistant to lincomycin. Ciprofloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity against these strains. Although the phenotypic evaluation of virulence factors of bacteria can indicate their pathogenic nature, an in-depth genetic study of virulence, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes is required."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).
