We should not ignore the significance of natural medicine. The Chinese have been perfecting medicinal therapy based on the raw ingredients of plants/herbs and their derivatives for thousands of years. Chinese practitioners of traditional medicine prescribe medicines based on yin and yang. Traditional medicine is communicated in a verb or written form. Natural resources used in traditional medicine to treat diseases are not limited to just medicinal plants but also include animals, shell fish, and minerals. Parts of plants used in traditional medicine are leaves, stems, flowers, bark, and root. Chinese medicine is the world's oldest continuous surviving tradition. The Chinese experimented with local plants, often resulting in mild to violent reactions. This process allowed them to become familiar with poisonous plants and those that could relieve pain or successfully treat illness. Current allopathic medicines are composed of synthetic compounds copied from natural chemical derivatives, which tend to be more potent than the original compound. Some medicinal plants used to effect conception/contraception include Striga astiatica (contraceptive); Eurycoma longifolia (male virility); and a mixture of lengkuas, mengkudu masak, black pepper seeds, ginger, salt, and 2 eggs (increase libido). Women in Malaysia take jamu to preserve their body shape and to provide nutrition during pregnancy. Praneem causes local cell-mediated immunity in the uterus. Clinical trials of Praneem with or without the hCG vaccine are planned."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["097874", "00232420"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: ADVANCES IN CONTRACEPTIVE DELIVERY SYSTEMS"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "China", "Contraception", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Eastern Asia", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Services", "Infertility", "Malaysia", "Medicine", "Medicine, Traditional", "Plants, Medicinal", "Reproduction", "Southeastern Asia"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12287843", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1995", "Month": "01", "Day": "04"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "07"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "1012-8689", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "10", "Issue": "3-4", "PubDate": {"Year": "1994"}}, "Title": "Advances in contraceptive delivery systems : CDS", "ISOAbbreviation": "Adv Contracept Deliv Syst"}, "ArticleTitle": "Medicinal plants: conception / contraception.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "355", "EndPage": "363", "MedlinePgn": "355-63"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chaing", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Merino-chavez", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "L L", "Initials": "LL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "F N", "Initials": "FN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hafez", "ForeName": "E S", "Initials": "ES"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Adv Contracept Deliv Syst", "NlmUniqueID": "8602181", "ISSNLinking": "1012-8689"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Southeastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Malaysia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproduction"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12287843"]}}]}
