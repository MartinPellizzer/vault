The bioaccumulation of these elements in plants might enhance medium- and long-term adverse health risk promoting genetic alterations that lead to dermal, gastrointestinal, circulatory, renal, and brain disorders. The present study aimed to determine the bioaccumulation potential and cytogenotoxic effect of <i>Equisetum hyemale</i> extracts. <i>E. hyemale</i> seedlings were divided into two groups: exposed group (plants cultivated in soil with heavy metals solution) and control (plants cultivated in soil with distilled water). Heavy metals were quantified in the cultivation soils (control and exposed) and extracts (ethanolic and infusion) of vegetative parts from <i>E. hyemale</i> cultivated in both soils. Root length and cytogenotoxic effect were determined utilizing <i>Allium</i> cepa bioassay. Data demonstrated that <i>Equisetum hyemale</i> present the ability to absorb and bioaccumulate different heavy metals including lead, copper, cobalt manganese, zinc, iron and chromium. Given this property <i>E. hyemale</i> may be considered a reliable bioindicator to assess cytogenotoxicity of certain substances that exert adverse risks to environment and human and animal health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), School of Sciences, Humanities and Languages, Department of Biotechnology, Laboratory of Phytotherapic and Natural Products, Assis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Silva", "ForeName": "Regildo M\u00e1rcio Gon\u00e7alves da", "Initials": "RMGD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Marques de Oliveira Moraes", "ForeName": "Vanessa", "Initials": "V"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Pouso Alegre - UNIS - Group Pouso Alegre, Minas Gerais, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Marinho Dos Santos", "ForeName": "Valter Henrique", "Initials": "VH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Oliveira Granero", "ForeName": "Filipe", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "S\u00e3o Paulo State University (UNESP), Institute of Chemistry, Araraquara, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Malaguti Figueiredo", "ForeName": "C\u00e9lia Cristina", "Initials": "CC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Educacional do Munic\u00edpio de Assis (FEMA), Assis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil."}], "LastName": "Pereira Silva", "ForeName": "Luciana", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Toxicol Environ Health A", "NlmUniqueID": "100960995", "ISSNLinking": "0098-4108"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Soil"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Soil Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity", "analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Soil"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "28", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36303438", "10.1080/15287394.2022.2139313"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
