The objective of this study was to determine if normal root cap development and early plant gravity responses were dependent on gravitational cues. Seedlings were germinated in space and chemically fixed in orbit after 21, 40, and 72 h. Seedlings 96 h old were returned viable to earth. Germination and total seedling length were not dependent on gravity treatment. In space-flown seedlings, the number of cell stories in the root cap and the geometry of central columella cells did not differ from those of the Earth-grown seedlings. The root cap structure of clinorotated plants appeared similar to that of seedlings from microgravity, with the exception of three-day rotated plants, which displayed significant cellular damage in the columella region. Nuclear polarity did not depend on gravity; however, the positions of amyloplasts in the central columella cells were dependent on both the gravity treatment and the age of the seedlings. Seedlings from space, returned viable to earth, responded to horizontal stimulation as did 1 g controls, but seedlings rotated on the clinostat for the same duration had a reduced curvature response. This study demonstrates that initial root cap development is insensitive to either chronic clinorotation or microgravity. Soon after differentiation, however, clinorotation leads to loss of normal root cap structure and plant graviresponse while microgravity does not."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Space Life Sciences Research Branch, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Smith", "ForeName": "J D", "Initials": "JD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Staehelin", "ForeName": "L A", "Initials": "LA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Todd", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "J Plant Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9882059", "ISSNLinking": "0176-1617"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Germination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gravitation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravitropism"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Gravity Sensing"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "physiology", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Root Cap"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plastids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rotation"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Space Flight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weightlessness"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "11", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11543182", "10.1016/s0176-1617(99)80052-2", "S0176-1617(99)80052-2"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
