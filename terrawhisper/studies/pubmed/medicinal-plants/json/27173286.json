The four DNA fragments from three high-GC primers (FY-27, FY-28, and FY-29) were successfully cloned into a pGM-T vector. The positive clones were sequenced; their names, sizes, and GenBank numbers were JYHGC1-1, 345 bp, KJ620024; YJHGC2-1, 388 bp, KJ620025; JYHGC7-2, 1036 bp, KJ620026; and JYHGC6-2, 715 bp, KJ620027, respectively. Four novel SCAR markers were developed by designing specific primers, optimizing conditions, and PCR validation. The developed SCAR markers were used for the genetic authentication of L. japonica from its substitutes. This technique provides another means of developing DNA markers for the characterization and authentication of various organisms including medicinal plants and their substitutes."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Cheng", "ForeName": "J L", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital of Zigong, Zigong, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Qiu", "ForeName": "Y M", "Initials": "YM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."}], "LastName": "Wei", "ForeName": "C L", "Initials": "CL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "L Q", "Initials": "LQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Epigenetics and Oncology, The Research Center for Preclinical Medicine, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Judicial Authentication Center, Sichuan Medical University, Luzhou City, Sichuan, China."}], "LastName": "Fu", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Brazil", "MedlineTA": "Genet Mol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101169387", "ISSNLinking": "1676-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Primers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Genetic Markers"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Primers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "GC Rich Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Markers"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lonicera"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["27173286", "10.4238/gmr.15027737", "gmr7737"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
