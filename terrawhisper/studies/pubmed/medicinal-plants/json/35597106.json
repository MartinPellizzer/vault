Target of Rapamycin (TOR) is a diversified Serine/Threonine protein kinase existing in all eukaryotes that regulates distinct salient growth and developmental signaling pathways. TOR signaling acts as a central hub in plants that allows a variety of nutrients, energy, hormones, and environmental stimuli to be integrated. TOR is activated by several nutrients and promotes energy-consuming processes such as cell division, protein translation, mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis. We summarized the recent findings on the TOR function in regulating the dynamic networks of nutrients, including sugar, sulfur, nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus, potassium, and amino acids. TOR's role in abiotic stress was discussed, in which TOR orchestrating stress signaling, including heat, cold, salt, and osmotic stress, to regulate transcriptional and metabolic reprogramming, as well as growth and development. The interconnections between TOR and SnRK1 kinase were discussed in controlling nutrient deprivation and abiotic stress."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
