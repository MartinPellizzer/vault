In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).\u00a0 <b>Methods</b>: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. <b>Results</b>: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. <b>Conclusion</b>: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright: \u00a9 2022 Akeel Al-Hussaniy H et al."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Anesthetic, Alnukbah University, Baghdad, Iraq."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Akeel Al-Hussaniy", "ForeName": "Hany", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy and Medicinal Plants, College of Pharmacy, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "LastName": "S Al-Tameemi", "ForeName": "Zahraa", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq."}], "LastName": "Al-Zobaidy", "ForeName": "Mohammed J", "Initials": "MJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "F1000Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101594320", "ISSNLinking": "2046-1402"}, "CoiStatement": "No competing interests were disclosed."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Abood RA, Abdahmed KA, Mazyed SS: Epidemiology of different types of cancers reported in Basra, Iraq.
