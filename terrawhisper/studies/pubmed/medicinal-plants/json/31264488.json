The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute and sub-acute toxicity of hydroalcoholic extract of <i>R. turkestanicum</i> root. In acute toxicity experiment, female and male mice (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20095/group/sex) were orally administrated with the extract at single doses of 300, 2000 and 3000\u2009mg/kg and observed for 14\u2009days. In the sub-acute study, the extract was orally administered daily at doses of 100 and 400\u2009mg/kg to male rats (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20098) for 4\u2009weeks. During the acute toxicity test, there were no deaths or any signs of toxicity observed after administration of the <i>R. turkestanicum</i> extract at 300\u2009mg/kg, which was the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL). The extract at a dose of 3000\u2009mg/kg led to the death of one female and one male mouse (LD<sub>50</sub> > 3000\u2009mg/kg). In sub-acute toxicity experiment, the extract induced no mortality or significant changes in body weight, general behaviors, hematological parameters, serum biochemical factors (related to the kidney and liver function), and histopathology of the heart, liver, kidney, and brain up to the highest dose tested of 400\u2009mg/kg (NOAEL). High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, alkanes, and anthraquinones in the extract. In conclusion, short-term use of <i>R. turkestanicum</i> root does not appear to produce significant toxicity up to a dose of 400\u2009mg/kg."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedical Sciences, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jahani Yazdi", "ForeName": "Amirali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Dentistry, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Javanshir", "ForeName": "Sajad", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Medicine, Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soukhtanloo", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, School of Dentistry, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jalili-Nik", "ForeName": "Mohammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cancer Molecular Pathology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafarian", "ForeName": "Amir Hossein", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Iranshahi", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Biotechnology Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hasanpour", "ForeName": "Maede", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Samen Hojaj, Department of Chemistry, Mashhad Branch Technical and Vocational University (TVU), Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khatami", "ForeName": "Seyed-Mola", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Azar", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Payame Noor University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amiri", "ForeName": "Mohammad Sadegh", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Drug Chem Toxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "7801723", "ISSNLinking": "0148-0545"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lethal Dose 50"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Rheum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Assessment"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Acute"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Toxicity Tests, Subacute"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31264488", "10.1080/01480545.2018.1561713"]}}]}
