Clinical diagnosis in poisoned humans may be difficult if no evidence of previous fruit ingestion is available. We present our experience in the clinical diagnosis of Karwinskia humboldtiana polyneuropathy, as confirmed by toxin detection in blood. We designed an open trial at the Pediatric Neurology service and included all cases with acute ascending paralysis that were admitted to our hospital in the last two years. In all cases, we performed hematological, immunological and biochemical profiles, CSF analysis including immunological studies, oligoclonal bands and myelin basic protein determinations. Electrodiagnostic studies were performed, including motor conduction velocities, distal latencies, F-wave latency and compound muscle action potential (CAMP) amplitude. The presence of Karwinskia humboldtiana toxins in blood were determined by thin layer chromatography. In six cases, T-514 Karwinskia humboldtiana toxin was detected. These cases had a symmetric motor polyneuropathy with the absence of tendon reflexes and no sensory signs or cranial nerve involvement. Only one patient required assisted ventilation due to bulbar paralysis. In two of these cases, a sural nerve biopsy revealed a segmental demyelination with swelling and phagocytic chambers in Schwann cells and without lymphocytic infiltration. All six cases survived, with complete recovery in five. We conclude that this intoxication is common in Mexico. The availability of toxin detection in blood samples allows the clinician to establish an accurate diagnosis and should be included in the study of children with polyradiculoneuropathy, especially in countries where this poisonous plant grows."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurology Service, School of Medicine and Hospital Universitario UANL, Monterrey, N.L., Mexico."}], "LastName": "Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bermudez", "ForeName": "M V", "Initials": "MV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rangel-Guerra", "ForeName": "R A", "Initials": "RA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "de Leon Flores", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Neurol Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0375403", "ISSNLinking": "0022-510X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Child, Preschool"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Electrophysiology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mexico"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Muscle Hypotonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Myelin Sheath"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurologic Examination"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "cerebrospinal fluid", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Paralysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "complications", "diagnosis", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "diagnosis", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Polyradiculoneuropathy"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Rhamnus"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Sural Nerve"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "5", "Day": "23", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9543321", "10.1016/s0022-510x(97)00212-8", "S0022510X97002128"]}}]}
