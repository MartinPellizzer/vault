In this report, we investigated the effect of costunolide on cellular differentiation in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell culture system. Costunolide markedly increased the degree of HL-60 leukemia cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with 5nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)). Costunolide by itself had very weak effects on the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Cytofluorometric analysis and cell morphologic studies indicated that costunolide potentiated 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced cell differentiation predominantly into monocytes. Inhibitors for PKC, PI3-K, and ERK markedly inhibited HL-60 cell differentiation induced by costunolide in combination with 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). In addition, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with costunolide before the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) addition also potentiated cell differentiation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, and the enhanced levels of cell differentiation closely correlated with the inhibitory levels of NF-kappaB-binding activity by costunolide. These results indicate that PKC, PI3-K, ERK and NF-kappaB may be involved in 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-mediated cell differentiation enhanced by costunolide."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunology Laboratory, College of Pharmacy and Research Institute of Drug Development, Chonnam National University, Kwangju, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Seung H", "Initials": "SH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "So N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyeoung J", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Tae S", "Initials": "TS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium Channel Agonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4IK578SA7Z", "NameOfSubstance": "costunolide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.13", "NameOfSubstance": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.24", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "FXC9231JVH", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcitriol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcitriol"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium Channel Agonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Synergism"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HL-60 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukemia, Myeloid"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Monocytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Protein Kinase C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Cells, Cultured"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "17", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "18", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12234604", "10.1016/s0006-2952(02)01292-3", "S0006295202012923"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
