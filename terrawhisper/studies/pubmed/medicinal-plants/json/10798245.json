During steaming, the color of ginseng (white) turned yellow and brown during subsequent steaming. Color is an important index for grading red Asian ginseng. In this study, the effects of drying time and temperature on the surface color formation (L, a/b) of the Asian ginseng, and the color formation (L, a/b) of the red Asian ginseng powder were investigated. The value of L decreased, while the value of a/b increased as drying proceeded; the value of L was slightly influenced by the drying temperature, but the value of a/b was markedly influenced. With respect to the color of the final product (red ginseng), the value of L was slightly influenced by steaming time and temperature, while the value of a/b was increased as steaming time and drying temperature increased. Based on the nth-order rate equation and Arrhenius equation, a kinetic model for describing these effects was established, and the results were satisfactorily fitting."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, University of Hong Kong, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ren", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "X W", "Initials": "XW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Pharmazie", "NlmUniqueID": "9800766", "ISSNLinking": "0031-7144"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indicators and Reagents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Color"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indicators and Reagents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Kinetics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Maillard Reaction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Models, Chemical"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10798245"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
