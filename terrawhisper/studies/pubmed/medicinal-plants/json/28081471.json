The purpose of this study was to determine the in situ cytotoxicity effect P. macrocarpa fruit ethyl acetate fraction (PMEAF) by using various conventional and modern microscopy techniques. The cytotoxicity of PMEAF treated MDA-MB-231 cells was determined through the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay and CyQuant Cell Proliferation Assay after 24h of treatment. Both results were indicated that the PMEAF is a potential anticancer agent with the average IC<sub>50</sub> values of 18.10\u03bcg/mL by inhibiting the MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation. Various conventional and modern microscopy techniques such as light microscopy, holographic microscopy, transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscope were used for the observation of morphological changes in PMEAF treated MDA-MB-231cells for 24h. The characteristic of apoptotic cell death includes cell shrinkage, membrane blebs, chromatin condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies were observed. PMEAF might be the best candidate for developing more potent anticancer drugs or chemo-preventive supplements."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.
