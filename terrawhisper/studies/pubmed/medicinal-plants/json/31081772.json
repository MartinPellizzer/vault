The objectives of the current study are: first, to investigate the effects of Monotheca buxifolia and Bosea amherstiana on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes and second, to determine its effect on oxidative enzymes. Cells were treated at concentration of 100\u03bcg/mL with both plants. Alkaline Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis/comet assay were used for DNA damage analysis. Activities of antioxidant enzymes TBARS, SOD, CAT and POD were assayed on treatment with the extracts. Both plants species possess the protective role against H2O2-induced lymphocytes DNA. Dichloromethane (DCM) fraction of Monotheca buxifolia (H DNA 94.79\u00b10.29%) and methanolic fraction of Bosea amherstiana (H DNA 93.63\u00b12.23%) possess high protection Significantly decrease occur in status of antioxidant enzymes. This study indicates that both plants have potential in preventing oxidative damages/stress related diseases and would be suitably used as supplements in combination with conventional drug for the treatment of cancer like diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Biotechnology and Microbiology, University of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hassan", "ForeName": "Said", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Biotechnology and Microbiology, University of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Bashir", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shaheed Benazir Bhutto University Shiringal, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Shah", "ForeName": "Jehandar", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Peshawar, KPK, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Bashir", "ForeName": "Shumaila", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproductive Physiology Lab, Department of Animal Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Jahan", "ForeName": "Sarwat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproductive Physiology Lab, Department of Animal Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hizbullah", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzymes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Protective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "BBX060AN9V", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Amaranthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Comet Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Enzymes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Peroxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Lymphocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Protective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sapotaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31081772"]}}]}
