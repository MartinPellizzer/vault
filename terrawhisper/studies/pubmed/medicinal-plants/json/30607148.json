The objective of this study was to explore the protective effects of TQ on diazinon (DZN)-induced liver toxicity in the mouse model. The animals were divided into five groups of 6 each and treated intraperitoneally. Group 1 received the vehicle, group 2 was given 16 mg/kg DZN, group 3 received 5 mg/kg TQ, and groups 4 and 5 were treated with 1.25 and 5 mg/kg of TQ as well as 16 mg/kg DZN, respectively. Finally, butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serum activity as well as nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxidation (LPO), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total thiol molecule (TTM), and histopathological experiments were evaluated in the liver samples. Our findings showed that DZN caused a significant increase in ALT (<i>P</i> < 0.01), AST (<i>P</i> < 0.001), ALP (<i>P</i> < 0.001) serum levels, LPO (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and NO (<i>P</i> < 0.001), the depletion of the TAC (<i>P</i> < 0.05) and TTM (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and structural changes in the liver tissue. Following TQ administration, a significant improvement was observed in the oxidative stress biomarkers in the liver tissue. In addition, our biochemical findings were correlated well to the histopathological examinations. In conclusion, the data from this study indicate that the administration of TQ may prevent liver damage by preventing free radical formation in animals exposed to DZN."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants and Natural Products Research Center, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, I.R.
