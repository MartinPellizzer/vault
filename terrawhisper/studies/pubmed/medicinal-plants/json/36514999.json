Recent and prospective increases in pest pressure in both indoor and outdoor Cannabis production systems, and the need for effective nonchemical pest control technologies (particularly crucial in the context of cultivating plants for medical purposes), are discussed. We support the idea that developing RNAi tactics towards protection of medical Cannabis could play a major role in maximizing success in this continuously expanding industry. However, there remain critical knowledge gaps, especially with regard to RNA pesticide biosafety from a human toxicological viewpoint, as a result of the medical context of Cannabis product use. Furthermore, efforts are needed to optimize transformation and micropropagation of Cannabis plants, examine cutting edge RNAi techniques for various Cannabis-pest scenarios, and investigate the combined application of RNAi- and biological control tactics in medical Cannabis cultivation. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
