Thirty seedlings of C. pilosula were collected from the main production areas in Gansu province, such as Weiyuan, Minxian, Zhangxian, Dangchang and Longxi, root length and diameter and weight of all the samples were measured. According to the clustering results, seedlings were divided into 3 levels, and field experiments were conducted with three levels seedling, yield and quality were tested in laboratory. Results have showed that emergence of grades 1 was faster than that of grades 2 and 3. Yield of grades 1 was significantly higher than that of grades 2 and 3 (P<0.05). Propargyl glycoside content of grades 1 was the highest, and significantly higher than that of grades 3. Polysaccharide content of grades 3 was the highest and significantly higher than that of grades 1 and 2 (P<0.05). So considering yield, quality and investment cost of C. pilosula, planting seedlings of C. pilosula should select that root length>15.6 cm, root diameter>2.7 mm, root weight>0.56 g."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Hui-Zhen", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Weiyuan County's Agricultural Technical Guidance Station, Dingxi 748200, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Zhong-Xue", "Initials": "ZX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Guo-di", "Initials": "GD"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Yu-Fang", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jia", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jin-Tian", "Initials": "JT"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality and Standard of Gansu Province, Gansu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Codonopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28929680", "10.4268/cjcmm20162111"]}}]}
