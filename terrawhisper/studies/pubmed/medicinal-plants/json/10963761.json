Ginsenosides induce differential antinociception and inhibit substance P-induced nociceptive response in mice. Life Science 62, PL319-PL325). In the present study we further investigated whether ginsenosides produce antinociceptive effects through an action at central or peripheral site(s) and whether these effects are mediated by the opioid system. Intraperitoneally injected ginsenosides suppressed in a dose-dependent manner the pain-related behavior produced by capsaicin injection into the plantar surface of the hind paw; the ED(50) was 49 mg/kg [26-92 mg/kg, 95% confidence interval (C.I.)]. Intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly administered ginsenosides also suppressed the capsaicin-induced pain-related behavior in a dose-dependent manner; the ED(50)s were 1.72 mg/kg (0.8-3.72 mg/kg, 95% C.I.) and 1. 48 mg/kg (0.8-2.6 mg/kg, 95% C.I.), respectively. On the other hand, subcutaneously injected ginsenosides to the plantar surface prior to the capsaicin injection did not alter the pain-related behavior. Naloxone pretreatment was without effect in blocking the antinociceptive effect of intrathecally administered ginsenosides. Intraperitoneally injected ginsenosides also did not significantly affect the motor response of animals. These results suggest that ginsenosides produce antinociceptive effects through their action at the spinal and/or supraspinal site(s), not at nociceptors in the periphery. In addition, the results suggest that the antinociceptive effects are not mediated by opioid receptors."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Chonnam National University College of Veterinary Medicine, Kwangju 500-757, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nah", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hahn", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chung", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Choi", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Y I", "Initials": "YI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nah", "ForeName": "S Y", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Neuropharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "0236217", "ISSNLinking": "0028-3908"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ginsenosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Saponins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginsenosides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Hindlimb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Measurement"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Saponins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10963761", "10.1016/s0028-3908(00)00048-4", "S0028390800000484"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
