Total RNA were isolated and used as templates for reverse transcriptional labeling of fluorescent cDNA probes. High density DNA microarray chips with a set of 13,872 human genes/Ests were used to generate the expression profile of triptolide-treated or untreated control Jurkat cells by hybridizing with fluorescent labeled probes. Array image was acquired and analyzed with array analyzing software GeneSpring.", "Triptolide significantly suppressed expression of 117 genes in Jurkat cells. Among these 117 genes, 30 % were Ests or genes without known functions, 13 % were transcription factors, 9 % were signal transduction pathway regulators, and 9 % were DNA binding proteins. Notably, the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP kinase 5) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) was inhibited more than 100-fold. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in lipid transportation and metabolism was down-regulated by triptolide.", "High-density microarray provided an effective approach to identify drug targeting molecules. It is suggested that the widely known immune suppressive and antitumor effects of triptolide were mediated at least in part by suppression of MAP kinase and PI-3 kinase gene expression."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Du", "ForeName": "Ze-Ying", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Yu", "Initials": "XY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yuan-Chao", "Initials": "YC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Shun-You", "Initials": "SY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "19ALD1S53J", "NameOfSubstance": "triptolide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.25", "NameOfSubstance": "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.25", "NameOfSubstance": "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.7.11.25", "NameOfSubstance": "MAP3K5 protein, human"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Epoxy Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Immunosuppressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Jurkat Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 5"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenanthrenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tripterygium"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "9", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12956933"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
