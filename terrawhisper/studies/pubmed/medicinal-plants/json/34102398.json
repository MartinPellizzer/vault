In DTS, isomers of these compounds are individually collected and asymmetrically transformed to the mixtures of isomers. After separating the mixture with an identical method, high-purity compounds can be prepared from the newly generated isomers but impurities remain in another one. To validate the effectiveness, a DTS was developed to prepare punicalagin in gram-scale from pomegranate peel waste. Isomerization kinetic and thermodynamic of punicalagin were accurately assayed by dynamic HPLC built on low-temperature or/and loop-based stop-flow two-dimensional liquid chromatography. After the isomerization based on it, 9.3\u00a0g of pomegranate peel extract was firstly separated on C18 column, and F<sub>\u03b1</sub> and F<sub>\u03b2</sub> around \u03b1-punicalagin and \u03b2-punicalagin were obtained. Then, the proportion of \u03b1-punicalagin in F<sub>\u03b1</sub> and F<sub>\u03b2</sub> was optimized to 52.7% and 32.0% based on isomerization kinetics and thermodynamic. With the aid of low-temperature injection, F<sub>\u03b1</sub> and F<sub>\u03b2</sub> were loaded and secondly purified. After waste recycling, totally 3.0\u00a0g of punicalagin with the purify of 99.5% was obtained within two days, which would strongly support the resource utilization of pomegranate peel waste. Because only an individual method was employed in the two-step purification, the separation in DTS was fully compatible."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
