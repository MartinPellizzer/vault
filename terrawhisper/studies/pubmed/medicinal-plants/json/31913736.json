Several of them have been isolated from sage plants and assayed for their potential therapeutic use against cancer. In this study, we report the effects of three potent anticancer terpenoids previously isolated from <i>Salvia lachnocalyx</i>, including geranyl farnesol (<b>1</b>), sahandinone (<b>2</b>), and 4-dehydrosalvilimbinol (<b>3</b>) on cancer cell cycle alterations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Interactions of compounds <b>1-3</b> with topoisomerase I were also investigated by using molecular docking and dynamics simulation. Accumulation of cells in sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle indicated that all tested compounds induce apoptosis in MOLT-4 cancer cells. Measurement of ROS production demonstrated that this mechanism is not involved in the induction of apoptosis. We suggest topoisomerase I inhibition as the mechanism of cytotoxic activity of compounds <b>1-3</b> based on docking and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. These natural terpenoids could be considered as good candidates for further development as anticancer agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Physiology, Agricultural Biotechnology Research Institute of Iran, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hadavand Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3918-361X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jassbi", "ForeName": "Amir Reza", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7443-8078"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Pirhadi", "ForeName": "Somayeh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3918-361X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Firuzi", "ForeName": "Omidreza", "Initials": "O"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Recept Signal Transduct Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9509432", "ISSNLinking": "1079-9893"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.99.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Algorithms"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Binding Sites"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Shape"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Bonding"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "MCF-7 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Docking Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Salvia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31913736", "10.1080/10799893.2019.1710847"]}}]}
