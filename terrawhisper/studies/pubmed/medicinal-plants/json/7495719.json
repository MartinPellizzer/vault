Three different methods of treatment were classified from the cases: intracapsular (the traditional couching), extracapsular, and zonulysis. The operations were carried out on the left eye in 64%, bilateral in 27%, and right in 9%. Complications noted were uveitis, glaucoma, lens in pupil, posterior capsule opacification, cystoid macular oedema (CMO) but infection was conspicuously absent. Some of the results were good. With those that did not appear acceptable and could be further improved patients either received partial management or did not bother. Pain was the worrying symptom. These results of the traditional methods are not desirable but until intra-ocular lens implantation is widely practised in Ghana traditional methods are likely to compete with orthodox methods to a variable degree."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, University of Ghana Medical School, Accra."}], "LastName": "Ntim-Amponsah", "ForeName": "C T", "Initials": "CT"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Nigeria", "MedlineTA": "West Afr J Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8301891", "ISSNLinking": "0189-160X"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cataract Extraction"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ghana"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hospitals, Teaching"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, African Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Treatment Outcome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7495719"]}}]}
