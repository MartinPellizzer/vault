The results showed that there were 3 genera and 44 species (including the varieties) of Primulaceae plants were recorded in the relevant literatures. Among them, 17 varieties were recorded in Tibetan names, 24 varieties were recorded in Chinese names and 1 variety was used in both of them. In current quality criteria of standards at all levels in China country, 6 varieties were recorded in Tibetan names and 6 original plants were involved, which were 35% and 14% of them respectively. Seventeen varieties were recorded in Chinese name and 7 original plants were involved, which were 30% and 16% of them respectively. In Tibetan medicine standards and literatures, there were big differences between Tibetan names and Chinese names which were translated from Tibetan names and its original plants. There were only regulations of morphological identification and microscopic authentication, so the standards were very inadequate. Therefore, through literatures research, resources and current situation investigations, combining the research and specification of the name and original of Tibetan medicine, the level of normalization and standardization could be enhanced, the stable and controllable safety and utility in clinical medication could be ensured to promote advancement of industry technology Tibetan medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Chang-Hua", "Initials": "CH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Ben-Xia", "Initials": "BX"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Hua-Rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Xiang", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Materia Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Sub-center of National Resource Center for Chinese Materia Medica, China Academy of Chinese Medical Science, Chongqing 400065, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Traditional Chinese Resources, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Zhi-Wei", "Initials": "ZW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangxi Synergistic Innovation Center of Modern Technology and Industrial Development of Traditional Ethnic Medicines, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Guo-Yue", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Tibetan Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification"], "DescriptorName": "Primulaceae"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28936852", "10.4268/cjcmm20162427"]}}]}
