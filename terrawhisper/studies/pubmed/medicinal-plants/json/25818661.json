Recent experiences have shown that synthetic drugs have undesirable side effects. Recent studies on medicinal plants have shown that they might be effective in treatment of different stages of addiction with lower side effects and costs. The aim of this study was to review the effects of medicinal plants in the treatment of morphine addiction in experimental animals. In this review article, by using keywords of morphine, withdrawal, and plants or herbal medicine in databases of indexing cites, desired articles were obtained since 1994. Inclusion criteria for selecting articles were the articles related to application of medicinal plants in decreasing symptoms resulting from morphine withdrawal were selected. Results of this study on experimental studies have shown that medicinal plants such as Trachyspermum copticum L and Melissa officinalis decrease the symptoms of withdrawal syndrome in a dose-dependent. Also, medicinal plants like Avena sativa, Hypericum perforatu, Passiflora incarnate, Valeriana officinalis, Satureja hortensis L, and Mentha piperita can have effects on behavior, emotions, and other problems of addicts, decreasing withdrawal symptoms. Results of this study showed that medicinal plants can be effective in controlling deprivation, decreasing dependency creation, and possibly DETOXIFICATION: of opioid addicts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Ebrahimie", "ForeName": "Marzieh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Food and Beverages Safety Research Center, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahmani", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Shirzad", "ForeName": "Hedayatollah", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Islamic Republic of Iran rafieian@yahoo.com."}], "LastName": "Rafieian-Kopaei", "ForeName": "Mahmoud", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran."}], "LastName": "Saki", "ForeName": "Kourosh", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Evid Based Complementary Altern Med", "NlmUniqueID": "101556804", "ISSNLinking": "2156-5899"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics, Opioid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Opioid-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "2", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25818661", "10.1177/2156587215577896", "2156587215577896"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
