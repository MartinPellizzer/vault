Plasma samples were deproteinized with acetonitrile-acetic acid (9:1), followed by evaporation of the acetonitrile to dryness. The resultant residue was then dissolved in mobile phase and HPLC separation was achieved on a Hypersil C18 (200 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 microm) column at room temperature. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water (12:88) with 1% acetic acid and 1% tetrahydrofuran at a flow rate of 0.7 mL x min(-1). The UV detection wavelength was set at 320 nm.", "The calibration curve was shown to be linear over the range from 0.536 to 26.8 microg x mL(-1) (r2 > or = 0.995). Mean recovery was determined as 92.7%. Within-day and between-day precisions were less than 9. 1% RSD. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.536 microg x mL(-1). The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax) and the apparent elimination half-life (T1/2) were (10.5 +/- 2.2) microg x mL(-1), (5.8 +/- 0.4) h and (5.0 +/- 0.3) h, respectively.", "The validated HPLC method developed has been applied to take a limited view of pharmacokinetics profile of mangiferin in rat plasma after having orally taken a single dose of Suanzaoren decoction."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang 110016, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Yu-juan", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bi", "ForeName": "Kai-shun", "Initials": "KS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Yao Xue Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "21710340R", "ISSNLinking": "0513-4870"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Xanthones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1M84LD0UMD", "NameOfSubstance": "mangiferin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Oral"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Anemarrhena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Xanthones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ziziphus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "5", "Day": "7", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15875675"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
