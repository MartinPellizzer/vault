The aqueous extracts prepared from the leaves of Schizolobium parahyba (a plant found in Mata Atlantica in Southeastern Brazil) were assayed for their ability to inhibit some enzymatic and biological activities induced by Bothrops pauloensis and Crotalus durissus terrificus venoms as well as by their isolated toxins neuwiedase (metalloproteinase), BnSP-7 (basic Lys49 PLA(2)) and CB (PLA(2) from crotoxin complex). Phospholipase A(2), coagulant, fibrinogenolytic, hemorrhagic and myotoxic activities induced by B. pauloensis and C. d. terrificus venoms, as well as by their isolated toxins were significantly inhibited when different amounts of S. parahyba were incubated previously with these venoms and toxins before assays. However, when S. parahyba was administered at the same route as the venoms or toxins injections, the tissue local damage, such as hemorrhage and myotoxicity was only partially inhibited. The study also evaluated the inhibitory effect of S. parahyba upon the spreading of venom proteins from the injected area into the systemic circulation. The neutralization of systemic alterations induced by i.m. injection of B. pauloensis venom was evaluated by measuring platelet and plasma fibrinogen levels which were significantly maintained when S. parahyba extract inoculation occurred at the same route after B. pauloensis venom injection. In conclusion, the observations confirmed that the aqueous extract of S. parahyba possesses potent snake venom neutralizing properties. It may be used as an alternative treatment to serum therapy and as a rich source of potential inhibitors of toxins involved in several physiopathological human and animal diseases."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Instituto de Gen\u00e9tica e Bioqu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal de Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia-MG, Brazil."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mendes", "ForeName": "Mirian M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Oliveira", "ForeName": "Carolina F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lopes", "ForeName": "Daiana S", "Initials": "DS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Vale", "ForeName": "Lu\u00eds Henrique F", "Initials": "LH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Alc\u00e2ntara", "ForeName": "T\u00e2nia M", "Initials": "TM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Izidoro", "ForeName": "Luiz Fernando M", "Initials": "LF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hamaguchi", "ForeName": "Am\u00e9lia", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Homsi-Brandeburgo", "ForeName": "Maria In\u00eas", "Initials": "MI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Soares", "ForeName": "Andreimar M", "Initials": "AM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rodrigues", "ForeName": "Veridiana M", "Initials": "VM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antivenins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Crotalid Venoms"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9001-32-5", "NameOfSubstance": "Fibrinogen"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.32", "NameOfSubstance": "Phospholipases A"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antivenins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Casearia"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "enzymology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Crotalid Venoms"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fibrinogen"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Necrosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Phospholipases A"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rosales"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "6", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18567056", "10.1002/ptr.2371"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
