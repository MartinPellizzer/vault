The widespread and imprudent use of antibacterial agents in poultry flocks have increased resistant to many antibacterial agents which has become a major public health concern. Some medicinal plants may be alternative to antibacterial agents. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of summer savory essential oil against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> isolated from poultry.", "The essential oil was extracted using a Clevenger apparatus and subsequently its compounds were determined using GC-MS. Antibacterial properties of essential oil were determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). To evaluate the anti-biofilm properties the Microtiter plate test was used. Herbal essential oil was extracted and its compounds were identified correctly.", "The major components of <i>Satureja hortensis</i> essential oil were thymol (41.28%), \u03b3-terpinene (37.63%), p-cymene (12.2%) and \u03b1-terpinene (3.52%). The inhibition zone diameter in the disc diffusion test for <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> were 32 \u00b1 3 and 38 \u00b1 4 mm, respectively, which was confirmed by MIC and MBC values. Regarding anti-biofilm activity, the MIC/2 concentration of <i>S. hortensis</i> significantly inhibited biofilm formation of <i>E. coli</i>. However, inhibition of biofilm formation of <i>Salmonella</i> was shown at concentration of MIC/2 and MIC/4.", "Based on our results, <i>S. hortensis</i> essential oil showed the growth inhibition and bactericidal activity against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i>. Moreover, this study demonstrated anti-biofilm activity of <i>S. hortensis</i> essential against both tested bacteria."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Authors.
