In this paper, the R2 R3-MYB transcription factors were identified by bioinformatics analysis of the genomic data of Erigeron breviscapus, and their gene sequences, structures, physical and chemical properties were analyzed. The functions of R2 R3-MYB transcription factors were predicted by cluster analysis. Meanwhile, the expression patterns of R2 R3-MYB transcription factors in response to hormone treatments were analyzed. A total of 108 R2 R3-MYB transcription factors, named EbMYB1-EbMYB108, were identified from the genome of E. breviscapus. Most of the R2 R3-MYB genes carried 2-4 exons. The phylogenetic tree of MYBs in E. breviscapus and Arabidopsis thaliala was constructed, which classified 234 MYBs into 30 subfamilies. The MYBs in the five MYB subfamilies of A.thaliala were clustered into independent clades, and those in E. breviscapus were clustered into four clades. The transcriptome data showed that MYB genes were differentially expressed in different tissues of E. breviscapus and in response to the treatments with exogenous hormones such as ABA, SA, and GA for different time. The transcription of 13 R2 R3-MYB genes did not change significantly, and the expression patterns of some genes were up-regulated or down-regulated with the extension of hormone treatment time. This study provides a theoretical basis for revealing the mechanisms of R2 R3-MYB transcription factors in regulating the growth and development, stress(hormone) response, and active ingredient accumulation in E. breviscapus."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China College of Agronomy and Biotechnology,Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Song", "ForeName": "Wan-Ling", "Initials": "WL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Xiang", "ForeName": "Gui-Sheng", "Initials": "GS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Ying-Chun", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Guang-Hui", "Initials": "GH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Sheng-Chao", "Initials": "SC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National & Local Joint Engineering Research Center on Germplasm Utilization & Innovation of Chinese Medicinal Materials in Southwest China, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China the Key Laboratory of Medicinal Plant Biology of Yunnan Province, Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China College of Agronomy and Biotechnology,Yunnan Agricultural University Kunming 650201, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Transcription Factors"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Erigeron"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, myb"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phylogeny"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "13"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34951242", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20210924.101"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
