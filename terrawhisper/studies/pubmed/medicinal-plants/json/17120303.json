Absorption at 276 nm was chosen as the measuring wavelength at which resolution and baseline separation of compounds (1) and (2) could be obtained. The identity of the above two isomeric compounds (1) and (2) in the samples was unambiguously determined by their respective quasi-molecular ion [M - H]- in ESI-MS. Compounds (1) and (2) were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in the above three samples of Garcinia indica. The overall analytical procedure is rapid and reproducible and is considered for the analysis of the above two compounds."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, PO CIMAP, Lucknow-226015, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Satyanshu", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chattopadhyay", "ForeName": "Sunil K", "Initials": "SK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biomed Chromatogr", "NlmUniqueID": "8610241", "ISSNLinking": "0269-3879"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzophenones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "isoxanthochymol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "52617-32-0", "NameOfSubstance": "xanthochymol"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Benzophenones"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Garcinia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "3", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "11", "Day": "23", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17120303", "10.1002/bmc.726"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
