Ovaries of treated rats remained in a cyclic state rather than undergoing pregnancy as demonstrated by constant ovulation accompanied by newly formed corpora lutea. Follicles were present in different stages of development. Uterine histoarchitecture of treated rats appeared non-receptive for implantation. No decidcoma were observed on day 5 of pregnancy and the luminal epithelium remained unresponsive. Uterus was non-oedematous and lumen was considerably wider. Administration of the extract caused increases in the protein and glycogen content of ovary and uterus, while the activity of acid phosphatase remained essentially unchanged and the activity of alkaline phosphatase was increased. The volume of uterine fluid in the treated rats was increased considerably on day 5 post coitum. It appears that the histological and biochemical modifications in the ovary and uterus of treated pregnant rats do not support the preparation of uterus for implantation."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Studies in Zoology, Jiwaji University, Gwalior, India."}], "LastName": "Prakash", "ForeName": "A O", "Initials": "AO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pathak", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mathur", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2DDG612ED8", "NameOfSubstance": "n-hexane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.3.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaline Phosphatase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Fluids"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptives, Postcoital"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ferula"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Organ Size"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}, {"QualifierName": ["anatomy & histology", "drug effects", "enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Uterus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1795527", "10.1016/0378-8741(91)90041-b", "0378-8741(91)90041-B"]}}]}
