Both of the drugs showed good results before, during and after fertilization in male and female mice. The results revealed that the crude extract of Lipidium meyenii caused a significant decrease in the no. of writhes at 300 and 500mg/kg (p<0.05) as compare to control, Epimidium sagittatum and standard drug. The gross behavioral, open field, exploratory behaviour, forced swimming test for stress, diuretic activity, chronic toxicity with the effect on reproduction of both male and female and change in body weight were also studied. The phytochemical study showed the presence of tannin, alkaloid, carbohydrate, rich protein and absence of sterol in LM, whereas ES shows presence of sterol and less protein. LS improve in muscle activity and exploratory behaviours without any toxic effects on mice and their pups. It does not have diuretic effect for first two hour but act normally after initial phase of drug therapy. Epimidium sagittatum has dual action that is at low dose it has slight stimulation action and at high dose little depressive effect. ES also has some diuretic effect. Overall these results suggest that LM is highly effective remedy for treatment of impotency and reduces stress and depression, because of dual effect ES not only suggested as an anxiolytic medicine but also effective in female hormonal disorder."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Qureshi", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science &Technology, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Mehjabeen", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Dow College of Pharmacy, Dow University of Health Sciences, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Noorjahan", "ForeName": "-", "Initials": "-"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Balochistan, Quetta, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Muhammad", "ForeName": "Shafi", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan / Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Central Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Siddiqui", "ForeName": "Faheem Ahmed", "Initials": "FA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Baig", "ForeName": "Iftikhar", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Ahmad", "ForeName": "Mansoor", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Diuretics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fertility Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Q40Q9N063P", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Anxiety Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antidepressive Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Behavior, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease Models, Animal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Diuresis"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Diuretics"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Epimedium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Lepidium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Motor Activity"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Pain Threshold"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Social Behavior"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "6", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "11", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28603109"]}}]}
