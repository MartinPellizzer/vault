The nanocomposite was successfully applied to remove of diclofenac sodium (DCF) - a widely used pharmaceutical - from water. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the adsorption process and assess the interactions among the influencing factors on DCF removal efficiency; including contact time, adsorbent dosage, initial pH, solution temperature, and DCF concentration. Adsorption isotherm results showed a good fitting with the Langmuir isotherm model with an exceptional adsorption capacity value of 2594\u00a0mg\u00a0g<sup>-1</sup> at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, which was highly superior to the previously reported adsorbents. In addition, kinetic and thermodynamic investigations further illustrated that the adsorption process was fast (equilibrium time\u00a0=\u00a050\u00a0min) and endothermic. The regeneration of GO/ZIF-8/\u03b3-AlOOH nanocomposite using acetic acid solution (10% v/v) after a simple magnetic separation was confirmed in five consecutive cycles, which eliminate the usage of organic solvents. The nanocomposite has also shown a superior performance in treating a simulated hospital effluent that contained various pharmaceuticals as well as other organic, and inorganic constituents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
