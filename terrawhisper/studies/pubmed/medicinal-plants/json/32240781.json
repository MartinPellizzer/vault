The protective effects of Ashwagandha were accomplished by restoring mitochondrial and endothelial function, mitigation of apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms.", "In this review, we recapitulated neuroprotective properties of Ashwagandha extracts and/or its major constituents and discussed their mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications. The pre-clinical as well as clinical studies suggest the use of Withania somnifera (L.) against neurodegenerative disease. However, extensive studies are warranted to validate the use of extract or its single constituents for its clinical use."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
