And then effects of different organic solvents(paraffin, organic acid, alcohol and ester), their volumetric fraction and phase toxicity were studied on taxol release in the two-liquid-phase cultures of Taxus cuspidata. The results showed that the addition of the rare earth compound or the organic solvents could strengthen obviously taxol release, especially the organic solvents. But the addition of the rare earth compound could not strengthen further taxol release in the twoliquid-phase cultures of Taxus cuspidata. Therefore the organic solvents were very good permeabilizing reagents, which could enhance obviously secondary metabolite in the twoliquid-phase cultures of plant cells. Release percentage of taxol was increased into more than 75% from 40% of the control."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Bioengineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Z L", "Initials": "ZL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Di", "ForeName": "J S", "Initials": "JS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yuan", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Z D", "Initials": "ZD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9426463", "ISSNLinking": "1000-3061"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Solvents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P88XT4IS4D", "NameOfSubstance": "Paclitaxel"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Paclitaxel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Solvents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Taxus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "10", "Day": "29", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11051828"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
