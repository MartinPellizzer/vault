Myricetin (MY) is a flavonoid distributed in many edible and medicinal plants. In this study, MY was identified to inhibit IFN-\u03b3-induced PD-L1 expression in human lung cancer cells. It also reduced the expression of IDO1 and the production of kynurenine which is the product catalyzed by IDO1, while didn't show obvious effect on the expression of major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I), a crucial molecule for antigen presentation. In addition, the function of T cells was evaluated using a co-culture system consist of lung cancer cells and the Jurkat-PD-1 T cell line overexpressing PD-1. MY restored the survival, proliferation, CD69 expression and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion of Jurkat-PD-1 T cells suppressed by IFN-\u03b3-treated lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, IFN-\u03b3 up-regulated PD-L1 and IDO1 at the transcriptional level through the JAK-STAT-IRF1 axis, which was targeted and inhibited by MY. Together, our research revealed a new mechanism of MY mediated anti-tumor activity and highlighted the potential implications of MY in tumor immunotherapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
