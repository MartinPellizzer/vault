In order to elucidate the penile vibratory threshold changes and clinical effects of various doses of SS-cream, 53 patients with primary PE were investigated in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study. The mean age was 37.3 +/- 6.4 years and mean ejaculatory latency was 1.37 +/- 0.52 minutes. Neither the patients nor their sexual partners were satisfied with their sexual lives. Vibratory threshold at the glans penis, penile shaft, scrotum and index finger were measured using a biothesiometer twice during the screening period and three times one hour after the application of respective creams (SS-cream 0.05, 0.10. 0.15, 0.20 gm and placebo 0.10 gm) on the glans penis according to the order of the allocation table in a randomized fashion. The efficacy of SS-cream was defined as when the vibration threshold increased by more than 4 microns compared to the value tested during the screening period. The vibratory thresholds at the glans penis increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner after the application of various doses (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 gm) of SS-cream (p < 0.001), and the efficacy of SS-cream on the penile vibration threshold increased according to the increased dosage (penile shaft: 48.4, 51.6, 54.8, 64.5%, glans penis: 58.1, 67.7, 77.4, 83.9%, respectively). With these results, we concluded that SS-cream increased the penile sensory threshold dose dependently, and therefore it is clinically effective for treating the heightened penile sensory response in patients with PE."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.
