In Experiment 2, WL was included proportionally with soybean meal in corn-soy diets of female turkeys from 0 to 17 wk of age. Soybean meal: WL ratios (S:WL) were 1:0 (control), 2:1, 1:1, and 6:1. At 17 wk of age hens on S:WL diets of 2:1 had body weights that were similar to those of birds fed the corn-soy control diets. Growth of hens fed S:WL diets of 6:1 was depressed (P less than .05). Growth depressions were greatest earlier in the study; older birds made compensatory gains. Feed efficiency of hens fed S:WL diets of 1:1 was poorer than that of controls during 0 to 11 wk but better than that of controls after 11 wk of age. Feed efficiency values were similar during 0 to 17 wk for hens fed control and S:WL diets of 2:1 and 1:1. Sensory evaluation of roasted light and dark meat of market birds revealed no taste differences in relation to WL level in the diet."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Science, University of Minnesota, St. Paul 55108."}], "LastName": "Halvorson", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Waibel", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Shehata", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Poult Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "0401150", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5791"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animal Feed"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Turkeys"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3405936", "10.3382/ps.0670596", "S0032-5791(19)56550-6"]}}]}
