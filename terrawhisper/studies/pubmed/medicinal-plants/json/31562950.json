MSCs are thus of therapeutic interest for cell-based therapy but great efforts are needed to enhance their efficiency and safety. Herbal remedies and in particular their bioactive molecules, are potential candidates for improving human health. The novelty and originality of this study is to develop an efficient cell-therapeutic product by combining MSCs with medicinal plant derived bioactive molecules. Thus, the impact of Essential Oil, Thymol and Carvacrol from Ptychotis verticillata on several BM-MSC biological features were studied. These compounds have shown positive effects on MSCs by preserving their morphology, sustaining their viability, promoting their proliferation, protecting them from cytotoxicity and oxidative stress. Accordingly, the combined administration of P. verticillata extract and MSCs may represent a new approach to enhance the therapeutic issue. Further investigations should greatly improve the manufacturing of these compounds as well as our understanding of the therapeutic effects of these bioactive molecules on the biology and functions of MSCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Ltd.
