(AIL), a parasitic plant, induces potent antitumor immunity against Meth A fibrosarcomas in BALB/c mice. AIL also possesses a thymocyte co-stimulatory effect in vitro with suboptimal dose of Con A, a B cell mitogenic effect, and stimulates AIL-primed CD4+ T cells to produce Th1-type cytokines. In this study, we investigated the relationship between mitogenicity and antitumor activity with AIL. When AIL was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, there was strong and diffuse staining in the region between 14 kDa and the bottom of polyacrylamide gel and it was unaffected when AIL was digested with proteinase K (PK) before SDS-PAGE. Some bands with different molecular mass were also found in silver-stained gel and they disappeared completely by incubating AIL with PK before SDS-PAGE. The in vitro thymocyte co-stimulatory and B cell mitogenic effects were not influenced by digesting AIL with PK but were completely suppressed by the oxidation of AIL with sodium periodate before culture. In contrast, the in vivo antitumor activity was completely abolished by PK, but it was not affected by periodate oxidation. We generated mAbs specific for AIL and investigated the influence on the antitumor activity of AIL in vivo. Around 60-80% of tumor-bearing mice failed to recover from a challenge tumor when they were treated with supernatants isolated from mAb-induced precipitation reactions. Immunoblotting (Western blotting) revealed that all the mAbs reacted exclusively with a 50-60 kDa protein and that this reactivity was not influenced after oxidizing the blots with sodium periodate. We demonstrated that AIL contains polysaccharides and proteins. The polysaccharides induced B cell mitogenic and thymocyte co-stimulatory effects in vitro, while the proteins, especially a 50-60 kDa protein containing non-carbohydrate epitopes recognized by the mAbs, mediated antitumor activity in vivo."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Parasitology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Tokushima, Japan."}], "LastName": "Chai", "ForeName": "J G", "Initials": "JG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Okamoto", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bando", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nagasawa", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hisaeda", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sakai", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Himeno", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sato", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ohkubo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacology", "NlmUniqueID": "7902474", "ISSNLinking": "0162-3109"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Interleukin-6"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mitogens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Monoclonal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoblotting"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Interleukin-6"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred BALB C"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mitogens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1995", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8557520", "10.1016/0162-3109(95)00024-n", "016231099500024N"]}}]}
