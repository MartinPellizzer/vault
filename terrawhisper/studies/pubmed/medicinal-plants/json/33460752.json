Diosgenin rich fresh extracts of Paris polyphylla rhizome from Indian Himalaya is traditionally used as wound healing, anti-bleeding, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agent by the folk healers.", "Present study was aimed to prepare two types of extracts from Paris polyphylla rhizome of Indian Himalayan landraces - 1. ethanolic extract of Paris polyphylla rhizome (EEPPR) and 2. Diosgenin enriched Paris polyphylla rhizome extract (DPPE), quantification of diosgenin content, and to evaluate their in vitro anti-oxidant, in vivo anti-inflammatory and in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activities of the DPPE.", "Diosgenin content of EEPPR was quantified through GC-MS while diosgenin content of DPPE was quantified through HPTLC, and the diosgenin yield from EEPPR and DPPE were compared. In vitro antioxidant activities of DPPE were performed using DPPH, NOD, RP and SOD assay while in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of DPPE were evaluated in dextran induced hind paw edema in rats. In vitro cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activities of DPPE were evaluated in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa) and Hep-2\u00a0cell lines.", "EEPPR obtained through cold extraction method using 70% ethanol showed maximum diosgenin content of 17.90% quantified through GC-MS while similar compounds pennogenin (3.29%), 7\u03b2-Dehydrodiosgenin (1.90%), 7-Ketodiosgenin acetate (1.14%), and 7 \u03b2-hydroxydiosgenin (0.55%) were detected in low concentration, and thus confirmed diosgenin as major and lead phytochemical. However, DPPE obtained through both cold and repeated hot extraction with the same solvent (70% ethanol) showed diosgenin content of 60.29% which is significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than the diosgenin content in EEPPR. DPPE demonstrated significant in vitro antioxidant activities by dose-dependently quenched (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) SOD free radicals by 76.66%, followed by DPPH (71.43%), NOD (67.35%), and RP (63.74%) at a max concentration of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/\u03bcl of ascorbic acid and test drugs with remarkable IC<sub>50</sub> values (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Further, DPPE also showed potent anti-inflammatory activities by dose-dependently suppressed dextran induced paw edema in rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) from 2\u00a0h to 4\u00a0h. DPPE suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Hep-2 and HeLa cell lines. Maximum activity was observed in MCF-7\u00a0cells. The DPPE also induced apoptosis in MCF-7\u00a0cell lines as measured by AO/PI and DAPI staining, as well as DNA laddering, cell cycle analysis and phosphatidylserine externalization assay. The growth-inhibitory effect of DPPE on MCF-7 breast cancer cells was further confirmed from the colony-formation assay. DPPE upregulated expression of Bax and downregulated Bcl-2 and survivin mRNA transcripts.", "DPPE obtained through both cold and repeated hot extraction using ethanol showed significantly higher content of diosgenin than the diosgenin content detected in EEPPR. However, diosgenin yield of both the extracts (EEPPR & DPPE) clearly confirmed diosgenin as major and lead phytochemical of Paris polyphylla rhizome of Indian Himalayan landraces. Further, DPPE also demonstrated potent in vitro anti-oxidative and in vivo anti-inflammatory activities and showed in vitro cytotoxicity and significant anti-cancer (apoptosis) effects in MCF-7 breast cancer cells."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
