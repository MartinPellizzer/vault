Scutellarin is a flavone extracted from certain medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. This research study was done to investigate the beneficial effect of scutellarin on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) murine model of AKI.", "Five groups of mice were used including control (without LPS injection), LPS group (LPS injection, 10\u2009mg/kg), and LPS\u2009+\u2009Scutellarin25, 50, and/or 100 groups (receiving scutellarin orally at different doses of 25, 50, or 100\u2009mg/kg before LPS injection).", "Scutellarin pretreatment effectively lowered kidney function markers (BUN, creatinine, and cystatin C), improved superoxide dismutase (SOD) besides enhancement of level, and/or gene expression for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and also reduced oxidative stress factors including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA). In addition, scutellarin reduced tissue level and/or gene expression of inflammatory markers comprising toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and properly raised anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. Moreover, scutellarin enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and attenuated histopathological changes in renal tissue subsequent to LPS challenge. Beneficial effects of scutellarin was associated with improvement of gene expression regarding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and its coactivator PGC-1\u03b1 as specific markers of mitochondrial biogenesis.", "These results indicate that scutellarin could protect against LPS-provoked AKI through restraining inflammation and oxidative stress and maintenance of mitochondrial health and biogenesis which is partly mediated through its regulation of Nrf2/PPAR-\u03b3/PGC-1\u03b1/NF-kB/TLR4."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahmohammadi", "ForeName": "Alireza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology and Cellular and Molecular Biology Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Golchoobian", "ForeName": "Ravieh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirahmadi", "ForeName": "Seyed-Mohamad-Sadegh", "Initials": "SM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Rousta", "ForeName": "Ali-Mohammad", "Initials": "AM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ansari", "ForeName": "Fariba", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharayeli", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Baluchnejadmojarad", "ForeName": "Tourandokht", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Neurophysiology Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roghani", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol", "NlmUniqueID": "8800150", "ISSNLinking": "0892-3973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "16IGP0ML9A", "NameOfSubstance": "scutellarin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "NF-kappa B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Toll-Like Receptor 4"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-E2-Related Factor 2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "NF-kappa B"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acute Kidney Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "5", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "10", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "13"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36314857", "10.1080/08923973.2022.2141644"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
