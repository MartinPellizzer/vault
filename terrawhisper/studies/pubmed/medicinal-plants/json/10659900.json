Blood samples were collected in the early morning on the bed-rest. In postmenopausal women with climacteric syndromes such as fatigue, insomnia and depression, psychological tests using the Cornell Medical Index (CMI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were performed before and 30 days after treatment with RG.", "CMI score as well as anxiety (A)-state in STAI score in postmenopausal women with climacteric syndromes was significantly higher than that without climacteric syndrome, while DHEA-S levels in postmenopausal women with climacteric syndromes were about a half of those without climacteric syndrome. Consequently, cortisol/DHEA-S (C/D) ratio was significantly higher in postmenopausal women with climacteric syndromes than in those without climacteric syndrome. When postmenopausal women with climacteric syndromes were treated with daily oral administration of 6 g RG for 30 days, CMI and STAI A-state scores decreased within normal range. Although the decreased DHEA-S levels were not restored to the levels in postmenopausal women without climacteric syndrome, the C/D ratio decreased significantly after treatment with RG.", "Improvement of CMI and STAI scores in postmenopausal women suffering climacteric syndromes, particularly fatigue, insomnia and depression, by RG seemed to be brought about in part by effects of RG on stress-related hormones as shown by a decrease in C/D ratio."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. qw104765@nifty.ne.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tode", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kikuchi", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hirata", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kita", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nakata", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nagata", "ForeName": "I", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Int J Gynaecol Obstet", "NlmUniqueID": "0210174", "ISSNLinking": "0020-7292"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "459AG36T1B", "NameOfSubstance": "Dehydroepiandrosterone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-60-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone"}, {"RegistryNumber": "WI4X0X7BPJ", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrocortisone"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Adrenocorticotropic Hormone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Dehydroepiandrosterone"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrocortisone"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "psychology"], "DescriptorName": "Menopause"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Psychological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10659900", "10.1016/s0020-7292(99)00168-x", "S002072929900168X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
