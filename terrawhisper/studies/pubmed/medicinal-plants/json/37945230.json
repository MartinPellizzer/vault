It is worth noting that only analogs of 4 and 5 have been reported as natural products to date, while the nuclei of compounds 1-3, 6 and 7 were isolated for the first time in nature. Among them, compounds 1-3 bear an unusual anthra[2,3-b]furan-9,10-dione nucleus, 4 and 5 possess a rare 3-methyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl substituent, and 6 and 7 are new framework anthraquinones bearing a 6-methyl-1,7-dihydro-2H-azepin-2-one ring. Interestingly, the in vivo assays indicated that 1, 4 and 5 had inactivation effects against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) with inhibition rates of 41.6%, 55.4% and 38.6%, respectively, at a concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, which were better than that of the positive control agent, ningnanmycin (33.8%). Compounds 1, 4 and 5 also had protective effects with inhibition rates of 48.7%, 60.2% and 43.5% at the same concentration, while 4\u00a0had a better curative effect than ningnanmycin at a concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. In addition, mechanistic studies also revealed that a potent direct effect on TMV, the induction of SAR in tobacco plants, and the effective regulation of defense enzymes, defense genes, and defense hormones may be the reasons for the significant effects of 4 against TMV. At the same time, downregulation of the expression of total NtHsp70 protein by inhibiting the related Hsp70 genes may also be involved in tobacco resistance to TMV. To evaluate whether compounds have broader antiviral activities, the antirotavirus activities of new isolates were also evaluated and found to be highly effective with a therapeutic index (TI) value ranging from 11.6 to 17.7. This study suggests that the above anthraquinone compounds, particularly 4, have broad spectrum antiviral activities. The successful isolation and structure identification of the above anthraquinones provide new materials for the screening of anti-TMV agents and contribute to the improved utilization of N. tabacum-derived fungi."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.
