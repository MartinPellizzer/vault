Shufeng Jiedu capsule (SFJDC), a patented herbal drug composed of eight medicinal plants, is used to treat different viral respiratory tract infectious diseases. Based on its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities in acute lung injury, SFJDC can be effectively used as a treatment for COVID-19 patients according to the diagnosis and treatment plan issued in China and existing clinical data. SFJDC has been recommended in 15 therapeutic regimens for COVID-19 in China. This review summarizes current data on the ingredients, chemical composition, pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and potential therapeutic effect of SFJDC on COVID-19, to provide a theoretical basis for its anti-viral mechanism and the clinical treatment of COVID-19."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Yayun", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of food and biological engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Longfei", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inflammation and Immune Mediated Diseases Laboratory of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Feihu", "Initials": "F"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Drug Discov Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "101493809", "ISSNLinking": "1881-7831"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "shufeng jiedu"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "2"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["34980761", "10.5582/ddt.2021.01099"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
