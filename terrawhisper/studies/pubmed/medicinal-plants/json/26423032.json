The cannabinoids, i.e., cannabicyclohexanol (CCH: cis-isomer), trans-CCH, 5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[(1R,3S)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl]-phenol (CP-47497), 5-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)-2-[(1R,2R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-phenol (CP-55940), 3-(1,1'-dimethylheptyl)-6aR,7,10,10aR-tetrahydro-1-hydroxy-6,6-dimethyl-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-9-methanol (HU-210), 2-[1R-3-methyl-6R-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3-benzenediol (CBD), (1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenyl-methanone (JWH-018), (1-butyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1-naphthalenyl-methanone (JWH-073) and 1-(1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)-ethanone (JWH-250), were determined within 12 min using a conventional column (2-EP) for SFC. Furthermore, two optical isomers of CCH and trans-CCH were completely and rapidly separated by a chiral stationary phase column (AMY1). A highly sensitive detection (0.002-3.75 ppb) was also obtained by these methods using 2-EP and AMY1 columns. These methods were applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of cannabinoids in dried plant products. Although the concentration and species were different in the products, JWH-018, JWH-073 and CCH, including the cis-isomer, trans-isomer and the optical isomers, were detected in the products. Therefore, the proposed SFC-MS method seems to be useful as an alternative method to GC-MS and LC-MS for illegal drugs, such as cannabinoids."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory of Analytical and Bio-Analytical Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka."}], "LastName": "Toyo'oka", "ForeName": "Toshimasa", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kikura-Hanajiri", "ForeName": "Ruri", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)", "NlmUniqueID": "0377775", "ISSNLinking": "0009-2363"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cannabinoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Cannabinoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "10", "Day": "2", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26423032", "10.1248/cpb.c15-00170"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
