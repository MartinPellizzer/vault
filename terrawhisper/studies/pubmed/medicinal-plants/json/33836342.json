During the continuous study on PCPTs, this kind of triterpenoid ester is considered as a natural product with low toxicity because of it's widely distribution in natural plants and edible fruits including kiwi fruit, durian, jujube, pawpaw, apple and pear. In the present work, we report the isolation, structural elucidation and cytotoxic evaluation of four new PCPTs (1-4) which obtained from L. lolonum. In addition, the possible biosynthesis pathway for 28-norlupane triterpenoid and potent effect of phenylpropanoid moiety for increasing the cytotxic effect of triterpenoids were also discussed. Among these compounds, compound 1 exhibited the highest cytotoxic effect on HepG2 cells with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 11.87\u00a0\u03bcM. Further flow cytometry and western blot analysis demonstrated that 1 caused G1 cell cycle arrest by up-regulated the expression of phosphorylated p53 protein in HepG2 cells and induced cell apoptosis via MAPK and Akt pathways. These results emphasized the potential of PCPTs as lead compounds for developing anti-cancer drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
