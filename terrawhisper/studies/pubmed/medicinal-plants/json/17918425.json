The plantlets could produce from embryo directly and the shoots could be induced to form fasciculate buds through the callus differentiation. The green plantlets from embryo or fasciculated buds were used for rooting inducement. The experiment showed that the embryo pre-cultured at 4 degrees C and in dark for 7 days can germinate easier than at other cultural conditions; Treatment with low temperature and dark were favorable for growth of radicle and plumule and development of green plantlets; A single shoot could proliferate rapidly to form fasciculated buds by means of callus induction and differentiation; the optimal medium for growth and proliferate were MS + BA 1.0 mg/L + NAA 0.5 mg/L. With this method, the proliferous coefficient should be achieved 3.05."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang 621010, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Growth Regulators"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Light"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Growth Regulators"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Shoots"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Seedlings"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Temperature"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Culture Techniques"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "7", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17918425"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
