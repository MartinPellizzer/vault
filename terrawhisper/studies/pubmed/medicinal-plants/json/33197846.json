In the present work, the orthogonality in the selection of a biphasic solvent system for liquid-liquid chromatographic separation of aqueous extract and ether extract from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc was evaluated by the correlation coefficient and space occupancy rate. In total, 25 different biphasic solvent systems were tested, and 313 system combinations were analysed. A convex hull methodology was used to determine the separation space and to optimize separation conditions. The correlation coefficient matrix was transformed into dendrograms and a colour map to visualize the dissimilarity between, and orthogonality for, all solvent systems. The aqueous extracts from Polygonum cuspidatum were separated using selected biphasic solvent systems with high orthogonality: ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (70:1:70, v/v) and petroleum ether-ethyl acetate-water (1:5:5, v/v). The ether extracts from Polygonum cuspidatum were also separated using selected biphasic solvent systems with high orthogonality: petroleum-ethyl acetate-methanol-aqueous 0.25 M NH<sub>3</sub>\u2022H<sub>2</sub>O (5:5:5:5, v/v) and petroleum-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:5:5:5, v/v). Thirteen compounds were successfully obtained. The experimental results demonstrated that the evaluation of orthogonality provided an alternative strategy to select an applicable solvent system for the separation of complex samples using off-line two-dimensional countercurrent chromatography."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020.
