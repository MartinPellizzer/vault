In all plant species tested, the homologous serotype reactions showed high selectivity. Individual virus serotypes could be reliably detected in the extracts of infected plants only with the homologous IgG fraction. Group specific detection of RCNMV without serotype determination was possible using the mixture of IgG directed to all virus serotypes occurring in the region of investigation. Intensity of positive reaction of optimally diluted IgG with the extracts from infected plants differed markedly from that of negative reaction and from the reaction background. The latter depended on the quality of serum used for the IgG preparation. For detection of small amounts of RCNMV, virus infectivity test on indicator plants was more sensitive than ELISA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Virology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Czechoslovakia."}], "LastName": "Musil", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gallo", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Slovakia", "MedlineTA": "Acta Virol", "NlmUniqueID": "0370401", "ISSNLinking": "0001-723X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Immunoglobulin G"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antibodies, Viral"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immunoglobulin G"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "immunology", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Mosaic Viruses"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1683114"]}}]}
