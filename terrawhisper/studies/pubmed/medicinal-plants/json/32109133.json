The utilization of herbal compounds and complementary therapy for treatment of disease and addiction has been widely expanding. Considering the significant effect of Hab-o Shefa in detoxification phase, this clinical trial has explored the influence of this compound on maintenance treatment of opioid-dependent patients. This product is made of four herbs, including <i>Datura stramonium</i> L., <i>Rheum palmatum</i> L., <i>Zingiber officinale</i> Roscoe, and <i>Acacia senegal</i> L. <b><i>Design:</i></b> The authors conducted a two-group parallel randomized double-blind clinical trial on 81 opioid-dependent patients within 12 weeks. After medically assisted detoxification, participants were assigned randomly to Hab-o Shefa (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200941) and placebo (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200940). Outcome measures included craving assessed by craving beliefs questionnaire, self-reported opioid use, and lapse (any opioid-positive urine test) according to urinalysis and addiction severity index-lite questionnaire, retention in treatment, and depression and anxiety scores on the Hamilton's anxiety and depression scales. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Forty-one participants completed the study for 12 weeks, 21 subjects in the drug group and 20 subjects in the placebo group. The rates of opioid-positive urine tests and self-reported opioid use were significantly lower in Hab-o Shefa group (<i>f</i>\u2009=\u20098.41, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001). Hab-o Shefa also indicated a significant superiority over placebo in the effect of treatment by time interaction for craving (<i>f</i>\u2009=\u20095.91, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.001), depression (<i>f</i>\u2009=\u20093.40, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.01), and anxiety (<i>f</i>\u2009=\u20092.58, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.035). The retention time was 66.6 days for drug group and 59.6 days for placebo one. Although the causes for dropping out in two groups were different, there was no significant difference (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.623). The side effects of the two groups were not significantly different. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Results indicated that Hab-o Shefa could be useful for opioid maintenance treatment, and it can also be considered as a new promising drug for prevention of craving and relapse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Iranian Traditional Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moosavyzadeh", "ForeName": "Abdolali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Psychiatry Department and National Center for Addiction Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mokri", "ForeName": "Azarakhsh", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghaffari", "ForeName": "Farzaneh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological statistics and Epidemiology, School of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Faghihzadeh", "ForeName": "Soghrat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Azizi", "ForeName": "Hossein", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Jafari Hajati", "ForeName": "Razieh", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Research Center, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Naseri", "ForeName": "Mohsen", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Anxiety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Craving"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Depression"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Opioid-Related Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Persia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surveys and Questionnaires"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "11", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "2", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32109133", "10.1089/acm.2019.0390"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
