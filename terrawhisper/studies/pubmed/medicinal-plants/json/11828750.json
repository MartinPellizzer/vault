For the inter-species diversity, RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) analyses of genomic DNA were performed on the plants, belonging to the same genus or family and containing related compounds. Phylogenetic trees of lupin alkaloid containing plants and other medicinal plants, based on RFLP and/or RAPD profiles, showed the relationship between the diversities in genomes and secondary metabolisms. The chemotypes regarding anthocyanin production in Perilla frutescens var. crispa, were subjected to the study on intra-species diversity. The structural genes and the regulatory genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were isolated and their expression in red and green forms was determined by Northern blot analysis. The expression of all structural genes examined was co-ordinately regulated in form-specific manner and by light illumination. The anthocyanin production was enhanced in transgenic plants over-expressing Myc homologue genes from perilla. These results suggested that a protein complex including bHLH factors might regulate the expression of a series of structural genes. Additionally, cDNAs coding anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase and anthocyanidin synthase were isolated and characterized using recombinant proteins for the time. In conclusion, it was indicated that the molecular biological techniques are powerful tools for the investigation of diversity and regulation of and for the genetic engineering of secondary metabolism in medicinal plants."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Yayoi-cho 1-33, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8522, Japan. mamiy@p.chiba-u.ac.jp"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yamazaki", "ForeName": "Mami", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Plant"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Oxygenases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.-", "NameOfSubstance": "anthocyanidin synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "UDP-glucose anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genes, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genetic Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Oxygenases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Genetically Modified"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "NumberOfReferences": "36"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "9", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "2", "Day": "7", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11828750", "10.1248/yakushi.122.47"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
