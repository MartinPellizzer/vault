Alkaloids, the crucial components of medicinal Dendrobium, demonstrate beneficial healing properties in cardiovascular, cataract, gastrointestinal, and respiratory diseases. Members of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) gene family play essential roles in alkaloid synthesis, participating in alkaloid terpene skeleton construction and subsequent modifications. Although studies of the CYP family have been conducted in some species, genome-wide characterization and systematic analysis of the CYP family in medicinal Dendrobium remain underexplored. In this study, we identified CYP gene family members in the genomes of four medicinal Dendrobium species recorded in the Pharmacopoeia: D. nobile, D. chrysotoxum, D. catenatum, and D. huoshanense. Further, we analyzed the motif composition, gene replication events, and selection pressure of this family. Syntenic analysis revealed that members of the clan 710 were present on chromosome 18 in three medicinal Dendrobium species, except for D. nobile, indicating a loss of clan 710 occurring in D. nobile. We also conducted an initial screening of the CYP genes involved in alkaloid synthesis through transcriptome sequencing. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR showed that the expression of DnoNew43 and DnoNew50, homologs of secologanin synthase involved in the alkaloid synthesis pathway, was significantly higher in the stems than in the leaves. This result coincided with the distribution of dendrobine content in Dendrobium stems and leaves, indicating that these two genes might be involved in the dendrobine synthesis pathway. Our results give insights into the CYP gene family evolution analysis in four medicinal Dendrobium species for the first time and identify two related genes that may be involved in alkaloid synthesis, providing a valuable resource for further investigations into alkaloid synthesis pathway in Dendrobium and other medicinal plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024.
