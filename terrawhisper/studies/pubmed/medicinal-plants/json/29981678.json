In this regards, medicinal plants and natural products offer safe and inexpensive platforms for discovery of efficient and novel anti-viral agents. We have investigated the potential anti-viral activities of Veronica persica Poir.\u00a0 as a medicinal plant against herpes simplex viruses (HSVs). In vitro screening of the ethanol plant extract against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected Vero cells revealed the extract to show a dose-dependent inhibitory activity against both virus strains. After fractionation of the extract by a stepwise methanol gradient and evaluation of each fraction, the 80% methanol fraction displayed a pronounced inhibitory activity against the herpes viruses. The highest antiviral activity was observed when the Vero cells were treated with the extract both during and after infection by viruses. Moreover, the extract showed a prominent synergistic activity in combination with acyclovir anti-HSV therapy. Our findings revealed the potential of V. persica extract, especially its 80% methanol fraction, in inhibition of herpes simplex viral infections."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Phytochemistry Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Javad", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Milan State University, Milan, Italy."}], "LastName": "Iriti", "ForeName": "Marcello", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL 35899, USA."}], "LastName": "Setzer", "ForeName": "William N", "Initials": "WN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Parasitology, Zabol University of Medical Sciences, Zabol, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sharifi-Rad", "ForeName": "Mehdi", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Fasa University of Medical Sciences, Fasa, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roointan", "ForeName": "Amir", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical Ethics and Law Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Bahare", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)", "NlmUniqueID": "9216789", "ISSNLinking": "0145-5680"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4HES1O11F", "NameOfSubstance": "Acyclovir"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Acyclovir"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antiviral Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["virology"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorocebus aethiops"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "virology"], "DescriptorName": "Herpes Zoster"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 1, Human"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Herpesvirus 2, Human"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vero Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Veronica"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "4"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29981678"]}}]}
