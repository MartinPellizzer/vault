Symptoms on lower and middle leaves consisted of small circular spots, with light brown centers and reddish purple margins. Development of numerous spots (which grew larger) and, especially, damage to the midrib led to withering of leaflets. Conidiophores of the isolated fungus were dark, formed singly or in clusters, were unbranched with three to eight septa, and were 40 to 120 \u00b5m long. Conidia, produced in branched chains (four to six conidia or longer), were brown, globose, and ovate to pyriform with short beaks, contained four to five transverse and zero to two longitudinal septa, and were 36.6 to 46.6 \u00d7 10.0 to 13.3 \u00b5m. The fungus was identified as Alternaria alternata. Pathogenicity was confirmed by artificial inoculation of potted G. paniculata and Dianthus caryophyllus plants. Conidia (2 weeks old) produced on potato dextrose agar were sprayed on plants in a 5 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> suspension, and plants were incubated at 20 to 24\u00b0C in a moist chamber for 2 days. Lesion development in both plant species was observed and recorded at 4 to 5 and 6 to 7 days after inoculation, respectively. Lesions were most numerous on G. paniculata. This is the first report of A. alternata on baby's-breath in Bulgaria. References: (1) M. B. Ellis. 1971. Dematiaceous Hyphomycetes. Commonwealth Mycological Institute, Kew, U.K. (2) E. G. Simmons.
