The methanol extract from Fiatoua villosa among 100 traditional edible plants that were tested, showed the most potent inhibitory effect (51%) on acetylcholinesterase in vitro. After the sequential solvent fractionation of the methanol extract of Fiatoua villosa, the active fraction was repeatedly subjected to open-column chromatography on silica gel. From the highest inhibitory fraction, the chloroform fraction (75%) on AChE, the single compound, was obtained by the Sep-Pak Cartridge (C18: reverse phase column). This compound was finally purified by HPLC (micro-bondapack C18 reverse phase column: 19 x 300 mm). According to the electron impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS), we confirmed that the molecular mass was 219 m/z. The structure of this compound was identified as zeatin [2-methyl-4-(1H-purine-6-ylamino)-2-buten-1-ol], one of the derivatives of purine adenine. The concentration that was required for 50% enzyme inhibition (IC50 value) was 1.09 x 10(-4) M. This study demonstrated that the zeatin from Fiatoua villosa appeared to be the most potent AChE inhibitor in AD."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Ho-Jin", "Initials": "HJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Seong-Chan", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cho", "ForeName": "Hong-Yon", "Initials": "HY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hong", "ForeName": "Bumshik", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hye-Kyung", "Initials": "HK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Eun-Ki", "Initials": "EK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shin", "ForeName": "Dong-Hoon", "Initials": "DH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Mol Cells", "NlmUniqueID": "9610936", "ISSNLinking": "1016-8478"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7I6OOJ9GR6", "NameOfSubstance": "Zeatin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.1.1.7", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetylcholinesterase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetylcholinesterase"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Alzheimer Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "PC12 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Zeatin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "11", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "3", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11911460", "S1016-8478(23)15011-4"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
