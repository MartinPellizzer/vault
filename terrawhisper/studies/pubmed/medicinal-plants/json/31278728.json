(Euphorbiaceae) is commonly known as Indian Spurge Tree in English, and \"Saj Thor\" or \"Jhanami booti\" in local language. The plant is used traditionally in the treatment of various diseases like inflammation, fever, worm infection, asthma, cough, wounds and diabetes. In current study fresh as well as dried aerial parts of the plant and cut sections were examined, both macroscopically and microscopically. The study also deals with fluorescence analysis and phytochemical characteristics and other WHO recommended methods for standardization. WHO guidelines on quality control for medicinal plants materials were used for pharmacognostical evaluation of E. nivulia, phytochemical screening helps in determining the predominant classes of active constituents responsible for the activity. The present work will be helpful in identification of the fresh and dried samples of aerial parts pharmacognostically and anatomically. These studies will serve as a reference for correct identification and may be helpful in checking any type of adulteration. These observations will also help in differentiating this species from closely related species of the same genus and family."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Younus", "ForeName": "Muhammad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Karachi, Karachi, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Hasan", "ForeName": "Muhammad Mohtasheemul", "Initials": "MM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Rehman", "ForeName": "Muhammad Sajidur", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Baha ud Din Zakariya University, Multan, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Abbas", "ForeName": "Khizer", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Faculty of Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sarwar", "ForeName": "Ghulam", "Initials": "G"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Pakistan", "MedlineTA": "Pak J Pharm Sci", "NlmUniqueID": "9426356", "ISSNLinking": "1011-601X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Powders"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Euphorbia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mesophyll Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Components, Aerial"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "cytology", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Powders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "7", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "12", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["31278728"]}}]}
