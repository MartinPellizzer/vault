In this study, the effects of 19 naturally occurring prenylated flavonoids, isolated from medicinal plants, on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 and on 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and 12-LOX were investigated using [14C]arachidonic acid as a substrate. The homogenates of bovine platelets and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were used as COX-1, 12-LOX, and 5-LOX enzyme sources; the homogenate of aspirin-pretreated lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 cells was used for the COX-2 enzyme source. Among the 19 prenylated flavonoids, morusin, kuwanon C, sanggenon B, sanggenon D and kazinol B inhibited COX-2 activity (ic(50) = 73-100 microM), but the potencies were far less than that of NS-398 (ic(50) = 2.9 microM). In contrast, many prenylated flavonoids, such as kuraridin, kuwanon C and sophoraisoflavanone A, inhibited COX-1 activity. Of the COX-1 inhibiting prenylated flavonoids, kuraridin, kurarinone, and sophoraflavanone G, all having a C-8 lavandulyl moiety, showed potent activity (ic(50) = 0.1 to 1 microM) comparable to that of indomethacin (ic(50) = 0.7 microM). Most of the prenylated flavonoids tested inhibited 5-LOX activity with ic(50) values ranging from 0.09 to 100 microM. Of these, only kuwanon C, papyriflavonol A and sophoraflavanone G showed inhibitory activity against 12-LOX at low concentration ranges (ic(50) = 19-69 microM) comparable to that of NDGA (ic(50) = 2.6 microM). Our results suggest that the position and the nature of the prenyl substitution greatly influence in vitro biological activities of these molecules."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, 200-701, Korea, Chunchon, South Korea."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chi", "ForeName": "Y S", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jong", "ForeName": "H G", "Initials": "HG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "K H", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "H W", "Initials": "HW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "S S", "Initials": "SS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Biochem Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "0101032", "ISSNLinking": "0006-2952"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "27YG812J1I", "NameOfSubstance": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.13.11.12", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.99.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arachidonic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Platelets"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cattle"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Lipoxygenase"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Prenylation"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11705451", "10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00773-0", "S0006-2952(01)00773-0"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
