In contrast to previous reports utilizing spinach thylakoids, several transitions are reversible, and deconvolution of the calorimetric curves indicates nine transitions in both first and second heating scans, but overlapping transitions obscure at least three transitions in the first heating scans of control thylakoids. Glutaraldehyde fixation increases the denaturation temperature of several transitions which is consistent with a reported increase in thermal stability of thylakoid function due to fixation. Acidic pH treatment has little effect on the DSC curves, although it has been reported to have a significant effect on membrane structure. Separation of grana from stroma thylakoids indicates that components responsible for transitions centered at approximately 56, 73, 77, and 91 degrees C are predominantly or exclusively associated with grana thylakoids, whereas components responsible for transitions centered at approximately 63 and 81 degrees C are predominantly associated with stroma thylakoids. A broad transition centered at 66 degrees C is associated with grana thylakoids, whereas a sharp transition at the same temperature is due to a component associated with stroma thylakoids. Evidence obtained by washing treatments suggests the latter transition originates from the denaturation of the thylakoid ATPase (CF1). Analysis of the calorimetric enthalpy values indicates most components of the grana thylakoids denature irreversibly at high temperature, whereas components associated with the stroma thylakoids have a considerable degree of thermal reversibility."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratory for Biological and Chemical Sciences, Georgia State University, Atlanta 30302-4010."}], "LastName": "Nolan", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Hopkins", "ForeName": "H P", "Initials": "HP", "Suffix": "Jr"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kalini", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.6.3.14", "NameOfSubstance": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chloroplasts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Intracellular Membranes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Organoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proton-Translocating ATPases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1992", "Month": "8", "Day": "25", "Hour": "19", "Minute": "15"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1386214", "10.1016/0003-9861(92)90635-a", "0003-9861(92)90635-A"]}}]}
