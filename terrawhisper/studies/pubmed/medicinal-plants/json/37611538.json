Maternal-fetal outcomes associated with BV during pregnancy can be fatal for both the mother and the newborn.", "To identify maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant women with BV encountered globally, highlight their prevalence, and identify maternal-fetal outcomes associated with BV.", "The databases Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and Global Index Medicus were searched from inception until December 2022. No restrictions on time or geographical location were imposed when searching for published articles that examined maternal-fetal outcomes in pregnant women with BV. A random effects model was used to perform the meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger tests.", "In total, 26 of the 8983 articles retrieved from the databases met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Twenty-two maternal outcomes and 22 fetal outcomes were recorded among pregnant women with BV worldwide. This study determined the prevalence of maternal-fetal outcomes reported in three or more studies. Among fetal outcomes, preterm birth (PTB) had the highest prevalence [17.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 13-23.3%], followed by mechanical ventilation (15.2%, 95% CI 0-45.9%), low birth weight (LBW) (14.2%, 95% CI 9.1-20.1%) and neonatal intensive care unit admission (11.2%, 95% CI 0-53.5%). BV was associated with PTB [odds ratio (OR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.32-2.35], LBW (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.41-2.12) and birth asphyxia (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.13-7.46). Among maternal outcomes, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) had the highest prevalence (13.2%, 95% CI 6.1-22.3%). BV was associated with the following maternal outcomes: intrauterine infection (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.44-3.56), miscarriage (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.18-4.64) and PROM (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.39-4.82). Maternal and fetal outcomes were most prevalent in women whose BV was diagnosed using the Amsel criteria (37.2%, 95% CI 23-52.6%) and in the third trimester (29.6%, 95% CI 21.2-38.8%). Although reported in fewer than three studies, some maternal-fetal outcomes are highly prevalent, such as respiratory distress (76.67%, 95% CI 57.72-90.07%), dyspareunia (68.33%, 95% CI 55.04-79.74%) and malodorous discharge (85.00%, 95% CI 73.43-92.90%).", "BV has been associated with several adverse maternal-fetal outcomes around the world.
