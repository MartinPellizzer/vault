Excess Pb in Triticum sativum and Lens esculanta alters several physiological and biochemical processes in both species. Seed germination of both species grown on soaked filter paper with Pb (NO3)2 was highly inhibited (about 60% at 20 mM Pb (NO3)2). Results obtained from measurement of lead content in the roots and shoots of both species indicated that most of the lead accumulated in the roots of both species with a lower degree within the shoots. Lead uptake by both species whether grown in perlite medium or on filter paper soaked with Pb (NO3)2, was correlated with lead concentration. These results indicate a passive process of lead translocation. These results also show that lead inhibits the growth of both plant species, but root growth inhibition was more pronounced than shoot growth inhibition at different lead concentration. Total chlorophyll content was found to be decreased in both species after treatment with Pb (NO3)2. Total protein content in the seedlings, as our results have indicated, was found to be increased with increasing lead concentration in both species."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biological Sciences, Yarmouk University, Irbid, Jordan."}], "LastName": "Mesmar", "ForeName": "M N", "Initials": "MN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jaber", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Hungary", "MedlineTA": "Acta Biol Hung", "NlmUniqueID": "8404358", "ISSNLinking": "0236-5383"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1406-65-1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlorophyll"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2P299V784P", "NameOfSubstance": "Lead"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6E5P1699FI", "NameOfSubstance": "lead nitrate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chlorophyll"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Lead"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrates"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Development"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Species Specificity"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Triticum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1841484"]}}]}
