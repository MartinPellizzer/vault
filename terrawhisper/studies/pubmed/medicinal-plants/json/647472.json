Basic similarities were found in the nutritional requirement for the induction of nitrogenase activity (C2H2) in both organisms. In the absence of plant cell cultures both organisms need to be provided with a pentose sugar and a tricarboxylic acid to induce high levels of nitrogen-fixing activity. Plant cell callus tissue appears only capable of supplying the tricarboxylic acid to induce high levels of nitrogen-fixing activity. Plant cell callus tissue appears only capable of supplying the tricarboxylic acids needed but not the sugar component. The plant tissue, however, seems able to activate certain carbohydrates, which in themselves are incapable of substituting for the pentose additive."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Child", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kurz", "ForeName": "W G", "Initials": "WG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Canada", "MedlineTA": "Can J Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0372707", "ISSNLinking": "0008-4166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.18.6.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitrogenase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "In Vitro Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Nitrogenase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizobium"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Spirillum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1978", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1978", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["647472", "10.1139/m78-026"]}}]}
