To this day, they are part of medicinal teas or creams that help with the healing of skin wounds and the treatment of respiratory or intestinal infections. However, so far these plants have not been investigated more deeply than in their direct antibacterial effect.", "Our research is focused on adjuvants that inhibit the mechanism of antibiotic resistance or modulate bacterial virulence. Based on a preliminary screening of 52 European herbs, which commonly appear as part of tea blends or poultice. Six of them were selected for their ability to revert the resistant phenotype of nosocomial bacterial strains.", "Herbs selected for this study were obtained from commercially available sources. For the extraction of active compounds ethanol was used. Modulation of virulence was observed as an ability to inhibit bacterial cell-to-cell communication using two mutant sensor strains of Vibrio campbellii. Biofilm formation, and planktonic cell adhesion was measured using a static antibiofilm test. Ethidium bromide assay was used to checked the potential of inhibition bacterial efflux pumps. The antibacterial activities of the herbs were evaluated against resistant bacterial strains using macro dilution methods.", "Alcohol extracts had antibacterial properties mainly against Gram-positive bacteria. Of all of them, the highest antimicrobial activity demonstrated Malva sylvestris, killing both antibiotic resistant bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus with MIC of 0.8\u00a0g/L and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0.7\u00a0g/L, respectively. Fragaria vesca extract (0.08\u00a0g/L) demonstrated strong synergism with colistin (4\u00a0mg/L) in modulating the resistant phenotype to colistin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, the extract of S. officinalis (0.21\u00a0g/L) reverted resistance to gentamicin (1\u00a0mg/L) in S. aureus. However, Sambucus nigra and Matricaria chamomilla seem to be a very promising source of bacterial efflux pump inhibitors.", "The extract of F. vesca was the most active. It was able to reduce biofilm formation probably due to the ability to decrease bacterial quorum sensing. On the other hand, the activity of S. nigra or M. chamomilla in reducing bacterial virulence may be explained by the ability to inhibit bacterial efflux systems. All these plants have potential as an adjuvant for the antibiotic treatment."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
