Currently, treatment for cryptococcal meningitis is limited and new therapeutic options are needed. Historically, medicinal plants are used to treat infectious and inflammatory skin infections. Tryptanthrin is a natural product commonly found in these plants. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptanthrin had antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml against Cryptococcus species and of 8\u00a0\u03bcg/ml against Trichophyton rubrum. Further analysis demonstrated that tryptanthrin exerted fungistatic and potent antifungal activity at elevated temperature. In addition, tryptanthrin exhibited a synergistic effect with the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporine A against Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, our data showed that tryptanthrin induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase by regulating the expression of genes encoding cyclins and the SBF/MBF complex (CLN1, MBS1, PCL1, and WHI5) in C. neoformans. Screening of a C. neoformans mutant library further revealed that tryptanthrin was associated with various transporters and signaling pathways such as the calcium transporter (Pmc1) and protein kinase A signaling pathway. In conclusion, tryptanthrin exerted novel antifungal activity against Cryptococcus species through a mechanism that interferes with the cell cycle and signaling pathways.", "The natural product tryptanthrin had antifungal activity against Cryptococcus species by interfering cell cycle and exerted synergistic effects with immunosuppressants FK506 and cyclosporine A. Our findings suggest that tryptanthrin may be a potential drug or adjuvant for the treatment of cryptococcosis."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2020.
