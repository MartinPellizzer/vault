An ample number of clinical trials with multiple drugs is underway to overcome the current perilous condition. Still, the situation is alarming with no therapeutic measure in our hand at present. Keeping the present scenario in mind, this review comprises the research, clinical knowledge, and repurposed herbals with regard to COVID-19. Preventive measures such as yoga, nasal breathing, and herbal administration could also provide protection and beneficial effects against coronavirus. Innumerable clinical trials are ongoing to manage COVID-19 and the drugs were selected on the basis of life cycle of coronavirus. The selection of herbals was done on the basis of the previous reported pharmacological activities and docking study. The results concluded that garlic, liquorice, and Ashwagandha have a potential against SARS-CoV-2, which was further proved via a docking study and their reported biological functions. The very well-known fact \"prevention is always better than cure\" is applied to overcome with coronavirus infection. It is expected that following the preventive measures could impede or lessen the adverse effect of SARS-CoV-2."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Biochemistry Division, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Road, Timarpur, 110054 India."}], "LastName": "Rathor", "ForeName": "Richa", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Biochemistry Division, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Road, Timarpur, 110054 India."}], "LastName": "Suryakumar", "ForeName": "Geetha", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Biochemistry Division, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Road, Timarpur, 110054 India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Som Nath", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Biochemistry Division, Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Lucknow Road, Timarpur, 110054 India."}], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "Bhuvnesh", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol", "NlmUniqueID": "8501420", "ISSNLinking": "0731-8898"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Life Cycle Stages"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "SARS-CoV-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Yoga"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "COVID-19 Drug Treatment"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "17", "Minute": "4"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "2", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2021", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["33639071", "10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2020036207", "329baaac6708a7d0,174203c2156c4a2a"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
