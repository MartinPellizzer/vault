In this study, CeO2NPs were produced using Alhagi maurorum extract, and their anticancer and antibacterial activities were evaluated.", "Alhagi maurorum extract was prepared according to a previously described protocol, and CeO2NPs were synthesized from the salt of this extract. The resulting nanoparticles were characterized using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The antibacterial and cytotoxic effects of the nanoparticles were measured by MIC, MBC, and MTT assays, respectively. The results were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Prism software.", "The MTT assay on breast cancer cell lines showed that the cytotoxic effect of CeO2NPs on cell lines was concentration-dependent. In addition, this nanoparticle was more effective against Gram-positive bacteria.", "These nanoparticles can be used as cancer drug delivery systems with specific targeting at low concentrations in addition to anticancer treatments. It can also have biological and medicinal applications, such as natural food preservation and wound dressing."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9227-3473"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Advanced Technology, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Hosseini", "ForeName": "Sayedeh Azimeh", "Initials": "SA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khatami", "ForeName": "Mehrdad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences Medicine School Shahr-e Kord Iran."}], "LastName": "Asadollahi", "ForeName": "Amirkian", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Clinical Biochemistry Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran."}], "LastName": "Yaghoobi", "ForeName": "Hajar", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "12", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "27"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "3", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "30", "Hour": "2", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38685807", "10.2174/0118715206296523240424072939", "ACAMC-EPUB-140075"]}}]}
