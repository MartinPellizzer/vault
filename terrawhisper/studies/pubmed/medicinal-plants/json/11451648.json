Flavonoids, volatile oil and mucilage components are known as the active ingredients. In European Pharmacopoeia (EP), a simple thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) technique, which based on the analysis of the flavonoid composition was defined for the qualitative analysis of the drug. In this study, flavonoid composition in the flowers, bracts and leaves of the officinal species, Tilia platyphyllos were studied using a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique, in order to develop a rapid, reliable and accurate method for quantitative analysis. The results were further compared with in those parts of two common species growing in Turkey, Tilia rubra and Tilia argentea. Results of the present study revealed that flavonoid composition of each lime species possesses a specific fingerprint HPLC chromatogram depending upon the parts used and evaluation of the data might be helpful in the quality assurance as well as determination of adulteration of the crude drug."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Eczacilik Fak\u00fcltesi, Gazi Universitesi, Hipodrom, 06330 Ankara, Turkey."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Toker", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Aslan", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ye\u015filada", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Memi\u015fo\u011flu", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ito", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Pharm Biomed Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "8309336", "ISSNLinking": "0731-7085"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Assurance, Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "7", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11451648", "10.1016/s0731-7085(01)00351-x", "S0731-7085(01)00351-X"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
