Previous literature reports revealed that hydroxypyranone and hydroxypyridinone derivatives exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticonvulsant, and anti-diabetic activities. In this review, we systematically summarized the literature reported biological activities of hydroxypyranone and hydroxypyridinone derivatives. In particular, we focus on their biological activity, structure-activity relationship (SAR), mechanism of action, and interaction mechanisms with the target. The collected information is expected to provide rational guidance for the development of clinically useful agents from these pharmacophores."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
