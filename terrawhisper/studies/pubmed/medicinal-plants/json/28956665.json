Lagenaria siceraria is known for its antihyperglycemic, antidyslipidemic, antioxidant potential, and the present study was designed to explore the possible role of L. siceraria in attenuation of diabetic complications via in vitro modulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), sorbitol, and aldose reductase (ALR)-three major biomarkers of diabetic complications. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been carried out to explore L. siceraria to inhibit these biomarkers. Hydroalcohol extract of L. siceraria (LHA) was evaluated for its ability to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide radicals, total antioxidant capacity, and reducing-power assay. Antiglycation activity was carried out by bovine serum albumin (BSA) fluorescence method. Sorbitol accumulation was evaluated in red blood cells (RBCs) and ALR1 was obtained from kidney of rat to carry out the study. Quercetin was also quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis with 14.3\u00a0mg per 100\u00a0g of LHA. LHA exhibited 854\u00a0mg/g gallic acid equivalent of phenol content and 104\u00a0mg/g quercetin equivalent of flavonoids and was found to be significantly active against the antioxidant assays evaluated. LHA has shown 80.12% inhibition of AGE formation. LHA was found to be effective against sorbitol accumulation and ALR1 inhibition with IC<sub>50</sub> 198.25 \u03bcg/ml and 6.24 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. These results reveal that LHA may exert beneficial effects against diabetic complications by its antioxidant and antiglycation potential."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3089-3391"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Maharishi Markandeshwar College of Pharmacy , Maharishi Markandeshwar University , Mullana , Ambala , Haryana , India."}], "LastName": "Kajal", "ForeName": "Anu", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0183-0797"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Maharishi Markandeshwar College of Pharmacy , Maharishi Markandeshwar University , Mullana , Ambala , Haryana , India."}], "LastName": "Singh", "ForeName": "Randhir", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Diet Suppl", "NlmUniqueID": "101249830", "ISSNLinking": "1939-0211"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "506T60A25R", "NameOfSubstance": "Sorbitol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.1.1.21", "NameOfSubstance": "Aldehyde Reductase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Aldehyde Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cucurbitaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Complications"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Glycation End Products, Advanced"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Glycosylation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Kidney"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors", "blood", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Sorbitol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28956665", "10.1080/19390211.2017.1356419"]}}]}
