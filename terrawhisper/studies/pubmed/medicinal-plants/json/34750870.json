They are widely used as herbal remedies and consumed as food or beverages in folk medicine. However, little is known about their metabolic composition.", "The aims of this work were to determine the metabolic composition of and natural variation among different species of Chrysanthemum and to explore new potential resources for drug discovery and sustainable utilisation of wild Chrysanthemum.", "The metabolomes of Chrysanthemum mongolicum (Ling) Tzvel. and Chrysanthemum rhombifolium H. Ohashi & Yonek. were compared using a widely targeted metabolomics approach based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).", "In total, 477 metabolites were identified, of which 72 showed significant differences in expression between C. mongolicum and C. rhombifolium, mainly in flavonoids, organic acids and nucleotides. The flavone and flavonol biosynthesis pathway showed significant enrichment among the differentially expressed metabolites. The contents of genkwanin, trigonelline, diosmin, narcissoside, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, linarin, N',N'-p-coumarin, C-hexosyl-tricetin O-pentoside, chrysoeriol, acacetin and kaempferol-3-O-gentiobioside were significantly different between the two species and represent potential biomarkers.", "The types of flavonoid-related metabolites in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway differed between C. mongolicum and C. rhombifolium. The mechanisms underlying the unique adaptations of these two species to their environments may involve variations in the composition and abundance of flavonoids, organic acids, and nucleotides. These methods are promising to identify functional compounds in Chrysanthemum species and can provide potential resources for drug discovery and the sustainable utilisation of Chrysanthemum plants."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": ["0000-0003-0127-281X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Duan", "ForeName": "Xiaxia", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Wenjie", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jingjing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Hongyuan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life Sciences, Yangling, China."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Liang", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yueping", "Initials": "Y"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31872710", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "31770200", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytochem Anal", "NlmUniqueID": "9200492", "ISSNLinking": "0958-0344"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biomarkers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Biomarkers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Chrysanthemum"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"Reference": [{"Citation": "Saito K, Matsuda F.
