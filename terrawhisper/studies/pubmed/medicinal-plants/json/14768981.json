Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between sociodemographic, health status, and health behavior characteristics and the use of: 1) any herbal supplement; 2) Echinacea, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, or St. John's wort; and 3) at least 3 herbal supplements concurrently.", "Nearly one-sixth of US women took at least 1 herbal supplement in 2000. Logistic regression showed that women who were non-Hispanic white, aged 35 to 64 years, more educated, not poor, current alcohol users, residents of the South and West, and who had functional limitations and chronic conditions were significantly more likely to take the most commonly reported herbal supplements.", "Our study suggests high levels of herbal supplement use among US women. Supplement use is generally associated with higher education, higher income, residence in the South and West, and health needs. The growing practice of herbal supplement use suggests a need for public health guidance on the safe and efficacious use of these products."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Office of Data and Information Management, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yu", "ForeName": "Stella M", "Initials": "SM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ghandour", "ForeName": "Reem M", "Initials": "RM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Zhihuan J", "Initials": "ZJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Am Med Womens Assoc (1972)", "NlmUniqueID": "7503064", "ISSNLinking": "0098-8421"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged, 80 and over"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Echinacea"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ginkgo biloba"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Surveys"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Panax"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "United States"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Women's Health"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "6", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "2", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["14768981"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
