However, despite their widespread use, safety and quality issues have been major concerns in the world due to industrial- and anthropogenic-based heavy metal contamination risks. Thus, this study was attempted to analyze the heavy metal levels and mineral nutrient status of widely used medicinal plants in Turkey to have insights about their health implications on humans. The plant concentrations of B, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn were analyzed by ICP-OES in the leaves of 44 medical plants purchased from herbal markets of three different districts of Istanbul/Turkey. The measured lowest to highest concentrations were 0.065-79.749\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> B, 921.802-12,854.410\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Ca, 0.020-0.558\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Cd, 0.015-4.978\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Cr, 0.042-8.489\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Cu, 34.356-858.446\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Fe, 791.323-15,569.349\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> K, 102.236-2837.836\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Mg, 4.915-91.519\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Mn, 10.224-3213.703\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Na, 0.001-5.589\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Ni, 0.003-3.636\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Pb and 2.601-36.102\u00a0mg\u00a0kg<sup>-1</sup> Zn. Those levels in plants were in acceptable limits though some elements in some plants have high limits which were not harmful. Variations (above acceptable limits) in element concentrations also indicated that these plants could be contaminated with other metals and that genetic variations may influence accumulation of these elements at different contents. Overall, analyzed medicinal plants are expected not to pose any serious threat to human health."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Arts, Marmara University, Goztepe, 34722, Istanbul, Turkey. ilkozyigit@marmara.edu.tr."}], "LastName": "Ozyigit", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Ilker", "Initials": "II"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Arts, Marmara University, Goztepe, 34722, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yalcin", "ForeName": "Bahattin", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Arts, Marmara University, Goztepe, 34722, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Turan", "ForeName": "Senay", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Arts, Marmara University, Goztepe, 34722, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Saracoglu", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Adnan", "Initials": "IA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science and Arts, Marmara University, Goztepe, 34722, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Karadeniz", "ForeName": "Sedat", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Bahcesehir University, Besiktas, 34353, Istanbul, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Yalcin", "ForeName": "Ibrahim Ertugrul", "Initials": "IE"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning, Faculty of Architecture, Kirklareli University, Kayali, 39020, Kirklareli, Turkey."}], "LastName": "Demir", "ForeName": "Goksel", "Initials": "G"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "FEN-C-YLP-130612-0230", "Agency": "Research Foundation of Marmara University (BAPKO)", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biol Trace Elem Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7911509", "ISSNLinking": "0163-4984"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Minerals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Minerals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Turkey"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "21", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28726073", "10.1007/s12011-017-1070-7", "10.1007/s12011-017-1070-7"]}}]}
