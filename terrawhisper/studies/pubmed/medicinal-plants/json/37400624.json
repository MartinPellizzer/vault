Marine microorganisms often produce bioactive substances with novel functions and structures because of their special living conditions. Polysaccharides from marine microorganisms are of interest to new drug discovery.", "The current research focused on the isolation of bacteria from Red Sea, Egypt, that have the ability to produce a new natural exopolysaccharide in order to be examined in treating Alzheimer's illness to obviate side effects of synthetic drugs. Properties of exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by an isolated Streptomyces strain were investigated for its capability to play as anti-Alzheimer. This strain was identified morphologically, physiologically, and biochemically and actually was confirmed by molecularly 16S rRNA analysis as Streptomyces sp. NRCG4 with accession number MK850242. The produced EPS was fractionated by precipitation 1:4 volumes of chilled ethanol and the third major fraction (1:3) listed as NRCG4, and then the functional groups, MW, and chemical evaluation have been detected via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), high-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The findings showed that NRCG4 was an acidic EPS composed of mannuronic acid, glucose, mannose, and rhamnose in a molar ratio of 1.2:1.5:2.8:1.0, respectively. NRCG4 Mw was determined to be 4.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>5</sup> gmol<sup>-1</sup> and the Mn to be 1.97\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>5</sup> gmol<sup>-1</sup>. Also, the NRCG4 included uronic acid (16.0%) and sulfate (0.0%), but no protein was found. In addition, antioxidant and anti-inflammation activity was measured through various methods. This study confirmed that NRCG4 exopolysaccharide exerted anti-Alzheimer's characters via inhibition of cholinesterase and tyrosinase as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant abilities. Additionally, it occurred a potential role in the suppression of Alzheimer's disease risk factors through its antioxidant (metal chelation, radical scavenging capability), anti-tyrosinase and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The anti-Alzheimer's disease efficacy of NRCG4 exopolysaccharide may be assigned to its unique determined chemical composition.", "The present study highlighted those exopolysaccharides could be harnessed to improve pharmaceutical industry (anti-Alzheimer, anti-tyrosinase, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agents)."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
