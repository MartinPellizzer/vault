However, the mechanism by which this agent affects cells involved in the wound healing process is unknown. Cultured human keratinocytes were used in this study to investigate the effects of the Eupolin extract in vitro on processes involved in wound reepithelialization. Keratinocyte proliferation was monitored by a colorimetric assay and migration by the closure of a denuded area scratched in a confluent monolayer. Human keratinocyte proliferation was stimulated by low concentrations of the extract (from 0.1 to 5 microg/ml), cell differentiation by higher concentrations (50 to 300 microg/ml), and migration by intermediate concentrations (5 to 60 microg/ml). The increased proliferation and migration of human keratinocytes observed in vitro might explain, in part, the beneficial effects that have been observed in the clinic."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wound Healing Institute, The Churchill Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phan", "ForeName": "T T", "Initials": "TT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Hughes", "ForeName": "M A", "Initials": "MA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Cherry", "ForeName": "G W", "Initials": "GW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Wound Repair Regen", "NlmUniqueID": "9310939", "ISSNLinking": "1067-1927"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ointments"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analysis of Variance"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Division"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Movement"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dermatologic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Keratinocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ointments"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Probability"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Regeneration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sensitivity and Specificity"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "1", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "27", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11679139", "10.1046/j.1524-475x.2001.00305.x", "305"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
