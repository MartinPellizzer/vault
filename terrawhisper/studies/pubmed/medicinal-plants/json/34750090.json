Natural products provide diverse mechanisms of action and can be used directly or as prodrugs for further anticancer optimization. Despite the success, major bottlenecks can delay anticancer lead discovery and implementation. Recent advances in sequencing and omics-related technology have provided a mine of information for developing new therapeutics from natural products. Artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML), has offered powerful techniques for extensive data analysis and prediction-making in anticancer leads discovery. This review presents an overview of current AI-guided solutions to discover anticancer lead compounds, focusing on natural products from plants and associated microorganisms."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Inc.
