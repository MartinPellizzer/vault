Isochlorogenic acid A (ICAA), a phenolic acid found in a variety of natural sources such as tea, fruits, vegetables, coffee, plant-based food products, and various medicinal plants, exerts multiple effects, including protective effects on the lungs, livers, and intestines. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of ICAA against Pb-induced neurotoxicity in ICR mice. The results indicate that ICAA attenuates Pb-induced anxiety-like behaviors. ICAA reduced neuroinflammation, ferroptosis, and oxidative stress caused by Pb. ICAA successfully mitigated the Pb-induced deficits in the cholinergic system in the brain through the reduction of ACH levels and the enhancement of AChE and BChE activities. ICAA significantly reduced the levels of ferrous iron and MDA in the brain and prevented decreases in GSH, SOD, and GPx activity. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that ICAA attenuated ferroptosis and upregulated GPx4 expression in the context of Pb-induced nerve damage. Additionally, ICAA downregulated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expression while concurrently enhancing the activations of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, BDNF, and CREB in the brains of mice. The inhibition of BDNF, Nrf2 and GPx4 reversed the protective effects of ICAA on Pb-induced ferroptosis in nerve cells. In general, ICAA ameliorates Pb-induced neuroinflammation, ferroptosis, oxidative stress, and anxiety-like behaviors through the activation of the BDNF/Nrf2/GPx4 pathways."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
