M. marinum was selected as a model organism because it has a close phylogenetic relationship to M. tuberculosis, a relatively rapid doubling time, similar drug susceptibilities to M. tuberculosis, and less stringent safety requirements. More than 1000 crude marine and plant extracts were screened against M. marinum in a Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) assay, and twenty-one target extracts were identified. The crude organic extract of the marine sponge, Haliclona sp.10, was chosen for further investigation as it yielded a ZOI of 20 mm at a concentration of 80 microg/disk. Following bioassay-guided fractionation, (-)-papuamine was isolated, and yielded a 15 mm ZOI at a concentration of 25 microg/disk. In standard assays using M. marinum, (-)-papuamine exhibited both an MIC and an MBC95 of 6.25 microg/mL. This is the first report of antimycobacterial activity for (-)-papuamine. In addition, when (-)-papuamine and other natural product extracts were tested for activity against both M. marinum and M. tuberculosis, activity was comparable between the two species. These data indicate that (-)-papuamine is a promising lead for the development of new antimycobacterial agents and that M. marinum is a useful surrogate for the screening of antimycobacterial compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "University of Minnesota Medical School, Department of Anatomy Microbiology and Pathology, Duluth, MN, USA."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Barker", "ForeName": "Lucia P", "Initials": "LP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lien", "ForeName": "Benjamin A", "Initials": "BA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Brun", "ForeName": "Olivier S", "Initials": "OS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Schaak", "ForeName": "Damen D", "Initials": "DD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "McDonough", "ForeName": "Kathleen A", "Initials": "KA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chang", "ForeName": "Leng Chee", "Initials": "LC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Bacterial Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Mycobacterium marinum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seawater"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "8", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17534789", "10.1055/s-2007-981522"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
