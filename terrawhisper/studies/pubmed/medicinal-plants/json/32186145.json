Moreover, antioxidant potential was investigated by screening botanical extracts against 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging assay, phosphomolybdenum and total reducing power assay. While, disc diffusion method was used for determination of antifungal potential of all extracts against four pathogenic strains. Furthermore, brine shrimp cytotoxicity assay was conducted for cytotoxic potential and radish seed germination assay was carried out for estimation of allelopathic potential of plant extracts.", "Phytochemical evaluation showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids and saponins in almost all plants. In addition to significant antioxidant potential, Rubia cordifolia (ethanolic extract) revealed highest amount of phenolics and flavonoids. The said plant also exhibited good cytotoxic activity. Among plant extracts highest antifungal activity and allelopathic potential was recorded by Oxalis latifolia (ethyl acetate extract). Ethanol and ethyl acetate were observed to be the best choice of solvents. The best solvents-based results were obtained by Ethanol followed by Ethyl acetate and Benzene.", "For further studies, Rubia cordifolia and Oxalis latifolia are the most promising medicinal plants of Poonch valley, Azad Kashmir Pakistan at molecular level in order to isolate the compounds concerning with pronounced activities."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Farmeen", "ForeName": "Kiran", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Botany, Government Boys Degree College Hajira, Hajira 12160, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Muhammad Azam", "ForeName": "Khan", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Riffat", "ForeName": "Batool", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Zoology, University of Gujrat Sub-Campus Rawalpindi, Rawalpindi 46000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Sobia", "ForeName": "Kanwal", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pakistan Museum of National History, Pakistan Science Foundation, Islamabad, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Syed Lal", "ForeName": "Shah", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan."}], "LastName": "Tariq", "ForeName": "Mahmood", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "J Tradit Chin Med", "NlmUniqueID": "8211546", "ISSNLinking": "0255-2922"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Artemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pakistan"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology", "toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "3", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32186145", "2966"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
