Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of exploiting UV-B radiation to induce metabolic changes in fruit, vegetables, and herbs. The role of UV-B rays in inducing secondary plant metabolites is enhanced by new plastic films, which, as a result of their optical properties, permit the necessary dosage of UV-B to be transmitted into the greenhouse to stimulate such metabolites without altering the harvest.", "The main goal of the present paper is to demonstrate that, by using a greenhouse plastic film with appropriate transmittance of UV-B for rocket salad cultivation, it is possible to increase the nutraceutical elements in comparison with the same species grown in absence of such radiation. Tests compared nutritional elements extracted from rocket salad grown under greenhouses covered with several plastic films differing in UV-B transmittance. We found that rocket salad grown under plastic with 27% UV-B transmittance exhibited very high luteolin and quercetin content in comparison with rocket salad cultivated under film blocking UV-B radiation.", "Our experimental results confirm the possibility of exploiting UV-B radiation in the correct amounts by appropriate greenhouse plastic covers, to produce natural 'medicines' using the plants and to satisfy increasing consumer demand for natural health-promoting food products. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems, National Council of Research of Italy (CNR), Pozzuoli, Italy."}], "LastName": "Mormile", "ForeName": "Pasquale", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1993-4589"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Applied Sciences and Intelligent Systems, National Council of Research of Italy (CNR), Pozzuoli, Italy."}], "LastName": "Rippa", "ForeName": "Massimo", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3070-5389"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Graziani", "ForeName": "Giulia", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy."}], "LastName": "Ritieni", "ForeName": "Alberto", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Evaluation Study", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plastics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "KUX1ZNC9J2", "NameOfSubstance": "Luteolin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["instrumentation", "methods"], "DescriptorName": "Crop Production"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fruit"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Luteolin"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Plastics"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ultraviolet Rays"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "growth & development", "metabolism", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "Vegetables"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Schreiner M, Mewis I, Huyskens-Keil S, Jansen MAK, Zrenner R, Winkler JB et al., UV-B induced secondary plant metabolites - potential benefits for plant and human health.
