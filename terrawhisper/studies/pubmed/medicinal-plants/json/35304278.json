Plant extracts, selected based on their ethno-medical use, represent an important source of compounds for the development of novel candidate antiviral drugs. This especially concerns plants with ethnomedical records on their use in treatment of viral infections.", "To identify and document medicinal plants used by traditional health practitioners (THPs) for treatment of respiratory infections and muco-cutaneous lesions in order to study their antiviral activity including identification of active components and elucidation of mode of antiviral activity.", "The ethno-medical survey was performed in the Kagera region of Tanzania. The THPs were asked for plants used for treatment of signs and symptoms of respiratory infections and watery muco-cutaneous blisters in oral and genital regions. The plants identified were successively extracted with n-hexane, ethyl acetate and water, and the extracts assayed for anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), anti-herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and anti-human parainfluenza virus 2 (HPIV-2) activity in cultured cells. Antiviral components were separated by ethanol precipitation and CL-6B chromatography, and the mode of antiviral activity elucidated by the time-of-addition assay and selection for the virus variants resistant to antiviral plant extract.", "THPs identified fifteen plants used for treatment of respiratory infections and muco-cutaneous blisters. The water extract, but not n-hexane or ethyl acetate extracts, of six of these plants including Erythrina abyssinica stem bark, inhibited infectivity of two glycosaminoglycan-binding viruses i.e., RSV and HSV-2 but not the sialic acid binding HPIV-2. An activity-guided separation revealed that antiviral component(s) of water extract of E. abyssinica could be precipitated with ethanol. This sample potently and selectively inhibited RSV and HSV-2 infectivity in cultured cells with IC50 values of 2.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (selectivity index >476) and 0.14\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (selectivity index >7143) respectively. The sample exhibited inhibitory effect on the virus attachment to and entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particles. Indeed, 10 consecutive virus passages in HEp-2\u00a0cells in the presence of this extract selected for a resistant RSV variant lacking the attachment, viral membrane-associated, G protein due to a stop codon at amino acid residue 33 (Leu33stop). Fractionation of the E. abyssinica extract on a CL-6B column revealed that anti-RSV and HSV-2 activity correlated with carbohydrate content. The most pronounced antiviral activity was associated with a carbohydrate containing ingredient of molecular mass of <5\u00a0kDa, which may polymerize to antiviral composites of up to 410\u00a0kDa.", "Altogether, the water extract of six medicinal plants showed anti-RSV and anti-HSV-2 activities. Extended studies of the stem bark of E. abyssinica identified antiviral components that potently and selectively inhibited infectivity of free RSV and HSV-2 particles, a feature of importance in topical treatment of these infections. This observation confirms ethno-medical information concerning the use of E. abyssinica extract for treatment of respiratory infections and herpetic lesions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 The Authors.
