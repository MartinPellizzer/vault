Both women who had used herbal drugs in pregnancy and those not, had a positive attitude toward the use of herbal drugs in pregnancy. Echinacea was the most well known herb among both groups of women. The factors associated with the use of herbal drugs in pregnancy were: prior use of herbs, high knowledge about herbal drugs and age between 26 and 35 years. There was a non-significant higher frequency of herbal drugs use in pregnancy among women with a higher education level.", "The widespread use and positive attitude toward herbal drugs in pregnancy indicates an increased need for documentation about both the efficacy and safety of herbal drugs in pregnancy. Women between 26 and 35 years with a prior history of herbal drug use and high knowledge about herbs, are more prone to using herbal drugs in pregnancy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacotherapeutics, School of Pharmacy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. h.m.e.nordeng@medisin.uio.no"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Nordeng", "ForeName": "Hedvig", "Initials": "H"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Havnen", "ForeName": "Gro C", "Initials": "GC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand", "NlmUniqueID": "0370343", "ISSNLinking": "0001-6349"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Safety"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Self Medication"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Socioeconomic Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "3", "Day": "5", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "12", "Day": "18", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15603563", "10.1111/j.0001-6349.2005.00648.x", "AOG648"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
