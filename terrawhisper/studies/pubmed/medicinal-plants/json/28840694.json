Its counterfeits are often found in herbal markets, which are the plant materials with similar macroscopic characteristics of Tianma. Moreover, the prices of Winter Tianma(cultivated Tianma) and Spring Tianma(mostly wild Tianma) have significant difference. However, it is difficult to identify the true or false, good or bad quality of Tianma samples. Thus, a total of 48 Tianma samples with different characteristics(including Winter Tianma, Spring Tianma, slice, powder, etc.) and 9 plant species 10 samples of Tianma counterfeits were collected and analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS techniques. After optimizing the procedure of sample preparation, chromatographic and mass-spectral conditions, the HPLC chromatograms of all those samples were collected and compared. The similarities and Fisher discriminant analysis were further conducted between the HPLC chromatograms of Tianma and counterfeit, Winter Tianma and Spring Tianma. The results showed the HPLC chromatograms of 48 Tianma samples were similar at the correlation coefficient more than 0.848(n=48). Their mean chromatogram was simulated and used as Tianma HPLC fingerprint. There were 11 common peaks on the HPLC chromatograms of Tianma, in which 6 main peaks were chosen as characteristic peaks and identified as gastrodin, p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, parishin A, parishin B, parishin C, parishin E, respectively by comparison of the retention time, UV and MS data with those of standard chemical compounds. All the six chemical compounds are bioactive in Tianma. However, the HPLC chromatograms of the 10 counterfeit samples were significantly different from Tianma fingerprint. The correlation coefficients between HPLC fingerprints of Tianma with the HPLC chromatograms of counterfeits were less than 0.042 and the characteristic peaks were not observed on the HPLC chromatograms of these counterfeit samples. It indicated the true or false Tianma can be identified by either the similarity or characteristic peaks on HPLC fingerprint. Comparing the Winter Tianma with Spring Tianma showed that the HPLC chromatograms of 15 winter Tianma samples and 11 spring Tianma samples were similar at the mean correlation coefficient of 0.908. But the intensity of the characteristic peaks were different between the two groups of Tianma samples, i.e. the intensity of gastrodin, paishin A and C in winter Tianma was lower than those in spring Tianma. The Winter Tianma and Spring Tianma could be discriminated by either the Fisher unstandardized discrimination function or Linear discriminant function, based on the peak areas of 11 common peaks on HPLC chromatograms as variate."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Xiao", "ForeName": "Jia-Jia", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Hong", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Haisco Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Chengdu 611130, China."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "You-Cheng", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Ting-Wen", "Initials": "TW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yue", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Jing", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Chinese Materia Medica, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 610031, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xing-Guo", "Initials": "XG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jinkouhe Senbao Co., Ltd, Leshan 614700, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Da-Quan", "Initials": "DQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Standardization of Chinese Herbal Medicine in Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China."}], "LastName": "Lv", "ForeName": "Guang-Hua", "Initials": "GH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Discriminant Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrodia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Tubers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Seasons"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "2", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "8", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "7", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28840694", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20170331.001"]}}]}
