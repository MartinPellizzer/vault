The rats began to take the rats drugs in the fifth week after the operation. After 12 weeks of treat ment the rats were killed, and the bones were collected to inspect. The pathology of bone was observed with the HE stain and the area of trabecular was detected. The electronic testing device was used to detect the biomechanical properties.", "The results indicated that the rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) was a success. Compared with the model group, after application of the drugs, the observation of HE showed different repairing around trabecular. The biomechanical parameters also increased significantly.", "YFN can effectively prevent the loss of bone in OVX rats and strengthen bone quality, and has a good effect on PMO oostmenopausal osteoporosis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China. denghz@firm.mu.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Hong-Zhu", "Initials": "HZ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Liang", "ForeName": "Lei", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xu-Hui", "Initials": "XH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biomechanical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Bone Density"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Curcuma"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Femur"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Lumbar Vertebrae"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoporosis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ovariectomy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Oviducts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ranidae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16573005"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
