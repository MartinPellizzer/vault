The residual heterologous proteins in TCMIs may be one kind of the sensitized constituents. However, few methods were developed to identify and monitor the residual proteins of TCMIs in industry. Here, we described a method combining the advantages of ultrafiltration and mass spectrometry-based proteomics for monitoring the potential residual proteins in Re Du Ning injection (RDNI) intermediates and preparations. We identified and quantified both de novo peptides and the proteins matched against databases of three raw plants by using PEAKS software. Interesting, we found there was a significant decrease of peptides and proteins in No. 3-5 of RDNI intermediates and some even disappeared. Besides, we found this method could greatly reduce the interference of contaminants in proteomics experiments. The rapid and accurate method proposed in this paper could be used for monitoring potential residual proteins in TCMIs to guarantee their quality and safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021.
