The analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry after microwave digestion. The contents of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn in caps of mushroom samples were 0.7-7.2, 16.2-70.4, 371-1315, 12.5-29.8, 7.1-58.5, and 77.8-187.4\u00a0mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dry matter (dm), respectively, while considerable differences were found to be 1.8-25.9, 9.8-36.3, 288-6762, 13.3-103.9, 5.9-78.7, and 38.7-118\u00a0mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dm for stipes. The results indicated that higher levels of Co, Fe, and Ni were found in the mushrooms samples analyzed. Zinc and manganese levels were similar to previous reports, whereas Cu was lower than literature values. Correlation analysis suggested that significant correlations were found between the minerals determined and the greatest amount of contamination is associated with Co, Mn, Ni, and Fe. The results of this study indicate that heavy metal contents in mushroom species are mainly related to the mineral resources of sampling sites."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xuemei", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Yunnan Agricultural University , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Honggao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Yunnan Technical Center for Quality of Chinese Materia Medica , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Ji", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d College of Resources and Environment, Yuxi Normal University , Yuxi , China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tao", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Institute of Medicinal Plants, Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences , Kunming , China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Yunnan Technical Center for Quality of Chinese Materia Medica , Kunming , China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yuanzhong", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Sci Health B", "NlmUniqueID": "7607167", "ISSNLinking": "0360-1234"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Agaricales"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Basidiomycota"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Spectrophotometry, Atomic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "1", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "4", "Day": "25", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28121276", "10.1080/03601234.2017.1261545"]}}]}
