The Ayurvedic preparation in 57 patients was found effective in 64.9 per cent, while standard therapy (60 patients) was useful in 78.3 per cent. Patients on placebo (52 patients) showed improvement in 32.7 per cent only. Ayurvedic therapy was particularly beneficial in diarrhoea predominant form as compared to placebo. The standard therapy was more useful in the painful form of IBS as compared to placebo and Ayurvedic preparation. In gas predominant form the effect of standard as well as Ayurvedic therapy, was similar to placebo. Long-term follow-up (greater than 6 months) showed that both forms of therapy were no better than placebo in limiting the relapse."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Yadav", "ForeName": "S K", "Initials": "SK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jain", "ForeName": "A K", "Initials": "AK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tripathi", "ForeName": "S N", "Initials": "SN"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "J P", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Med Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0374701", "ISSNLinking": "0971-5916"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinuclidines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "clidinium compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6581-06-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Quinuclidinyl Benzilate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "6RZ6XEZ3CR", "NameOfSubstance": "Chlordiazepoxide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Chlordiazepoxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Colonic Diseases, Functional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Double-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinuclidines"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Quinuclidinyl Benzilate"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2697693"]}}]}
