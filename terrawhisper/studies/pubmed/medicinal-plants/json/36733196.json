Belamcanda chinensis (L.) DC has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine for multiple therapeutic purposes for a very long time. Belamcanda chinensis have been reported to have antipyretic, antidote, expectorant, antiphlogistic, and analgesic activity in the scientific fields. Scientific information on irisflorentin for its medicinal importance and pharmacological activity has been collected through electronic search engines, including Science Direct, Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus, and analyzed in the present investigation in order to know the biological potential of irisflorentin. However, analytical aspects of irisflorentin are also discussed in the present work. Further detailed pharmacological activity data of irisflorentin have been collected and analyzed in the present work in order to know the therapeutic potential of irisflorentin in medicine. Scientific data analysis of different research work signified the biological importance and therapeutic benefit of Belamcanda chinensis and irisflorentin in medicine. Scientific data analysis revealed the biological effectiveness of irisflorentin against Parkinson's disease, inflammation, cancer, and brain disorders. Further scientific data analysis also signified the biological potential of irisflorentin for its \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory potential and immunotherapeutic adjuvant in medicine. Metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters have also been discussed in the present work. Analytical data showed the importance of various analytical methods for separation, identification and estimation of irisflorentin in different biological samples. Scientific data analysis of various research works signified the biological potential and therapeutic effectiveness of irisflorentin in medicine. However, clinical data of irisflorentin should be also investigated in order to know their pharmacokinetic parameters and safety issue in medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India."}], "LastName": "Patel", "ForeName": "Dinesh Kumar", "Initials": "DK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United Arab Emirates", "MedlineTA": "Curr Drug Res Rev", "NlmUniqueID": "101735701", "ISSNLinking": "2589-9775"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antipyretics"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iris Plant"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Antipyretics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2022", "Month": "5", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "9", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "4", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "1", "Minute": "8"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["36733196", "10.2174/2589977515666230202123308", "CDRR-EPUB-129239"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
