This can further lead to oxidative stress, enhancement in level of ROS/RNS, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammations. Many clinical and preclinical trials have been conducted so far for the effective treatment of HD however, none of the drugs has shown complete relief. The regeneration of neurons is a very complicated process and associated with multiple pathological pathways. Hence, finding a unique solution using single drug that could act on multiple pathological pathways is really cumbersome. In the proposed hypothesis the use of demethyleneberberine (DMB) as a potential anti-HD agent has been explained. It is a metabolite of berberine and reported to act on multiple mechanistic pathways that are responsible for HD. Present article highlights new mechanistic insights through which DMB inhibits ROS/RNS, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neuroinflammation such as NF\u03baB, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8, cytokinin. Further its action on cellular apoptosis and neuronal cell death are also reported."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
