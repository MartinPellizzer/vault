The fungi were identified as 21 genera by morphology and ITS sequences. One dominant species was Phomopsis quercella in Hainan Tropical Botanical Garden and Bawangling Nature Reserve, with relative frequency of 42\u00b706 and 34\u00b788% respectively. Another dominant species was Colletotrichum boninense in Wuzhishan and Jianfengling Nature Reserves, with relative frequency of 36\u00b784 and 46\u00b797% respectively. Among the selected 21 endophytic fungi, 17 strains (80\u00b795%) had activity against at least one pathogenic bacteria, and 14 strains (66\u00b767%) exhibited activity against at least one fungal pathogens. Neonectria macroconidialis showed strong inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone being 20 mm), Bacillus subtilis (14 mm) and Streptococcus agalactiae (28 mm). Xylaria sp. showed strong inhibition against Escherichia coli (20 mm), Rhizoctonia solani (20 mm) and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (17 mm). Verticillium bulbillosum showed great activity against Strep. agalactiae (32 mm) and Fusarium oxysporum (22 mm). These endophytic fungi showed potentials in medicine development.", "Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants are an important source of novel and viable drugs. Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li is well known for leukaemia treatment and its endophytic fungi were isolated to investigate the diversity and antimicrobial activity. It was found that Ce. hainanensis Li had rich endophytic fungi, and some fungi showed strong antimicrobial activity against certain pathogens. These fungi can be used in medicine development."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 The Society for Applied Microbiology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "H R", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Hu", "ForeName": "X P", "Initials": "XP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "C J", "Initials": "CJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Y C", "Initials": "YC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Zeng", "ForeName": "Y J", "Initials": "YJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "C F", "Initials": "CF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "S X", "Initials": "SX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Lett Appl Microbiol", "NlmUniqueID": "8510094", "ISSNLinking": "0266-8254"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["classification", "drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Ascomycota"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Bacillus subtilis"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cephalotaxus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Colletotrichum"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endophytes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fusarium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Staphylococcus aureus"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "3", "Day": "13"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "6"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "18", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26280451", "10.1111/lam.12483"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
