Recent advances in the study of genomics and metabolomics in plant science have accelerated our understanding of the mechanisms, regulation and evolution of the biosynthesis of specialized plant products. We can now address such questions as how the metabolomic diversity of plants is originated at the levels of genome, and how we should apply this knowledge to drug discovery, industry and agriculture. Our research group has focused on metabolomics-based functional genomics over the last 15 years and we have developed a new research area called 'Phytochemical Genomics'. In this review, the development of a research platform for plant metabolomics is discussed first, to provide a better understanding of the chemical diversity of plants. Then, representative applications of metabolomics to functional genomics in a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, are described. The extension of integrated multi-omics analyses to non-model specialized plants, e.g., medicinal plants, is presented, including the identification of novel genes, metabolites and networks for the biosynthesis of flavonoids, alkaloids, sulfur-containing metabolites and terpenoids. Further, functional genomics studies on a variety of medicinal plants is presented. I also discuss future trends in pharmacognosy and related sciences."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science."}], "LastName": "Saito", "ForeName": "Kazuki", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Yakugaku Zasshi", "NlmUniqueID": "0413613", "ISSNLinking": "0031-6903"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfur Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Terpenes"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Arabidopsis"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Genomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Metabolomics"}, {"QualifierName": ["trends"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacognosy"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfur Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Terpenes"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "27", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29311454", "10.1248/yakushi.17-00193"]}}]}
