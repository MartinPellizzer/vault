During this study, 17 fungal species were isolated from root nodule samples taken from faba bean plants (Vicia faba L.) collected from different sites at Assiut area (Egypt). The growth of faba bean plants in pots was significantly promoted by soil inoculation with most fungi. Growth was checked in pots with inocula of Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium moniliforme, F: oxysporium, F solani, Macrophominia phaseolina and Rhizoctonia solani which were added separately. All growth-promoting fungi were capable of producing cellulase, pectin lyase, polygalacturonase, protease, urease, amidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and arylsulfatase in growth medium supplemented with the corresponding substrates. Four fungal species, Aspergillus awamori, A. flavus, Penicillium chrysogenum and Trichoderma koningii showed the highest rates of enzyme formation. The effect of the addition of six trace elements to the growth media at 30 micromol/ml on enzyme production revealed some dependency on species, enzyme and metal ion. Cd2+, Hg2+ and Zn2+ generally inhibited enzyme activity. Cu(1+), Fe3+ and Al3+ showed a stimulatory effect. Fungicides (afugan and tilt) and herbicides (brominal and fusilade) at 50 ppm generally promoted enzyme activity, but insecticides (kelthane and fenvalerate) caused some inhibition to enzyme activities. Salinization of the growth media with NaCl strongly inhibited the enzymatic activity of all fungi at concentrations between 0.5 and 1.5%."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, Faculty of Science, Assiut University, Egypt. saomar@aun.eun.eg"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Omar", "ForeName": "S A", "Initials": "SA"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abd-Alla", "ForeName": "M H", "Initials": "MH"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Microbiol Res", "NlmUniqueID": "9437794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-5013"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Herbicides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pesticides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trace Elements"}, {"RegistryNumber": "451W47IQ8X", "NameOfSubstance": "Sodium Chloride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["growth & development", "microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "enzymology", "isolation & purification", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Fungicides, Industrial"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Herbicides"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Pesticides"}, {"QualifierName": ["microbiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Trace Elements"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "6", "Day": "24", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "4", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10772156", "10.1016/S0944-5013(00)80008-7", "S0944-5013(00)80008-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
