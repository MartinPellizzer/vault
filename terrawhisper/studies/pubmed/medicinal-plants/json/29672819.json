Recently, it has been included in European Pharmacopoeia as one of the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. In this study, a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography method with diode array detector and time-of-flight mass spectrometry was developed and validated for the profiling of rhizomes from European invasive populations and <i>Polygoni cuspidati rhizoma</i> purchased in China. Twenty-five compounds were identified, mainly stilbenes, anthraquinones, flavan-3-ols, and phenylpropanoid esters. Tatariside B, hydropiperoside, vanicoside C, a new compound (3,6-O-di-<i>p</i>-coumaroyl)-<i>\u03b2</i>-fructofuranosyl-(2\u2009\u2192\u20091)-(2'-O-acetyl-6'-O-feruloyl)-<i>\u03b2</i>-glucopyranoside) were reported for the first time in these raw materials. Six compounds from three phytochemical classes-stilbenes: piceid and resveratrol; anthraquinones: emodin and physcion; hydroxycinnamic sucrose esters: vanicosides A and B-were quantified using the validated method. <i>R.\u00a0japonica</i> from China contained twice as many stilbenoids than samples from Poland (piceid 14.83\u2009mg/g dm vs. 7.45\u2009mg/g and resveratrol 1.29\u2009mg/g vs. 0.65\u2009mg/g). <i>R.\u00a0sachalinensis</i> rhizomes contained lower quantities of anthraquinones and no detectable stilbenes, which together with higher amounts of hydroxycinnamic glycosides makes it easily distinguishable from the other two.
