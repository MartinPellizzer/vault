RS from cooked (atmospheric pressure) white beans was quantified in humans and pigs, and characterized to explain its low digestibility. Six human volunteers were intubated to collect ileal digesta after an experimental meal composed of orange juice, butter and 167 g beans (dry matter basis). The reliability of the intubation method was examined in a pig study in which it was compared with another collection method, ileal cannulation. Chemical analyses, microscopy and size exclusion chromatography were performed on human and pig digesta. The pig study showed that the intubation method may underestimate the quantity of RS. However, no chemical/physical difference was observed between the RS collected by the two techniques. In the human study, 16.5 +/- 1.3% (11.3 g) of the ingested starch was recovered as RS. The microscopy of the digesta showed that part of the RS was enclosed in the cell walls. Although the RS was composed mainly of alpha-glucan molecules with a degree of polymerization (DP) 40 to 60, oligosaccharides and large molecules of DP > 400 were also present. Retrogradation was not found to be the main factor responsible for starch malabsorption. We conclude that white beans may contain a large amount of RS formed mainly by partially degraded molecules protected by the cell walls during their transit through the gut."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Laboratoire de Technologie Appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la Nutrition, Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, BP 71627, 44316 Nantes C\u00e9dex 03, France."}], "LastName": "Noah", "ForeName": "L", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Guillon", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bouchet", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bul\u00e9on", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Molis", "ForeName": "C", "Initials": "C"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gratas", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Champ", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Nutr", "NlmUniqueID": "0404243", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3166"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucans"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-25-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Starch"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Carbohydrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gastrointestinal Contents"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Glucans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ileum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Starch"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1998", "Month": "6", "Day": "18", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9614157", "10.1093/jn/128.6.977"]}}]}
