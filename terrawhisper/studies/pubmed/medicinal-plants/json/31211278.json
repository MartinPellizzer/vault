The aim of the present animal study was to compare the effect of different types of honey on the lipid profile in diabetic rats.", "Sixty-four male Wistar rats were divided into two main groups: a streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) group (including four subgroups) and a healthy group (including four subgroups), based on random allocation. Three subgroups of each main group were given 1 mg/kg of three different types of honey (acacia, astragalus, and artificial honey) by oral gavage for 10 weeks. The control groups were given distilled water. Blood samples were collected, and the lipid profile was measured and compared between the eight groups after the intervention.", "The levels of LDL, triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol (Tchol) in DM rats treated with astragalus honey were significantly lower and the HDL level was significantly higher compared to the other DM and healthy groups (all <i>p</i>-values < 0.05). LDL, TG, and Tchol levels in DM rats treated with artificial honey were significantly higher, and HDL levels were significantly lower than for other types of honey and for the control groups (all <i>p</i>-values < 0.05). LDL, HDL, TG, and Tchol levels in healthy rats were not significantly different between the groups (<i>p</i>-value > 0.05).", "Different types of honey (acacia, astragalus, and artificial honey) had various effects on serum lipid profiles in diabetic rats. The results of this study indicated that the effect of honey on diabetic patients can vary widely based on its source."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Department, School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadimanesh", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Department, School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Vahidiniya", "ForeName": "Ali Asghar", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Centre of Health and Environment, Guilan University of Medical Sciences, Rasht, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products and Medicinal Plants Research Centre, North Khorasan University of Medical Sciences, Bojnurd, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Cancer Research Centre, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doaei", "ForeName": "Saeid", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee, Cancer Research Centre, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Gholamalizadeh", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Faculty of Nutrition Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahvegharasl", "ForeName": "Zahra", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nauru Sciences Research Centre, Hamedan University of medical sciences, Hamedan, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salehi", "ForeName": "Iraj", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Fayyaz", "ForeName": "Nasrin", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Nutrition Department, School of Public Health, Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran."}], "LastName": "Khosravi", "ForeName": "Hassan Mozzaffari", "Initials": "HM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "101701205", "ISSNLinking": "2451-0629"}, "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Mathers CD, Loncar D.
