However, nothing is known about the role of the host metabolic genes in oral cancer in ethnic Indian population. In this study, the prevalence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes (GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2) in oral premalignant leukoplakia cases and controls was ascertained in genomic DNA by a multiplex PCR technique. Biopsies taken from 98 oral leukoplakia patients and exfoliated cells from 82 healthy controls both of Indian ethnicity were analysed. GSTM1*1 (active) was present in 83% and GSTT1*1 (active) was present in 78% of all control subjects, while prevalence of GSTM1*2 and GSTT1*2 null genotypes was significantly higher among oral leukoplakia cases. The prevalence of GSTM1*2 in leukoplakia cases was 81.6% compared with 17% in controls [odds ratio (OR), 22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1047] and GSTT1*2 was 75.5% in the cases versus 22% in controls (OR, 11; 95% CI, 5-22). Combined null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 prevailed in 60.2% of the cases with none detected in controls. Glutathione S-transferase M1 and T1 enzymes are both known to catalyse detoxification of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation products and tobacco-derived carcinogens that have been found in the saliva of BQ/tobacco chewers. Our results, still requiring confirmation by a larger study, demonstrate that the null genotypes of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 increase with high penetrance, separately or in combination, the risk for developing leukoplakia in an Indian ethnic population."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Toxicology and Cancer Risk Factors, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg."}], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "U J", "Initials": "UJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Nair", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mathew", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bartsch", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Carcinogenesis", "NlmUniqueID": "8008055", "ISSNLinking": "0143-3334"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "DNA, Neoplasm"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gene Frequency"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genotype"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "epidemiology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Leukoplakia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "epidemiology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Mouth Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Prevalence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10334189", "10.1093/carcin/20.5.743"]}}]}
