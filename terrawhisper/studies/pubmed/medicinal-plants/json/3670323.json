Chromosome damage produced by both S-dependent (maleic hydrazide, methyl methanesulfonate, thio-TEPA) and S-independent (X-rays, streptonigrin) mechanisms was enhanced by the inhibitor treatments. The types of aberrations affected by the inhibitors were mainly chromatid gaps and breaks and isochromatid breaks of the non-union type. Most effective among the inhibitors tested were hydroxyurea (HU) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd). Post-treatments with caffeine were effective in enhancing clastogen-induced chromosome damage when given during the S phase. All types of aberrations, exchanges as well as breaks, were enhanced by the post-treatments. When given during the G2 phase, caffeine enhanced only the frequency of chromatid aberrations produced by X-rays. The enhancement was slight and obtained only when the cells were irradiated in the G2 phase and immediately post-treated with caffeine. Clastogen-treated cultures of human lymphocytes responded to post-treatments with inhibitors of DNA synthesis in very much the same way as clastogen-treated root-tip cells of Vicia faba. Thus, the frequencies of chromatid gaps and breaks and isochromatid breaks of the non-union type were strongly enhanced by exposing clastogen-treated lymphocytes to inhibitors of DNA synthesis during the G2 phase. The efficiency of the inhibitors, however, varied considerably in the two materials. On the whole, the number of inhibitors capable of enhancing induced chromosome damage was much larger in lymphocytes than in bean root tips. Only HU was equally effective in both materials. The most striking difference between the two materials was found when caffeine was given as a post-treatment. Thus, in human lymphocytes the frequencies of chromatid aberrations induced by most clastogenic agents were strongly enhanced when caffeine was given during the G2 phase, but little affected by post-treatments with caffeine during the S phase."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, University of Uppsala, Sweden."}], "LastName": "Andersson", "ForeName": "H C", "Initials": "HC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kihlman", "ForeName": "B A", "Initials": "BA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Mutat Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0400763", "ISSNLinking": "0027-5107"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Mutagens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3G6A5W338E", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects", "ultrastructure"], "DescriptorName": "Chromosomes"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "radiation effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Repair"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Replication"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Interphase"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mammals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Mutagens"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "X-Rays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1987", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3670323", "10.1016/0027-5107(87)90297-1", "0027-5107(87)90297-1"]}}]}
