This study was a single centre, single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, in which 60 women with microbiology-confirmed vulvovaginal candidiasis were randomly assigned to dill and clotrimazole groups. At the end of the study, the estimated prevalence of leucorrhoea, burning, and itching was 23%, 23% and 20% in dill users, respectively. This figure was 20%, 10% and 16.7% for the clotrimazole group, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not significant. 13% of suppository patients, compared with 10% of clotrimazole-treatment patients, had a positive culture, which was not significant (p\u2009=\u2009.68). According to findings, 2% dill vaginal suppositories were as effective as clotrimazole vaginal tablets in reducing both clinical and microbiological symptoms of Candidiasis. Studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm current findings. Impact statement What is already known on the subject? Based on results from in vivo and in vitro animal studies, dill (Anethum graveolens) has anti-candida activity. What do the results of this study add? It appears that 2% dill vaginal suppositories were as effective as 100\u2009mg clotrimazole vaginal tablets in reducing both the clinical and microbiological symptoms. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and further research? Obstetricians and gynaecologists can offer dill as a useful alternative to chemical drugs, especially in women who are often interested in herbal medicine, or in women who are resistant or are not allowed to use antifungal drugs."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Saghafi", "ForeName": "Nafiseh", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Karjalian", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Evidence-Based Care Research Centre, Mashhad University of Medical Science , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghazanfarpour", "ForeName": "Masumeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Parasitology and Mycology , Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khorsand", "ForeName": "Imaneh", "Initials": "I"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e School of Medicine , Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Rakhshandeh", "ForeName": "Hassan", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirteimouri", "ForeName": "Masumeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences , Semnan , Iran."}], "LastName": "Babakhanian", "ForeName": "Masoudeh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Evidence-Based Care Research Centre, Mashhad University of Medical Science , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Khadivzadeh", "ForeName": "Talat", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "g Department of Parasitology and Mycology Faculty of Medicine , Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Najafzadeh", "ForeName": "Mohammad Javad", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "h Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Ghorbani", "ForeName": "Ahmad", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology , Mashhad University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Pourali", "ForeName": "Leila", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "i Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Mashhad , Iran."}], "LastName": "Bahman", "ForeName": "Sara", "Initials": "S"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Obstet Gynaecol", "NlmUniqueID": "8309140", "ISSNLinking": "0144-3615"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}, {"RegistryNumber": "G07GZ97H65", "NameOfSubstance": "Clotrimazole"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Intravaginal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anethum graveolens"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Clotrimazole"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Iran"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pruritus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Single-Blind Method"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Young Adult"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "24", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29553834", "10.1080/01443615.2018.1432578"]}}]}
