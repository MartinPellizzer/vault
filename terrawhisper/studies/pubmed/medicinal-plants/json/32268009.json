The objective of this study was to examine the impact of malvidin on inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in PBMCs as caused by LPS. The present findings showed that LPS significantly increased the expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and COX-2 mRNA and protein release from PBMCs 22\u2009hr after treatments. It was also revealed that increased levels in cytokine expression coincided with increased phosphorylation of JNK, P65-NF-\u03baB, and IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2. Also, the expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and COX-2 mRNA induced by LPS as well as secretion of protein in PBMC has been significantly decreased by pretreatment of malvidin. Importantly, pretreatment of the cells with malvidin completely abrogated the phosphorylation of P65-NF-\u03baB, JNK, and IKK\u03b1/IKK\u03b2 in LPS treated cells. Malvidin protection against LPS-induced inflammation was coupled with a decline in the levels of nitric oxide metabolite and malondialdehyde, along with an increase in the ferric reducing antioxidant power, total thiol activity, and also superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. In accordance with this finding, malvidin may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention of inflammation in PBMCs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Bastin", "ForeName": "Ali R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Sadeghi", "ForeName": "Asie", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abolhassani", "ForeName": "Moslem", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9166-419X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Doustimotlagh", "ForeName": "Amir H", "Initials": "AH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Afzalipour School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mohammadi", "ForeName": "Abbas", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "IUBMB Life", "NlmUniqueID": "100888706", "ISSNLinking": "1521-6543"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anthocyanins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytokines"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "10463-84-0", "NameOfSubstance": "malvidin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Anthocyanins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytokines"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Inflammation"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes, Mononuclear"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipopolysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Kanterman J, Sade-Feldman M, Baniyash M, editors.
