These subjects were 35 males, 20 to 69 years and 7 females 22 to 78 years. For the patients who had constitutionally infirm stomach and intestines the rate of effectiveness reached 41%, which was rather satisfactory. For the other patients, however, it was only 28%. Besides no correlation was observed between the age of patient and the effectiveness. A combined administration of antibiotics and antibacterial agents led to no increase in the effectiveness. All of the side effects were rather slight, which permitted its continuous administration over a period of more than 4 weeks. From the above findings Seishinrenshiin was expected to be both effective for the patients who have constitutionally infirm stomach and intestines and can be used safely."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Terada", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ishikawa", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Katayama", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Hinyokika Kiyo", "NlmUniqueID": "0421145", "ISSNLinking": "0018-1994"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chronic Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, East Asian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Prostatitis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urethritis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Urination Disorders"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1985", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["4061223"]}}]}
