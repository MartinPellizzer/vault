(commonly known as mugwort) were tested for their effects on tissue damage brought about by ischemia-reperfusion injury in the rat mesentery. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 200-300 grams in weight were divided into two groups, control and treatment (AV) group. All rats were anesthetized with ketamine HCl administered intramuscularly, tracheotomized and cannulated in one carotid artery and one jugular vein. After a midline abdominal incision, the mesenteric area was exteriorized and observed using videomicroscopy. After baseline observations of systemic blood pressure, heart rate, venular diameters and leukocyte adhesion along venules, the mesenteric artery and vein were occluded for 10 minutes. Prior to occlusion, A. vulgaris-treated animals were given a bolus injection of a 1% w/v solution of extracts, while the control group received saline. Monastral Blue dye was also administered before the occlusion at a dose of 30 mg/kg via the jugular vein in order to assess transendothelial leakage. Hemodynamic and cellular parameters were measured immediately after the release of occlusion and at 10 minute intervals thereafter. Results show that the extracts had no significant effects on mean blood pressures and heart rates, but appeared to significantly reduce leukocyte adherence and transendothelial leakage while improving flow in the ischemia-reperfused organ. The extract fractions contain yomogin, which has been previously shown to inhibit iNOS activity, and may therefore explain the anti-inflammatory property of the plant."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, University of the Philippines Manila, Ermita. xtigno@i-next.net"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tigno", "ForeName": "X T", "Initials": "XT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gumila", "ForeName": "E", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Clin Hemorheol Microcirc", "NlmUniqueID": "9709206", "ISSNLinking": "1386-0291"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "1,2,3,4-diepoxy-11(13)-eudesmen-12,8-olide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Hexanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lactones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "yomogin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "059QF0KO0R", "NameOfSubstance": "Water"}, {"RegistryNumber": "2DDG612ED8", "NameOfSubstance": "n-hexane"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.14.13.39", "NameOfSubstance": "Nos2 protein, rat"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisia"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Pressure"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Leak Syndrome"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Adhesion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Heart Rate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Hemodynamics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hexanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood supply"], "DescriptorName": "Intestines"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Ischemia"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Lactones"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Leukocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Vascular Occlusion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microscopy, Video"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "physiopathology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Reperfusion Injury"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes, Eudesmane"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Splanchnic Circulation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Water"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "9", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "4", "Day": "26", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11321436"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
