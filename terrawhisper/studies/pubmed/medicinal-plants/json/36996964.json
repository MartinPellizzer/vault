The optimum ch/SKEO NE with mean droplet size of 68\u00a0nm was attained at 1.97, 1.23, and 0.10%w/w of surfactant, essential oil and chitosan, using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Applying microfluidic platform, the ch/SKEO NE resulted in improved antibacterial activity owing to the modification of surface properties. The nanoemulsion samples showed a significant rupturing effect on the E. coli bacterial cell membrane which resulted in a rapid release of cellular contents. This action was remarkably intensified by executing microfluidic chip in parallel to the conventional method. Having treated the bacteria in the microfluidic chip for 5\u00a0min with a 8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL concentration of ch/SKEO NE, the bacterial integrity disrupted quickly, and the activity was totally lost in a 10-min period at 50 \u03bcglmL, while it took 5\u00a0h for a complete inhibition in the conventional method using the same concentration of ch/SKEO NE. It can be concluded that nanoemulsification of EOs using chitosan coating can intensify the interaction of nanodroplets with the bacterial membrane, especially within the microfluidic chips which provides high contact surface area."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
