Apoptotic cells were detected using Hoechst33342 staining, and confirmed by DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis. The activity of caspase-3 was measured with special assay kit. The concentration of free intracellular calcium was determined with the probe Indo-1 by spectrometer. The level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the potential of mitochondrial membrane were determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) combined with fluorescence probe H2DCFDA or JC-1 respectively.", "SH-SY5Y cells treated with TNFalpha 100 microg/L for 36 h showed typical morphological changes of apoptosis. DNA ladder could be observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The highest percentage of apoptotic cells accumulated to 37.5 %. Following 36 h treatment with TNFalpha, accumulation of intracellular ROS and [Ca2+]i and decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential were observed, and caspase-3 activity increased by about five-fold compared with controls. However, pretreatment with tubuloside B (1, 10, or 100 mg/L) for 2 h attenuated the TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis. The antiapoptotic action of tubuloside B was partially dependent on an anti-oxidative stress effects, maintain of mitochondria function, decrease of concentration of free intracellular calcium and inhibition of caspase-3 activity.", "Tubuloside B has the neuroprotective capacity to antagonize TNFalpha-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells and may be useful in treating some neurodegenerative diseases."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright 2004 Acta Pharmacologica Sinica"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center of Occupational Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100083, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Deng", "ForeName": "Min", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Jin-Yuan", "Initials": "JY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ju", "ForeName": "Xiao-Dong", "Initials": "XD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jiang", "ForeName": "Yong", "Initials": "Y"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Zheng-Bin", "Initials": "ZB"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Acta Pharmacol Sin", "NlmUniqueID": "100956087", "ISSNLinking": "1671-4083"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tubuloside B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "CASP3 protein, human"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspase 3"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.22.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Caspases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "SY7Q814VUP", "NameOfSubstance": "Calcium"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Calcium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Caspase 3"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Caspases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cell Line, Tumor"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cistanche"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA Fragmentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mitochondria"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroblastoma"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Neuroprotective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Reactive Oxygen Species"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15456528"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
