Due to high recurrence rates and the increasing resistance of uropathogens to antibacterial drugs, phytotherapy has become an important treatment option in modern urology. Phytotherapeutic medications are characterized by a wide spectrum of pharmacological action, efficacy, and low toxicity, thus allowing for a long term use for treating and preventing many chronic diseases without the risk of adverse effects. Medicinal plants that make up Phytolysin nefroCAPS contain substances that have a wide direct or indirect antimicrobial effect. Plant components of Phytolysin nefroCAPS also have anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. The combination of antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effect is especially beneficial for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. In patients with chronic recurrent cystitis, co-administration of the plant based medication Phytolysin nefroCAPS and an antibacterial drug is more effective than antibacterial therapy alone. Using Phytolysin nefroCAPS, as a part of the comprehensive management of urinary tract infections, can increase the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy, while reducing the treatment duration and the incidence of adverse effects."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Urology, V.M.
