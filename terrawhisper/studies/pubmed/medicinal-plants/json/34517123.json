To improve the quality and yield of flowers, it is very important to carry out cross-breeding between different petal types of jasmine. However, because of the difficulty of sexual reproduction, there is no report on the success of jasmine crosses. In this paper, single- and double-petal jasmine plants were crossed artificially. The stigmas of single-petal plants post pollination, including those at 0\u00a0h after pollination (CK), 1\u00a0h after pollination (T1) and 6\u00a0h after pollination (T2), were sequenced by transcriptomic combined with proteomic analyses. A total of 178,098 gene products were assembled. Simultaneously, a total of 2337 protein species were identified. Some regulatory gene products and functional protein species were identified that may be involved in the process of pollen-pistil interactions. These findings suggest that the identified differentially expressed gene products and differentially accumulated protein species may play vital roles in jasmine plants in response to pollen-pistil interactions, providing important genetic resources for further functional dissection of the molecular mechanisms of these interactions. SIGNIFICANCE: These results have important scientific significance to take effective measures to overcome pre-fertilization barriers and to guide the cross breeding of jasmine. Further, they can also be used for reference in other plant breeding with the same fertilization barriers."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
