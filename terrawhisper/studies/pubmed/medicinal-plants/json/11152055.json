In vitro adipose tissue lipolysis and incorporation of glucose-U-14C into skeletal muscle glycogen was also studied.", "A single dose of CIHP II-enhanced resistance to hypothermia (rectal temperature [T(rec)] 23 degrees C) during C-H-R exposure as evidenced by increased glucose turnover rate in heart and skeletal muscle tissue. The blood glucose and skeletal muscle glycogen were conserved. Cardiac free fatty acid oxidation was also increased. During recovery from hypothermia (T(rec) 37 degrees C) blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels were conserved. Five doses of CIHP II increased resistance to cold by increased adipose fat mobilization and cardiac oxidation. Glucose oxidation was spared. During recovery from hypothermia, the glucose turnover and oxidation in skeletal muscle was increased as was fat mobilization from adipose tissue and its oxidation by heart muscle.", "CIHP II intake prior to C-H-R exposure resulted in increased glucose turnover rate and fat utilization. This perhaps helped increase the resistance to C-H-R-induced hypothermia and speeded recovery."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences, Timarpur, Delhi, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kumar", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Shyam", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Divekar", "ForeName": "H M", "Initials": "HM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pahwa", "ForeName": "M L", "Initials": "ML"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Srivastava", "ForeName": "K K", "Initials": "KK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Altern Complement Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9508124", "ISSNLinking": "1075-5535"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9005-79-2", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycogen"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glycogen"}, {"QualifierName": ["etiology", "immunology", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Hypothermia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Immune Tolerance"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Muscle, Skeletal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["complications"], "DescriptorName": "Stress, Physiological"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "3", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "11", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11152055", "10.1089/acm.2000.6.509"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
