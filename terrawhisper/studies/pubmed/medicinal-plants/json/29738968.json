The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods and the known compounds were identified by comparing with the data reported in literature. Among them, trigoheterophines A (1) and B (2) represent an unusual type of \u03b3-lactone derivatives, possessing 21 carbon atoms on the carbon skeleton, and known compouds (3-6) are rare furan derivatives in the plant kingdom with diverse long-chain hydrocarbyl groups as substituents at C-4. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activities against five human cancer cell lines: HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7 and SW480 in vitro. Compounds 1-6 showed significant antiproliferative effects against various human cancer cell lines with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.28 to 12.06\u202f\u03bcM. These findings suggest that the discoveries of these novel \u03b3-lactone derivatives and furan derivatives with significant antiproliferative activities isolated from T. heterophyllus could be of great importance to the development of new anticancer agents."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
