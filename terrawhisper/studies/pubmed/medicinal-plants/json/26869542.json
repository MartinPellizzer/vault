The area was visited 17 times, and semi-structured and open-ended interviews were conducted in both the plain area nearby the Swat River (4 villages) and mountains (7 villages). A total of 83 erudite informants participated in the interviews with their prior consent. The collected data were analysed through quantitative indices viz., medicinal use value (MUV), relative frequency citation (RFC), family use value (FUV), informant consensus factor (ICF) and fidelity level (FL).", "A total of 78 species belonging to 45 vascular plant families were documented as medicinally important. Lamiaceae was observed the dominant medicinal plant family with 11 species, leaf was the most used part, and powder the most preferred preparation type. Maximum MUV (1) was shared by 15 species while maximum RFC (0.385) was demonstrated by both Brassica juncea and Lepidium sativum. Smaller families with mostly 1 species showed higher FUV while among the larger families Amaryllidaceae and Papaveraceae showed maximum FUV of 0.89 and 0.87, respectively. Highest FL was shown by Mentha arvensis (70%) against gastrointestinal diseases. Highest ICF was demonstrated by hepatic disorders (0.93). Furthermore, we revealed 108 indigenous herbal medicinal recipes, 6 plants added to the medicinal plant trade list, 1 species (Vincetoxicum arnottianum) reported for the first time as medicinal plant, and several new uses for 49 well known medicinal plants.", "The present survey documents diverse plant species that are utilised by local communities for treating a broad spectrum of disorders. Quantitative indices helped in marking important and most preferred plants. To conclude, we recommend the plants for pharmacological studies, documenting new uses, especially Vincetoxicum arnottianum, never screened before."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
