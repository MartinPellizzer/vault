Various \u03b1-chloroacetophenones, heterocyclic thienyl and furanyl substrates, and even bromoketones were completely converted to the desired chiral halohydrins by this protocol. Both (<i>R</i>)- and (<i>S</i>)-chiral halohydrins can be prepared by changing the configurations of the chiral ligand NNP with up to 99.6% ee (enantiomeric excess) and 98.8% ee, respectively.
