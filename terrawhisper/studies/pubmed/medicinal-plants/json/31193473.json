The current study was aimed at investigating the wound healing capacity of <i>Aristolochia saccata</i> leaf extract by using scratch assay as a primary model, where proliferative and migratory capabilities of test compounds could be monitored through microscopy studies. <i>A.\u00a0saccata</i> is an evergreen climbing shrub belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae.", "Methanolic extraction of the plant material was done using Soxhlet apparatus and the cytotoxicity of the extract on L929 cells was studied by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. L929 is a human fibroblast cell line. <i>In vitro</i> scratch assay was performed to evaluate the wound healing properties of <i>A.\u00a0saccata</i> leaf extract and possible mechanism of action was analyzed by flow cytometric expression studies of an extracellular matrix (ECM) factor, collagen type-1.", "MTT assay revealed that <i>A.\u00a0saccata</i> leaf extract had no cytotoxic effect on the cells and at higher concentrations, the extract showed mild toxicity resulting in the death of just 2.88% cells. Scratch assay showed 34.05%, 70.00%, 93.52% wound closure at 12hrs, 24hrs and 48hrs of incubation respectively. These results were similar compared to positive control which showed 37.60, 56.41 and 99.05% of wound closure. Further, flow cytometry-based studies revealed that the <i>A.\u00a0saccata</i> leaf extract induced the expression of ECM remodelling factor collagen-1.", "Our study revealed the wound healing capabilities of <i>A.\u00a0saccata In vitro</i>. Hence, <i>A.\u00a0saccata</i> could be recommended as a potential source of wound healing agents."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, P.O.
