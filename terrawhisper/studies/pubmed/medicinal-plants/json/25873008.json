Alternatives of antibiotics have focused on phytogenic plants, such as herbs and medicinal plants. No studies have evaluated the use of fermented medicinal plants (FMP) made up of Gynura procumbens, Rehmannia glutinosa and Scutellaria baicalensis in weanling pigs. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to determine the effects of FMP on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, fecal noxious gas emissions and diarrhea score in weanling pigs.", "FMP supplementation increased (P < 0.05) average daily gain, average daily feed intake, gain:feed, apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, nitrogen and gross energy compared with NC treatment, while a linear effect (P < 0.05) was observed on those criteria. Ammonia, total mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide concentrations were decreased (P < 0.05) by the supplementation of FMP compared with NC. Additionally, diarrhea score was lower (P < 0.05) by FMP addition compared with NC during days 0-7 and days 8-14.", "These results suggested that FMP could be used as an alternative to antibiotics by enhancing growth performance and nutrient digestibility, and decreasing fecal noxious gas emission and early diarrhea score of weanling pigs."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2015 Society of Chemical Industry."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Resource and Science, Dankook University, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Zhao", "ForeName": "Pinyao", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Resource and Science, Dankook University, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hanlin", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Resource and Science, Dankook University, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Lei", "ForeName": "Yan", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Resource and Science, Dankook University, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Tianshui", "Initials": "T"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Sunbio Ltd, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Sunki", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Animal Resource and Science, Dankook University, Cheonan, Chungnam, 330-714, South Korea."}], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Inho", "Initials": "I"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Sci Food Agric", "NlmUniqueID": "0376334", "ISSNLinking": "0022-5142"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "tusanqi"}, {"RegistryNumber": "YY9FVM7NSN", "NameOfSubstance": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Diarrhea"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digestion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Feces"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen Sulfide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rehmannia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Scutellaria baicalensis"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Sulfhydryl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Sus scrofa"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Swine"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Swine Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2014", "Month": "10", "Day": "5"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "3"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2015", "Month": "4", "Day": "16", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "11", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["25873008", "10.1002/jsfa.7217"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
