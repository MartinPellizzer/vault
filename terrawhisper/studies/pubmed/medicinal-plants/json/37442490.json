Although it has been used for centuries, no scientific studies have proved its potential effects on inflammatory pain and central nervous system (CNS) safety profiles.", "This study aimed to evaluate the potential effects of the ethanolic extract of C. latifolia rhizome on inflammatory pain in mice, together with its CNS safety profiles.", "First, network pharmacology was employed to identify the role of bioactive constituents in C. latifolia on inflammatory pain. In addition, in vitro pharmacology was also evaluated to confirm the anti-inflammatory activity of C. latifolia extract at cellular levels in activated macrophages and microglia. Furthermore, the efficacy of the plant extract in attenuating formalin-induced pain-like behaviors in mice was evaluated. Mice were orally administered the extract (125, 250, 500\u00a0mg/kg) followed by the measurement of formalin-induced pain-like behaviors. The LABORAS automated behavioral analysis and rotarod test were used to assess potential CNS side effects of C. latifolia extract (500\u00a0mg/kg) in mice.", "The results demonstrated that major bioactive constituents present in C. latifolia have the ability to regulate multiple targets, biological processes and pathways associated with inflammatory pain as assessed by network pharmacology. C. latifolia modulated peripheral and central immune cells via reducing proinflammatory mediators (NO, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6). C. latifolia extract improved formalin-induced pain-like behaviors in a dose-dependent manner during phase II of the formalin test. The efficacy of the plant extract at doses of 250 and 500\u00a0mg/kg was comparable to that of the positive control (indomethacin 10\u00a0mg/kg). Furthermore, the highest therapeutic dose of the extract did not affect motor coordination, exploratory behaviors, general behaviors, and overall well-being of mice, indicating no development of potential CNS adverse effects after administration of the extract.", "These findings provide novel perspectives on using C. latifolia extract for pain management, considering its therapeutic efficacy and CNS safety."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023.
