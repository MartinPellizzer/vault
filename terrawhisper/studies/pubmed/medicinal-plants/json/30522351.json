This study was conducted to better understand the pattern and outcome of Datura/Brugmansia plant related poisoning in Taiwan.", "This is a retrospective case series study of all cases with Datura/Brugmansia exposure reported to the Taiwan Poison Control Center between 1986 and 2015. Data for patients with relevant poisoning were reviewed and abstracted. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of the severity of poisoning; bivariate analysis was employed to assess the effectiveness of physostigmine in the treatment of Datura/Brugmansia poisoning.", "A total of 203 cases involving 114 Datura exposures and 89 Brugmansia suaveolens exposures were eligible for analysis. Using Datura/Brugmansia for a medicinal purpose by the patients without consulting Chinese medicine practitioners was the most common reason of poisoning (81.2%); whereas only 2% of the patients were poisoned after medicinal use associated with the prescription from Chinese medicine practitioners. None of the 203 patients had used Datura/Brugmansia plant for recreational purpose. Most frequently observed clinical effect was mydriasis (53.2%), followed by confusion (40%), tachycardia (35.5%), dry mouth (35.5%), dizziness (34%), dry skin (32.5%), and delirium (31%). Seventy-three cases (36%) had severe effects; none of them died. Misidentification of the plants and ingestion of plant parts other than flowers were positively associated with the severity of poisoning. Forty patients (19.7%) received physostigmine therapy and patients receiving physostigmine had an earlier resolution of central nervous system toxicity than those who did not.", "Medicinal use without consulting Chinese medicine practitioners is the main reason for Datura/Brugmansia poisoning in Taiwan. Consumption of parts other than flowers and misidentification of the plants predicted the severity of poisoning in this study. Patients who received physostigmine appear to have earlier improvement in the central nervous system effects. No adverse events were reported from physostigmine administration."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a International Health Program, School of Medicine , National Yang-Ming University , Taipei , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Clinical Toxicology & Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine , Taipei Veterans General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Doan", "ForeName": "Uyen Vy", "Initials": "UV"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Clinical Toxicology & Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine , Taipei Veterans General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, School of Medicine , National Yang-Ming University , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Ming-Ling", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "d Department of Emergency Medicine , Tan Tock Seng Hospital , Singapore , Singapore."}], "LastName": "Phua", "ForeName": "Dong-Haur", "Initials": "DH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "e Centro de Investigaciones e Intervenciones en Salud , Leon, Nicaragua."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "f Pan American Health Organization , Tegucigalpa , Honduras."}], "LastName": "Mendez Rojas", "ForeName": "Bomar", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "b Division of Clinical Toxicology & Occupational Medicine, Department of Medicine , Taipei Veterans General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "c Institute of Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, School of Medicine , National Yang-Ming University , Taipei , Taiwan."}], "LastName": "Yang", "ForeName": "Chen-Chang", "Initials": "CC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Video-Audio Media"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Clin Toxicol (Phila)", "NlmUniqueID": "101241654", "ISSNLinking": "1556-3650"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Muscarinic Antagonists"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9U1VM840SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Physostigmine"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Brugmansia"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Cholinesterase Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": ["poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Datura"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["toxicity"], "DescriptorName": "Muscarinic Antagonists"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Physostigmine"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "epidemiology", "etiology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Poisoning"}, {"QualifierName": ["adverse effects", "poisoning"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Poison Control Centers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Retrospective Studies"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Taiwan"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "14", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "1", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30522351", "10.1080/15563650.2018.1513527"]}}]}
