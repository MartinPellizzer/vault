Toosendanin is a phytochemical found in the medicinal plant Melia toosendan Sieb. et Zucc. of the Meliaceae family. Toosendanin and its derivatives demonstrate high insecticidal activity and are important pesticides derived from plants. Despite intensive investigation of limonoids over several decades, the biosynthetic pathway of these triterpenoids is less understood. To identify the key enzymes involved in the toosendanin biosynthetic pathway, we analyzed the contents of toosendanin in various plant tissues and parts and found that the highest level of toosendanin was found in the developing fruit and gradually decreased as the fruit matured. More than 346\u2009116 transcripts were assembled based on 394 million paired-end Illumina reads and 6 million PacBio reads from the pooled RNA samples of fruits, leaves and young barks. A total of 186\u2009263 genes were predicted. Six 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) genes were identified by analyzing the association between gene expression and metabolite profiles. Functional analyses using the Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression assay showed that MtOSC1 catalyzed 2,3-oxidosqualene to produce a tetracyclic triterpene skeleton, tirucalla-7,24-dien-3\u03b2-ol, which is predicted as the precursor for toosendanin biosynthesis. We identified another OSC, MtOSC6, which is a lupeol synthase. Using synthetic biology methods, these identified enzymes could be used to model a biosynthetic pathway to produce large quantities of toosendanin."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2020 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China."}], "LastName": "Lian", "ForeName": "Xufan", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-5280-3049"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Ministry of Education, Harbin, 150040, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Plant Bioactive Substance Biosynthesis and Utilization, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xiuli", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chengdu Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu, 610041, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Fei", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Natural Product Chemistry, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiaoning", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-7203-9794"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Saline-alkali Vegetation Ecology Restoration (Northeast Forestry University), Ministry of Education, Harbin, 150040, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Heilongjiang Key Laboratory of Plant Bioactive Substance Biosynthesis and Utilization, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, 150040, China."}], "LastName": "Xue", "ForeName": "Zheyong", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7175-115X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China."}], "LastName": "Qi", "ForeName": "Xiaoquan", "Initials": "X"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "31970314", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "31770332", "Agency": "National Natural Science Foundation of China", "Country": ""}, {"Agency": "Heilongjiang Touyan Innovation Team Program (Tree Genetics and Breeding Innovation Team)", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "2017YFD0201405", "Agency": "National Key Research and Development Program of China", "Country": ""}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Physiol Plant", "NlmUniqueID": "1256322", "ISSNLinking": "0031-9317"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "79304-40-8", "NameOfSubstance": "toosendanin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Intramolecular Transferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 5.4.99.7", "NameOfSubstance": "lanosterol synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biosynthetic Pathways"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Intramolecular Transferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Melia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Akira I, Mari K, Tsutomu N (1988) Phytochemical studies on meliaceous plants.
