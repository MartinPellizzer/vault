Fubaiju Caused by <i>Stagonosporopsis chrysanthemi</i> in China.", "Abstract": {"AbstractText": ["Chrysanthemum (<i>Chrysanthemum morifolium</i> cv. Fubaiju) is used as medicinal herb (Chen et al. 2020). In October 2021, a leaf spot disease was observed on leaves of <i>C. morifolium</i> in Huanggang, Hubei province. Disease incidence was approximately 40%. Leaf lesions manifested as necrotic spots, coalesced, and expanded to form brown-black spots, leading to wilting of the leaves. On stems, the lesions manifested as dark brown necrotic spots. To identify the pathogen, 29 pieces (5 \u00d7 5 mm) from lesion margins were surface sterilized in 1% NaOCl and rinsed three times with sterile water. The pieces were transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) for incubation at 25\u2103 for 3 d in the dark. Fifteen fungal colonies were successfully isolated. The colony morphology with flat wavy edge, sparse aerial mycelia, and surface olivaceous black were observed at 7 days post incubation. Subglobular pycnidia were brown with a short beak, and pycnidia diameters were thick (212 to 265 \u00d7 189 to 363 \u00b5m, n = 20). Ovoid conidia were aseptate and hyaline, conidia diameters were thick (4.0 to 9.8 \u00d7 1.8 to 4.7 \u00b5m, n = 100). The morphological characters of these isolates were consistent with those of <i>Stagonosporopsis chrysanthemi</i> (Zhao et al. 2021). Pure culture of representative HGNU2021-18 isolated from the diseased leaves subjected to molecular identification. Sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, 28S large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU), \u03b2-tubulin (<i>TUB2</i>), actin (<i>ACT</i>), and partial RNA polymerase II largest subunit (<i>RPB2</i>) genes were amplified from genomic DNA of isolate HGNU2021-18 using the following primer pairs: ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), LR0R/LR5 (Rehner et al. 1994), Btub2Fd/Btub4Rd (Woudenberg et al. 2009), ACT512F/ACT783R (Carbone et al.1999), and RPB2-5F2 (Sung et al. 2007)/fRPB2-7cR (Liu et al. 1999), respectively. The PCR products were purified and then sequenced by Sangon Biotech (China). Nucleotide sequences of ITS (544 bp, OM346748), LSU (905 bp, OM758418), <i>TUB2</i> (563 bp, OM945724), <i>ACT</i> (294 bp, OM793715), and <i>RPB</i>2 (957 bp, OM793716) amplified from the isolate HGNU2021-18 were subjected to BLASTn analysis. The results showed that ITS, LSU, <i>TUB2</i>, <i>ACT</i>, and <i>RPB2</i> shared 100.00%, 99.45%, 99.20%, 100.00%, and 100.00% sequence identity to the five published sequences (MW810272.1, MH869953.1, MW815129.1, JN251973.1, and MT018012.1, respectively) of the <i>S. chrysanthemi</i> isolate CBS 500.63. Phylogenetic analysis of the multilocus sequences of ITS, LSU, <i>RPB2</i>, <i>ACT</i>, and <i>TUB2</i> belonging to different <i>Stagonosporopsis</i> species was performed in MEGA 7.0 (Chen et al. 2015). Isolate HGNU2021-18 was placed in a clade with <i>S. chrysanthemi</i> with 99% bootstrap support. Thus, the results of morphological and molecular analyses indicated that the disease symptoms on chrysanthemum plants were caused by <i>S. chrysanthemi</i>. Under conditions of 25\u00b0C and 85% relative humidity, pathogenicity test was performed on 2-month-old healthy plants using isolate HGNU2021-18. The leaves were inoculated with 5 mm diameter mycelial plugs or with sterile agar plugs (control). Six plants were used in each treatment. Disease symptoms were observed on treated plants at 2 weeks post inoculation which were those previously observed in the field, while the control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was re-isolated from the diseased plants, and <i>S. chrysanthemi</i> was confirmed as the causal pathogen. This is the first report of <i>S. chrysanthemi</i> causing stem and foliage blight of chrysanthemum in China."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huanggang Normal University, 117800, College of Biology and Agricultural Resources, Huanggang\uff0cHubei\uff0cChina, Huanggang, China, 438000."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Economic Forest Germplasm Improvement and Comprehensive Utilization of Resources, 554680, Huanggang, China, 438000; ruilinglv@126.com."}], "LastName": "Lyu", "ForeName": "Ruiling", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Shanxi Agricultural University, 74600, Taigu, Shanxi , China; jichunjia@outlook.com."}], "LastName": "Jia", "ForeName": "Jichun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huazhong Agricultural University, 47895, State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Hubei Key Laboratory of Plant Pathology, , Wuhan, Hubei , China; h.h@webmail.hzau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Huang", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huanggang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Huanggang, China; daibaosheng@126.com."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Baosheng", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huanggang Normal University, 117800, College of Biology and Agricultural Resources, Huanggang, China; wq18303583299@163.com."}], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "Qi", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Huazhong Agricultural University, 47895, State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Hubei Key Laboratory of Plant Pathology, , Wuhan, Hubei , China; jiataoxie@mail.hzau.edu.cn."}], "LastName": "Xie", "ForeName": "Jiatao", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Plant Dis", "NlmUniqueID": "9882809", "ISSNLinking": "0191-2917"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "18", "Minute": "44"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "3", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "33"}], "PublicationStatus": "aheadofprint", "ArticleIdList": ["38568791", "10.1094/PDIS-01-24-0234-PDN"]}}]}
