One systematic review showed that topical diclofenac and topical ketoprofen can alleviate pain. However, another systematic review found that topical diclofenac and ketoprofen had limited efficacy in knee OA at 6 to 12\u00a0weeks. Many studies with a low level of evidence have reported some pain mitigation using the rest of aforementioned topical therapies.", "Although some controversy exists on the role of topical NSAIDs, current management guidelines advise topical NSAIDs as an option and even first-line therapy for knee OA treatment, particularly among elderly patients. Topical NSAIDs may be contemplated as similar options to oral NSAIDs and are associated with fewer gastrointestinal complications when compared with oral NSAIDs. Caution should be taken with the use of both topical and oral NSAIDs, including close adherence to dosing regimens and monitoring, especially for patients with previous complications of NSAIDs. The role of other topical therapies needs further research."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "a Department of Orthopaedic Surgery , La Paz University Hospital-IdiPaz , Madrid , Spain."}], "LastName": "Rodriguez-Merchan", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Postgrad Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0401147", "ISSNLinking": "0032-5481"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sensory System Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "15OX67P384", "NameOfSubstance": "zucapsaicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Administration, Cutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Nonprescription Drugs"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Osteoarthritis, Knee"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Sensory System Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "10", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "8", "Day": "30", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30156934", "10.1080/00325481.2018.1505182"]}}]}
