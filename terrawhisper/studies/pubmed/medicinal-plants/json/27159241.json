Acute toxicity of the extract (2000\u2009mg/kg) was examined in Swiss albino mice for 14 days, before croton oil-induced ear oedema in mice, carrageenan-induced paw oedema in Swiss albino rats, cotton pellet-induced granuloma in rats and carrageenan-induced air pouch in mice were conducted. The IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 release from concanavalin A-stimulated monocytes was measured by ELISA.", "Methanol extract of H. cheirifolia is rich in polyphenols and flavonoids. Cinnamic acid and rutin represent the major constituents. Methanol extract up to 2000\u2009mg/kg did not produce any toxic effects. Topical application of 2\u2009mg/ear of the extract produced 78.7% of inhibition on ear swilling. Oral pre-treatment of rats with 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg of the extract inhibited paw oedema by 70% and 89%, respectively. At 200\u2009mg/kg, granuloma dry and wet weights were reduced by 41.85% and 61.72%, respectively. Moreover, the treatment with methanol extract at 1\u2009mg/kg exerted 62.7% of inhibition on leucocytes migrated into the ear pouch.
