It shows significant pharmacological activities in the treatment of dysentery, eczema, fever, jaundice, vulvar swelling, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and inflammatory disorders. Alkaloids and flavonoids have been identified as virtual components, especially isoprenoid flavanonols are a class of characteristic compounds for S. flavescens. However, few studies have focused on isoprenoid flavonoids analyses and no comprehensive review has yet been published. In the current review, we systematically summarized the isoprenoid flavonoids, a total of 55 compounds have been isolated from S. flavescens, particularly an isoprenyl and a lavandulyl group in backbone structures. Further pharmacological activities, qualitative and quantitative chemical analyses research will contribute to the development of natural isoprenoid flavonoid products in S. flavescens."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
