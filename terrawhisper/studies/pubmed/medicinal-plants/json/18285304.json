Many plants have been known to possess antifertility activity, but limited attempts have been made to scientifically evaluate these claims. Hence the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifertility and reproductive toxicity potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (Loranthaceae) in male Wistar rats. An oral 70% methanolic extract of stem of D. falcata at a dose level of 100 mg/kg wt/day fed to male albino rats for 60 days did not decrease body weight, while the testes and epididymides were significantly reduced, and the seminal vesicles and ventral prostate also showed a significant reduction (P < 0.01). Treated animals showed a notable depression of spermatogenesis. As a result of 100 mg/kg extract feeding, the preleptotene spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes, step-19 spermatids and the mature Leydig cells decreased by 74.36%, 80.03%, 79.87%, 32.37%, respectively. At this dose Leydig cell nuclear area and cytoplasmic area, as well as the cross sectional surface area of Sertoli cells, were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) when compared to controls. The reduced sperm count and motility resulted in 100% negative fertility at 100 mg/kg dose level. A significant fall in the total protein and sialic acid content in the testes, epididymides, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate, as well as in the glycogen content of testes was also observed. The level of serum protein, cholesterol, billirubin, SGOT, SGPT, blood urea, and hematological indices were unaltered. In conclusion, Dendrophthoe falcata brought about the inhibition of spermatogenesis."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Reproduction Physiology Section, Department of Zoology, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur-302 004, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gupta", "ForeName": "R S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kachhawa", "ForeName": "J B S", "Initials": "JB"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sharma", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Herb Pharmacother", "NlmUniqueID": "100888586", "ISSNLinking": "1522-8940"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antispermatogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antispermatogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Contraceptive Agents, Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Fertility"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Loranthaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Stems"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Spermatogenesis"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "3", "Day": "14", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "2", "Day": "21", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18285304", "10.1300/j157v07n02_01"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
