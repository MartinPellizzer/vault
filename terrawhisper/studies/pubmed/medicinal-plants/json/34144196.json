Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective antiepileptic drugs, and medicinal plants provide an attractive source for new compounds. Pergularia daemia (Asclepiadaceae) is used in Cameroon traditional medicine to treat stroke, anemia, inflammation, and epilepsy. Recently, traditional healers claim that an hydro-ethanolic extract of the roots of P. daemia is more effective than an aqueous extract on refractory seizures.", "The antiepileptic effect of P. daemia hydro-ethanolic extract was investigated on the pentylenetetrazole kindling model of temporal lobe epilepsy in mice and possible mechanisms of action.", "Mice were divided into 8 groups treated as follows: normal group received distilled water (10\u00a0ml/kg, p.o.), control group received distilled water (10\u00a0ml/kg, p.o.), ethanol group received ethanol (5%, p.o.), positive control received sodium valproate (300\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.), and test groups received P. daemia hydro-ethanolic (HE) extract (1.6, 4, 8 and 16\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.). All groups were kindled by 11 injections of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (35\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), once every alternate day (48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0h), until the development of kindling, i.e., the occurrence of stage 5 seizures for two consecutive trials. One week later, i.e., 29<sup>th</sup> day, mice were challenged with a single and lower dose of PTZ (25 mg/kg, i.p.) that does not induce seizures in normal mice but causes seizures in mice prone to seizures and behavioral alterations. After completion of the kindling procedure, Morris water maze, passive avoidance, and open field tests were performed. Afterward, animals were euthanized, and hippocampi were removed for the estimation of the levels of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), L-glutamate decarboxylase (L-GAD), and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation markers also were quantified. Finally, histological analysis of the hippocampus was carried out.", "PTZ-kindling induced myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures in control mice. However, the HE extract of P. daemia (4-16\u00a0mg/kg), compared to sodium valproate, significantly protected mice against myoclonic jerks and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Also, the HE extract (1.6-16\u00a0mg/kg) significantly increased the seizure score. Furthermore, the HE extract of P. daemia significantly reduced seizure-induced cognitive impairments. PTZ-kindling induced significant alterations in GABA, GABA-T, and L-GAD contents as well as oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, and the HE extract significantly reversed these effects, suggesting possible mechanisms. All these activities of the HE extract were confirmed by its protective effect against neuronal loss in the hippocampus.", "The HE extract of P. daemia protected mice against kindled seizures and cognitive impairments, and these effects were greater than those of sodium valproate, a widely used antiepileptic drug. These effects may be mediated by neuromodulatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, thus suggesting a neuroprotective effect. These findings help to explain the beneficial use of these HE extracts of P.daemia in traditional medicine to treat epilepsy in Cameroon."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier B.V.
