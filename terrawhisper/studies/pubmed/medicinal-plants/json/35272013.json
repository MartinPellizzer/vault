Tea saponin is an important functional component of C. vietnamensis, and squalene is the precursor substance that controls its formation. Squalene synthase (SQS: EC 2.5.1.21) synthesizes squalene from 2 molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). In this study, 1683 bp of the C. vietnamensis SQS gene, designated as CvSQS, was cloned and encoded 414 amino acids. Bioinformatics and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed the high homology of CvSQS with squalene synthases from other plants. For soluble proteins, the carboxy-terminal deleted CvSQS was obtained for expression in Escherichia coli Transetta (DE3), and the recombinant protein with a weight of 42.5\u00a0kDa was detected using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. After an enzymatic reaction, the presence of squalene in the product was analyzed using GC-MS detection, which indicated that CvSQS had catalytic activity. The tissue specificity of CvSQS and its presence in seeds at various ripening stages was detected by q-RT PCR. CvSQS had the highest transcriptional level in leaves, followed by seeds, roots, and flowers; the amount of CvSQS in the seeds was highest in September. The identification and functional characterization of CvSQS is essential for further studies on the regulation mechanism of tea saponin in C. vietnamensis."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Inc.
