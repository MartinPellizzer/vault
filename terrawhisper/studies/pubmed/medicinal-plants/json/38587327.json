Decynium\u201122 (D22) inhibits an alternative neurotransmitter removal pathway, namely uptake\u20112. Uptake\u20112 includes plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT) and organic cation transporters that have a low affinity, but high capacity for uptake of various monoamines such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. This study was done to assess the effect of uptake\u20112 inhibition on morphine\u2011induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and analgesia. In this study, the effects of morphine and/or D22 on CPP were evaluated following intraperitoneal injection in mice. Afterward, changes in motor activity were evaluated by the open field test. Using the tail\u2011flick model, the effects of D22 and/or morphine were evaluated on the pain threshold. The results showed that 20 mg/kg of morphine induced a place preference response. D22, at the dose of 0.03 mg/kg, caused place avoidance, while at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg, it produced a notable place preference response. Co\u2011administration of D22 and morphine showed that morphine reversed the CPP aversion induced by D22 at the lowest dose. Motor activity did not alter. In the tail\u2011flick test, morphine, at the dose of 3 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kg, increased the pain threshold. D22 induced significant analgesic responses. Co\u2011administration of D22 and morphine caused considerable analgesic effects. The findings revealed that D22 induced both conditioned aversion and preference depending on the dose while morphine induced CPP. Both drugs produced analgesia."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Souri", "ForeName": "Mohammad Saeid", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmacological Research Center of Medicinal Plants, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Alavi", "ForeName": "Mohaddeseh Sadat", "Initials": "MS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacodynamics and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Salami", "ForeName": "Ali Ahmadian", "Initials": "AA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Pharmaceutical Research Center, Pharmaceutical Technology Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Roohbakhsh", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Poland", "MedlineTA": "Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars)", "NlmUniqueID": "1246675", "ISSNLinking": "0065-1400"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "76I7G6D29C", "NameOfSubstance": "Morphine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "VTD58H1Z2X", "NameOfSubstance": "Dopamine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "333DO1RDJY", "NameOfSubstance": "Serotonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Analgesics"}, {"RegistryNumber": "X4W3ENH1CV", "NameOfSubstance": "Norepinephrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Morphine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dopamine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Serotonin"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Pain"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Analgesics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Norepinephrine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neurotransmitter Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "9", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "45"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2024", "Month": "4", "Day": "8", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "26"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["38587327", "10.55782/ane-2024-2517"]}}]}
