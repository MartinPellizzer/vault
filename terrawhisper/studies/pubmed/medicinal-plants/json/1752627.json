The inhibitor had an absorption maximum at 200 nm, was not precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, was dialysable and resistant to inactivation by heating at 98 degrees C for 4 hr, protease and ribonuclease digestion; but was acid labile. The chromatographically pure preparation inhibited both mung bean and sheep liver SHMT. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that it contained a carbohydrate moiety, an O-amino and vicinal diol groups. Paper electrophoresis at pH 4.3 suggested that the inhibitor was positively charged."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore."}], "LastName": "Vijaya", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Sukanya", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Savithri", "ForeName": "H S", "Initials": "HS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "N A", "Initials": "NA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0310774", "ISSNLinking": "0301-1208"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.2.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Inhibitors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Glycine Hydroxymethyltransferase"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Sheep"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "8", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1752627"]}}]}
