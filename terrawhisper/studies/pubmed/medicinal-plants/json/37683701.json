In this paper, the traditional Chinese medicinal plants containing RIPs protein were sorted out, and their pharmacological effects and clinical applications were analyzed. Since many RIPs in traditional Chinese medicine plants exhibit antiviral and antitumor activities and show great clinical application potential, people's interest in these proteins is on the rise. This paper summarizes the possible mechanism of RIPs's anti-virus and anti-tumor effects, and discusses its potential problems and risks, laying a foundation for subsequent research on how to exert its anti-virus and anti-tumor effects."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier Ltd.
