In addition to several promising pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects, a large number of triterpenoids have revealed high potential for cancer therapy through their strong cytotoxicity on cancer cell lines and, also, low toxicity in normal cells. So, this study was aimed at discovering novel and potentially bioactive triterpenoids from the <i>Salvia urmiensis</i> species. For this, an ethyl acetate fraction of the acetone extract of the aerial parts of the plant was chromatographed to yield five novel polyhydroxylated triterpenoids (1: -5: ). Their structure was elucidated by extensive spectroscopic methods including 1D (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, DEPT-Q) and 2D\u2009NMR (COSY, HSQC, HMBC, NOESY) experiments, as well as HRESIMS analysis. Cytotoxic activity of the purified compounds was also investigated by MTT assay against the MCF-7 cancer cell line. Furthermore, a molecular docking analysis was applied to evaluate the inhibition potential of the ligands against the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-<i>\u03ba</i>B) protein, which promotes tumor metastasis or affects gene expression in cancer disease. The 1<i>\u03b2</i>,11<i>\u03b2</i>,22<i>\u03b1</i>-trihydroxy-olean-12-ene-3-one (compound 4: ) indicated the best activity in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in silico</i> assays, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 32\u2009\u00b5M and a docking score value of -\u20093.976\u2009kcal/mol, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Thieme.
