Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting.", "Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230\u2009m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture.", "This study helps to better understand the ecosystem functions by investigating of endophytic fungi distribution under different ecological conditions.
