The true underlying pathology of PD yet remains a mystery, however, recent advances in the field have pointed towards the production of \u03b1-synuclein aggregates, oxidative stress, and an imbalance between levels of acetylcholine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain that have been shown to result in loss of coordinated movement. Current treatments of PD include the gold standard dopamine precursor L-dopa, dopamine agonists pergolide and bromocriptine, catechol-o-methyl transferases inhibitors, entacapone and tolcapone and monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as Selegine and Rasagiline amongst several other drugs. While these drugs are successful in treating motor symptoms of the disease, they do so with a plethora of side effects that are especially debilitating to the elderly. In the recent years, a considerable amount of attention has been shifted towards phytocompounds such as flavonoids and green tea catechins due to promising experimental results. In this review, we have compiled phytocompounds that have shown potent activity against some of the most important targets for antiparkinsonian therapy. These compounds have exhibited activities that transcend the limits of simply attenuating mitochondrial oxidative stress and have opened doors to the discovery of novel lead compounds for newer, efficacious antiparkinsonian therapies with wider therapeutic windows."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
