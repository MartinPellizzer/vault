We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze demographic and practice factors associated with herb use.", "Of the 1249 health care professionals surveyed, 51% reported using an herb in the last week. The rates of use were highest among physician assistants or nurse practitioners (PA or NP) (63%), clinical nurses (59%), and HCP students (52%), while physicians (48%), dietitians (40%), and pharmacists (37%) had lower rates. Among health care professionals who reported herb use, the most common herbs taken were green tea (24%), flax seed (18%), chamomile (11%), and aloe vera (8%). Factors associated with herb use included older age, being a nurse, a HCP student, an NP or PA compared with being a physician, being non-Caucasian, living outside of North Carolina and having increased knowledge of herbs and dietary supplements."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division for Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. paula_gardiner@hms.harvard.edu"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gardiner", "ForeName": "Paula", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Legedza", "ForeName": "Anna", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Woods", "ForeName": "Charles", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phillips", "ForeName": "Russell S", "Initials": "RS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kemper", "ForeName": "Kathi J", "Initials": "KJ"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "K24-AT000589", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "R01 LM007709", "Acronym": "LM", "Agency": "NLM NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}, {"GrantID": "T32-AT0051-03", "Acronym": "AT", "Agency": "NCCIH NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Herb Pharmacother", "NlmUniqueID": "100888586", "ISSNLinking": "1522-8940"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Curriculum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Supplements"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Education, Medical, Continuing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["statistics & numerical data"], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Internet"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "North Carolina"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17182485"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
