In addition, the protective effects against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage in a mammalian cell line were examined. The ethanol extracts of the peony root (PREs) and its active constituents, gallic acid and methyl gallate, exhibited a significant free radical scavenging effect against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine (DPPH) radical generation and had an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation, as measured by the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) formation. The PREs did not have any pro-oxidant effect. They strongly inhibited the hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage from NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, as assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the oral administration of 50% PRE (50% ethanol extract of peony root), gallic acid and methyl gallate potently inhibited the formation of micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRET) in the mouse peripheral blood induced by a KBrO3 treatment in vivo. Therefore, PREs containing gallic acid and methyl gallate may be a useful antigenotoxic antioxidant by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and protecting against oxidative DNA damage without exhibiting any pro-oxidant effect."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Pharmacy, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon 200-701, Korea"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lee", "ForeName": "Seung Chul", "Initials": "SC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kwon", "ForeName": "Yong Soo", "Initials": "YS"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Son", "ForeName": "Kyung Hun", "Initials": "KH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "Hyun Pyo", "Initials": "HP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Heo", "ForeName": "Moon Young", "Initials": "MY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Korea (South)", "MedlineTA": "Arch Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8000036", "ISSNLinking": "0253-6269"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "623D3XG80C", "NameOfSubstance": "methyl gallate"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "DNA Damage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice, Inbred ICR"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "NIH 3T3 Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Oxidative Stress"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Paeonia"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "6", "Day": "10", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16114491", "10.1007/BF02977342"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
