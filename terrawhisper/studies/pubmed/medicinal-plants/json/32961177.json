The films were also analysed by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and rheometer etc., meanwhile, the antimicrobial activities and acute toxicity of the films were investigated. The addition of Ag nanoparticles and DOM decreased the tensile strength, water solubility and transparency value, while increased the elongation at break. The functional groups and thermal analysis of films presented no significant differences, and the film-forming solutions showed similar shear-thinning properties. Antimicrobial evaluation revealed that the films achieved significant antibaterial effects against both Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria. The biodegradable films presented a compact and uniform structure with antibacterial properties and without toxicological responses, which has excellent potential to be applied in food packaging."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
