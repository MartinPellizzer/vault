Indigenous women from the highland community of Cajola formed the Asociacion Pro-Bienestar de la Mujer Mam (APBMM). The APBMM identified a need for women health promoters and good, low-cost medicines. The Instituto de Educacion Integral para la Salud y el Desarrollo (IDEI) helped train 16 women as health communicators or promoters in 1996. The health communicators learned about setting up community medicine distribution. The mayor bypassed APBMM's efforts to set up medicine distribution and set up a community pharmacy himself. Someone else opened a private pharmacy. The 200-member group was frustrated and redirected their energies to making natural herbal medicines, such as eucalyptus rub. The group set up a community medicine chest in the IDEI medical clinic and sold modern medicine, homemade vapor rubs, and syrups. The group was joined by midwives and other volunteers and began educating mothers about treatment of diarrhea and respiratory diseases. The Drogueria Estatal, which distributes medicines nationally to nongovernmental groups, agreed to sell high quality, low cost medicine to the medicine chest, which was renamed Venta Social de Medicamentos (VSM). The health communicators are working on three potential income generation projects: VSM, the production and sale of traditional medicines and educational materials, and an experimental greenhouse to grow medicinal plants and research other crops that can be grown in the highlands."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "KeywordList": [["Americas", "Central America", "Community Workers", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Demographic Factors", "Developing Countries", "Distributional Activities", "Economic Development", "Economic Factors", "Guatemala", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Income Generation Programs", "Indigenous Population", "Interest Groups", "Latin America", "Nonclinical Distribution", "North America", "Organization And Administration", "Pharmacy Distribution", "Political Factors", "Population", "Population Characteristics", "Program Activities", "Programs", "Summary Report", "Sustainable Development", "Women's Groups"]], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: HESPERIAN FOUNDATION NEWS"], "PMID": "12348709", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1999", "Month": "01", "Day": "06"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2021", "Month": "12", "Day": "03"}, "Article": {"ArticleDate": [], "Language": ["eng"], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"PubDate": {"Year": "1998", "Season": "Summer"}}, "Title": "Hesperian Foundation news", "ISOAbbreviation": "Hesperian Found News"}, "ArticleTitle": "Funding women's health work -- no easy answers.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "MedlinePgn": "6"}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ikeda", "ForeName": "J", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Hesperian Found News", "NlmUniqueID": "101085191"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Americas"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Central America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Health Workers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Conservation of Natural Resources"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Demography"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Economics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ethnicity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Guatemala"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Planning"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Income"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Latin America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "North America"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Organization and Administration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Politics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Population Characteristics"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Public Opinion"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Research"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Women"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "9", "Day": "28", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12348709"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
