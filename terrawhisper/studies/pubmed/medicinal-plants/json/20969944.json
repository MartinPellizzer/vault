Thus, the aim of the study is to explore whether anti-inflammatory action of MEC is related with HO-1 induction in RAW 264.7 cells.", "The present study was designed to investigate as to MEC induces HO-1 expression so that it reduces inflammation by suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in cells activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).", "Expression of HO-1 protein by MEC in macrophages was increased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with MEC significantly inhibited upregulation of both iNOS and COX-2 in LPS-activated macrophages and consequently reduced production of NO and PGE(2), respectively. The reduced expression of iNOS and COX-2 by MEC was reversed by siHO-1 RNA transfection. In addition, NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) was translocated from cytosol to nucleus by MEC. The binding of NF-\u03baB as well as NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was also significantly diminished by MEC. Finally, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-mediated VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cell was significantly inhibited by MEC.", "The present results show that MEC induces HO-1 expression via Nrf2 translocation and inhibits NF-\u03baB activity, which may be responsible for anti-inflammatory action. Therefore, we propose that anti-inflammatory action of MEC involves at least HO-1 induction."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
