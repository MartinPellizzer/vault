Many studies have demonstrated the antiplaque, antiperiopathic, anticaries and antibacterial effect of these sticks. This study was designed to investigate the antimycotic effect, if any, of the aqueous extract of the plant roots. Various concentrations of aqueous extract of miswak prepared with Sabouraud medium were inoculated with Candida albicans (oral isolate). These were incubated at 37 degrees C and the turbidity was determined by OD at 600 nm wavelength measured at specific intervals over a period of 48 h. Data show that the extract at a concentration of 15% and above, has a fungistatic effect for up to 48 h. This antimycotic effect was probably due to one or more of the root contents which included chlorine, trimethylamine, and alkaloid resin, and sulphur compounds."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."}], "LastName": "al-Bagieh", "ForeName": "N H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Idowu", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salako", "ForeName": "N O", "Initials": "NO"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Microbios", "NlmUniqueID": "0207257", "ISSNLinking": "0026-2633"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Candida albicans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Roots"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1994", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["7898373"]}}]}
