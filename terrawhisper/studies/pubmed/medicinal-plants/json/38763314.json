However, only five naturally occurring farnesylated chalcones were described in the literature until now. Here, the farnesylation of six chalcones by the Aspergillus terreus aromatic prenyltransferase AtaPT was reported. Fourteen monofarnesylated chalcones (1F1-1F5, 2F1-2F3, 3F1, 3F2, 4F1, 4F2, 5F1, 6F1, and 6F2) and a difarnesylated product (2F3) were obtained, enriching the diversity of natural farnesylated chalcones significantly. Ten of them are C-farnesylated products, which complement O-farnesylated chalcones by chemical synthesis. Fourteen products have not been reported prior to this study. Nine of the produced compounds (1F2-1F5, 2F1-2F3, 5F1, and 6F1) exhibited inhibitory effect on \u03b1-glucosidase with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 24.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.44 to 190.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28\u00a0\u03bcM. Among them, compounds 2F3 with IC<sub>50</sub> value at 24.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.44\u00a0\u03bcM and 1F4 with IC<sub>50</sub> value at 30.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59\u00a0\u03bcM showed about 20 times stronger than the positive control acarbose with an IC<sub>50</sub> at 536.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.25\u00a0\u03bcM in \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory assays."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Ltd.
