The name of \"N\u00fcwei\" was first carried out in the book of Sheng Nong's Herbal Classic. Its effects included two aspects\uff1a one was similar to \"Weirui\"(Polygonati Odorati Rhizome\uff0c \"Yuzhu\")\uff0c that was tonifying\uff0c nourishing one's vitality\uff0c removing wind and dampness\uff0c settling five organs\uff0c making body lightness\uff0c keeping longevity and not being hungry; the second was alike to \"Huangjing\" recorded in the book of Ming Yi Bie Lu(Appendant Records of Famous Physicians). Specifically\uff0c \"Weirui\" possesses the therapeutic effect of \"N\u00fcwei\"\uff0c while \"Huangjing\" possesses the tonic effect of \" N\u00fcwei\". Thereafter\uff0c the following ancient Chinese herbal texts kept those two names and function records. Accordingly\uff0c we hold the point of view that \"Huangjing\" was first carried out in the book of Sheng Nong's Herbal Classic in the synonym of \"N\u00fcwei\". \"Yuzhu\" included the \"Huangjing\" in ancient herbal text before Qing Dynasty\uff0c that was further confirmed by the research on change and development of the original plants. The identification between \"Yuzhu\" and \"Huangjing\" was based on the shape of rhizome and size before early Tang Dynasty. The shape was a key character and used up to now\uff0c but size was not reasonable. The opposite phyllotaxy was an important character of authentic \"Huangjing\" from Tang to Qing Dynasty. The seedling of Polygonatum sibiricum and P. kingianum\uff0c the adult plant of P. cyrtonema with alternate leaves were misused as \"Yuzhu\"(\"N\u00fcwei\" and \"Weirui\") at that time. Therefore\uff0c both \"Yuzhu\" and \"Huangjing\" should be used as key words during the search of ancient prescriptions and development of new drugs and health foods. The leaves\uff0c flowers\uff0c fruits and seedlings could be used as food or medicine other than the rhizomes in ancient China\uff0c but they haven't been developed in modern times. The culture of \"Huangjing\" had a long history starting with Tang Dynasty\uff0c which was recorded in Tang poetry. Then in Ming Dynasty\uff0c the culture method was described in Compendium of Materia Medica\uff0c that was cutting the rhizomes into 2 feet\uff0c planting sparsely(they would be grown densely in the next year)\uff0c or sowing the seeds. The harvesting and processing were first recorded in Ming Yi Bie Lu\uff1a \"harvest the roots in February\uff0c dry in the shade\". Then the processing method was changed to \"steaming and drying in the sun\uff0c repeatedly for nine times\" in Shi Liao Ben Cao(Dietetic Materia Medica) and \"harvesting in August as well\" in Ben Cao Tu Jing(Commentaries on the Illustrations). No breakthrough has been taken in the breeding of cultivars and key cultivation technologies yet. As to the geo-authentic habitats\uff0c Mount Songshan and Maoshan were firstly recorded as the best producing areas of \"Huangjing\" in Ben Cao Tu Jing. But Maoshan\uff0c Jiangsu province and Mount Songshan\uff0c Henan province\uff0c are not main producing areas in modern China. Consequently\uff0c the plantation plan of Polygonati Rhizome needs further study."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture\uff0c Zhejiang A & F University\uff0c Hangzhou 311300\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Jing-Jing", "Initials": "JJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture\uff0c Zhejiang A & F University\uff0c Hangzhou 311300\uff0c China."}], "LastName": "Si", "ForeName": "Jin-Ping", "Initials": "JP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbals as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Chinese Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polygonatum"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhizome"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "10", "Day": "2"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "3", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29600633", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180105.001"]}}]}
