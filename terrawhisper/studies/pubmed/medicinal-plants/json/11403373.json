Milk samples of cowpea, groundnut and soyabean and their complementations with cornpap were assessed chemically, organoleptically and anthropometrically. The protein contents of milk from cowpea, groundnut and soyabean were 1.18, 1.6, and 1.23% respectively. On separate complementation of the milk sources with cornpap, the low protein content of \"ogi\" was increased from 0.3% to 2.79% with cowpea; 3.0% with groundnut and 3.64% with soyabean. The fat content of the complementary feeds also increased remarkably. The anthropometric study revealed that there were significant differences P = 0.001 between the mean weight of children aged 13 to 18 (92 +/- 1.2) and 19 to 24 months (9.9 +/- 1.3) who were fed the three sources of milk with cornpap, and the control group of the same age groups (8.5 + 1.5; 9.3 + 1.11) who received nutrition education and no complementary feeds. Of the three sources of milk, groundnut milk was ranked as the most likeable, the easiest to prepare and the least costly by the nursing mothers. This study has shown that some of the deep rooted cultural food taboos that prohibit locally available and nutritious feeds to infants could be changed through practical food demonstrations."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ojofeitimi", "ForeName": "E O", "Initials": "EO"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Abiose", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ijadunola", "ForeName": "K T", "Initials": "KT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Pedro", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jinadu", "ForeName": "M K", "Initials": "MK"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Health", "NlmUniqueID": "8306569", "ISSNLinking": "0260-1060"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Fats"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dietary Proteins"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Arachis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cooking"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Fats"}, {"QualifierName": ["standards"], "DescriptorName": "Dietary Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Feeding Behavior"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Food Analysis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "economics", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Infant Food"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Infant Nutrition Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Milk"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Nutritive Value"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Glycine max"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Taste"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Weaning"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Zea mays"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "6", "Day": "14", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11403373", "10.1177/026010600101500106"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
