This study aimed to determine the effect of <i>jujube</i> lotion on the recovery of breast fissure. This double-blind clinical trial recruited 100 primiparous lactating women who were randomly divided into two groups. In Jujube group, mothers used 0.5 mL of Fruit Lotion, and in control group mothers applied 4-5 drops of their breast milk five times a day, after breastfeeding. Both groups were examined on the 7th and 14th days after childbirth. The damage severity was assessed using the Amir scale and the presence or absence of nipple discharge was recorded. A significant difference was observed between the two groups in the extent of nipple damage before intervention on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day after childbirth and after intervention on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14th days after childbirth <i>(P</i> = 0/02\u060c <i>P</i> = 0/000). No significant difference was observed in sore nipple discharge between the two groups before the study and on the 7th day, while a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups on the 14th day (<i>P</i> = 0/1, <i>P</i> = 0/01). The finding of this study revealed that the <i>Zizyphus jujube</i> fruits lotion heals nipple fissure faster and better than breast milk."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee,Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahrahmani", "ForeName": "Nasim", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery,Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Amir Ali Akbari", "ForeName": "Sedigheh", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mojab", "ForeName": "Faraz", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Public Health School, Kerman University of Medical Science, Kerman, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzai", "ForeName": "Moghadameh", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Student Research Committee,Department of Midwifery, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Shahrahmani", "ForeName": "Hadis", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Iran J Pharm Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101208407", "ISSNLinking": "1726-6882"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [{"ReferenceList": [], "Reference": [{"Citation": "Boskabadi H, Ramazanzadeh M, Zakerihamidi M, Omran FR.
