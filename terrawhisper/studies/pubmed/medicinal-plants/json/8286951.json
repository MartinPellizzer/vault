A spacer sequence linking the two genes was modified to provide a proteolytic site just before the first amino acid residue of mature pea reductase. When introduced into competent Escherichia coli cells and induced, the resulting plasmid (pGF205) directed the expression of a 60-kDa immunoreactive peptide that results from the fusion between glutathione S-transferase and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase sequences. The fused protein could be purified in a single step by selective absorption onto glutathione-agarose beads, followed by elution with free glutathione. It showed both transferase and reductase activities. Removal of the transferase portion by cleavage with the restriction protease Xa rendered ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase electrophoretically homogeneous. The purified transgenic enzyme showed kinetic and spectroscopic properties that were similar to those reported for the plant flavoprotein, indicating that, even when fused to the 27-kDa transferase portion, the reductase was still able to assemble FAD and to acquire an active conformation in the bacterial host. The expression-purification protocol employed here allows the isolation of up to 1 mg of active ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase/g of transformed cells. The system is potentially useful for the purification of activity-impaired forms of the flavoprotein."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina."}], "LastName": "Serra", "ForeName": "E C", "Initials": "EC"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Carrillo", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Krapp", "ForeName": "A R", "Initials": "AR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ceccarelli", "ForeName": "E A", "Initials": "EA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Protein Expr Purif", "NlmUniqueID": "9101496", "ISSNLinking": "1046-5928"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 1.18.1.2", "NameOfSubstance": "Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.5.1.18", "NameOfSubstance": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Endopeptidases"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Endopeptidases"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Glutathione Transferase"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8286951", "10.1006/prep.1993.1071", "S1046-5928(83)71071-5"]}}]}
