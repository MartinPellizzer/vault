It was found that externally fed protocatechuic aldehyde and caffeic acids were biotransformed to vanillin and capsaicin. It was noted that this culture biotransformed externally fed protocatechuic aldehyde to vanillin more than its conversion to capsaicin, whereas, caffeic acid-treated cultures accumulated more capsaicin than vanillin. The maximum accumulation of vanillin (5.63 mg l(-1)) and capsaicin (3.83 mg l(-1)) was recorded on the 6th and 15th day, respectively in immobilized C. frutescens cell cultures treated with protocatechuic aldehyde, which was 1.8 and 1.4 times higher than in protocatechuic aldehyde-treated freely suspended cell cultures. Caffeic acid-treated immobilized C. frutescens cell cultures accumulated maximum vanillin and capsaicin at 2.68 and 3.03 mg l(-1) culture, respectively, on the 9th and 12th day, which was 1.65 and 1.33 times over freely suspended cultures treated with caffeic acid. The addition of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, a methyl donor, to protocatechuic aldehyde-treated immobilized C. frutescens cell cultures, resulted in accumulation of vanillin (14.08 mg l(-1)) on the 4th day, which was 2.5-fold higher than that in cultures treated with protocatechuic aldehyde alone, suggesting the influence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine on O-methylation of protocatechuic aldehyde, resulting in more vanillin accumulation. The increase in vanillin accumulation was well correlated with an increase in specific activity of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in protocatechuic aldehyde and S-adenosyl-L-methionine-treated immobilized C. frutescens cell cultures. This study also provides an example for an alternative route to formation of vanillin by C. frutescens cell cultures."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Plant Cell Biotechnology Department, Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Rao", "ForeName": "S R", "Initials": "SR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ravishankar", "ForeName": "G A", "Initials": "GA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "J Biotechnol", "NlmUniqueID": "8411927", "ISSNLinking": "0168-1656"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Catechols"}, {"RegistryNumber": "4PVP2HCH4T", "NameOfSubstance": "protocatechualdehyde"}, {"RegistryNumber": "7LP2MPO46S", "NameOfSubstance": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "CHI530446X", "NameOfSubstance": "vanillin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Methyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.1.1.68", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeate O-methyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S07O44R1ZM", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsaicin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Benzaldehydes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biotransformation"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsaicin"}, {"QualifierName": ["cytology", "drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Capsicum"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Catechols"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Culture Techniques"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Methyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "S-Adenosylmethionine"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "3", "Day": "4", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "3", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10656328", "10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00177-7", "S0168-1656(99)00177-7"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
