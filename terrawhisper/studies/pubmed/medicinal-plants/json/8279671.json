The adverse effects of ethanol on the liver are now believed to be due to acetaldehyde formed as an intermediate metabolite of ethanol. Liv.52 has been shown to bring about faster elimination of acetaldehyde from the body and thus prevent alcoholic liver damage. Other toxic effects of alcohol may also be due to acetaldehyde and may be prevented by Liv.52. In this study, rats were given 20% (v/v) ethanol in drinking water, during the gestation period, and the effect on maternal body weight and fetal outcome was noted. The protective effect of Liv.52 administration during the gestation period was studied. The results show that ethanol ingestion caused a decrease in gestational weight gain, total fetal weight, and number of live fetuses. There were increases in resorptions. Liv.52 administration reduced the deleterious effects of ethanol. The concentration of acetaldehyde in the amniotic fluid of ethanol-consuming animals was 0.727 microgram/ml. Liv.52 administration lowered it to 0.244 microgram/ml. The protective effect of Liv.52 could be due to the rapid elimination of acetaldehyde."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "R & D Centre, Himalaya Drug Company, Bangalore, India."}], "LastName": "Gopumadhavan", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jagadeesh", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Chauhan", "ForeName": "B L", "Initials": "BL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kulkarni", "ForeName": "R D", "Initials": "RD"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Alcohol Clin Exp Res", "NlmUniqueID": "7707242", "ISSNLinking": "0145-6008"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "3K9958V90M", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethanol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "54847-94-8", "NameOfSubstance": "Liv 52"}, {"RegistryNumber": "GO1N1ZPR3B", "NameOfSubstance": "Acetaldehyde"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Acetaldehyde"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Amniotic Fluid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Body Weight"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Ethanol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1993", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["8279671", "10.1111/j.1530-0277.1993.tb05669.x"]}}]}
