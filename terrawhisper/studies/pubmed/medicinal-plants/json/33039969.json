It improves the comfort of patient life by eliminating the need for repeated dialysis. The aim of the study was to examine the correlation between tacrolimus (TAC) dose and genetic variation for interleukin-10 (IL-10) and its effect on the therapeutic outcome. In addition, the correlations between the IL-10 polymorphism andthe clinical and the biochemical parameters of TAC patients were also analyzed. The study included 209 subjects after kidney transplantation, who received TAC every 12 and 24\u00a0h. Drug concentrations in blood, selected morphological and biochemical parameters, and the genetic variation of IL-10 (-1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G) which may affect immunosuppressant dosage and risk of acute graft rejection were analyzed. Genetic analyses were performed using real-time PCR. No significant correlations between the clinical and the biochemical parameters and IL-10-1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism for patients receiving TAC after kidney transplantation were found. The analysis of the correlation between TAC dose and IL-10 genetic variation for the -1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism revealed that patients with the AA genotype required lower immunosuppressive drug doses (AA: 3.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.38\u00a0mg/day vs AG: 6.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.10\u00a0mg/day, GG: 4.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.01\u00a0mg/day). Furthermore, frequencies of the genotypes for the IL-10 -1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism were characterized by a significantly higher frequency of the AA genotype among TAC 24 as compared to TAC 12 patients. The results of the study indicated that the IL-10 -1082A\u00a0>\u00a0G polymorphism may in fact influence the TAC dose. The biochemical parameters of the renal profile in relation to the IL-10 genetic variations were not indicative of higher risk of acute rejection after transplantation."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.
