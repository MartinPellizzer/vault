How on enhancing sexual function effect, mice were administered gavage by the extracts from three materials, serum testosterone and nitric oxide(NO) levels in male mice were detected and the changes of sexual organs were measured. Results showed that testosterone level, NO level and sexual organs weights of Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. treatment were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) higher than those of Cynomorium songaricum Rupr. and Morindae officinalis F. C. How treatments, which indicated that Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. was more effective to improve sexual function than the other two plants. Subsequently, Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. was selected for the second experiment, with shenbao syrup as a positive reference drug, the male sexual behaviours and female vaginal copulation plug were measured. Results showed that Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. treatment exhibited higher male capture frequency, mount frequency and vaginal plug rate, and lower capture latency and mount latency than shenbao syrup treatment, which indicated that Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. was effective to enhance male mice sexual function. Thus, this finding might bring into perspective the treatment strategy for those doctors who treat erectile dysfunction and might be suitable for use in functional food."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Gu", "ForeName": "Shuang", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Zhou", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-3924-1808"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "College of Food Science and Biotechnology, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Xiangyang", "Initials": "X"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "2017SIAR204", "Agency": "First-Class Discipline of Food Science and Engineering of Zhejiang Gongshang University", "Country": ""}, {"GrantID": "GN18C200026", "Agency": "Non-Profit Applied Research Project of Zhejiang Province, P.R.
