Type 2 diabetes contributes to a vast 85-90% of the diabetes incidences while 10-15% of patients suffer from type 1 diabetes. These two predominant forms of DM cause a significant loss of functional pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass causing different degrees of insulin deficiency, most likely, due to increased \u03b2-cell apoptosis. Treatment options involve the use of insulin sensitisers, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, and \u03b2-cell secretagogues which are often expensive, limited in efficacy and carry detrimental adverse effects. Cost-effective options for treatment exists in the form of herbal drugs, however, scientific validations of these widely used medicinal plants are still underway. Alternative splicing (AS) is a co-ordinated post-transcriptional process in which a single gene generates multiple mRNA transcripts which results in increased amounts of functionally different protein isoforms and in some cases aberrant splicing leads to metabolic disease. In this review, we explore the association of AS with metabolic alterations in DM and the biological significance of the abnormal splicing of some pathogenic diabetes-related genes. An understanding of the molecular mechanism behind abnormally spliced transcripts will aid in the development of new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic tools."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2017 Society for Endocrinology."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ResearchInnovation & Engagements Portfolio, Mangosuthu University of Technology, Durban, South Africa Zodwa.Dlamini@mut.ac.za."}], "LastName": "Dlamini", "ForeName": "Zodwa", "Initials": "Z"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ResearchInnovation & Engagements Portfolio, Mangosuthu University of Technology, Durban, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Mokoena", "ForeName": "Fortunate", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "ResearchInnovation & Engagements Portfolio, Mangosuthu University of Technology, Durban, South Africa."}], "LastName": "Hull", "ForeName": "Rodney", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "J Mol Endocrinol", "NlmUniqueID": "8902617", "ISSNLinking": "0952-5041"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Alternative Splicing"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Diabetes Mellitus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Genome-Wide Association Study"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Targeted Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Transcriptome"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "5", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "7", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28716821", "10.1530/JME-17-0049", "59/2/R93"]}}]}
