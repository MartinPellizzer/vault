Effectiveness of both regimens was monitored by serum prolactin levels, clinical evaluation of the degree of breast engorgement and milk production and the analgesic intake. While both bromocriptine and jasmine flowers brought about a significant reduction in serum prolactin, the decrease was significantly greater with bromocriptine. However, clinical parameters such as breast engorgement, milk production and analgesic intake showed the 2 modes of therapy to be equally effective. The failure rates of the 2 regimens to suppress lactation were similar; however, rebound lactation occurred in a small proportion of women treated with bromocriptine. Jasmine flowers seem to be an effective and inexpensive method of suppressing puerperal lactation and can be used as an alternative in situations where cost and nonavailability restrict the use of bromocriptine."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, India."}], "LastName": "Shrivastav", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "George", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Balasubramaniam", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Jasper", "ForeName": "M P", "Initials": "MP"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Thomas", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kanagasabhapathy", "ForeName": "A S", "Initials": "AS"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Australia", "MedlineTA": "Aust N Z J Obstet Gynaecol", "NlmUniqueID": "0001027", "ISSNLinking": "0004-8666"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3A64E3G5ZO", "NameOfSubstance": "Bromocriptine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-62-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Prolactin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Bromocriptine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fetal Death"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "India"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Lactation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Prolactin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3214386", "10.1111/j.1479-828x.1988.tb01614.x"]}}]}
