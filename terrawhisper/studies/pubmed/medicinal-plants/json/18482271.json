The characteristics and outcomes of the chosen articles were displayed for further analysis and the quality of each study was also evaluated according to the widely acknowledged criteria. P<0.05 was defined as statistically significant in all enrolled trials.", "Ten qualified studies (eight from China, one from Japan and the other from the USA) with various outcomes such as liver cancer, cirrhosis and fatty liver disease were finally chosen. Among them, study designs differed in that there were four randomized-controlled clinical trials, two cohort, one case-control and three cross-sectional studies. The heterogeneity in the study design, outcomes, cofounders and amount of tea consumption precluded further meta-analysis. Nevertheless, eight studies showed a significant protective role of green tea against various liver diseases as determined by relative risk/odds ratio or P-value and among them, four studies showed a positive correlation between green tea intake and attenuation of liver disease. Moreover, the other two studies also presented the protective tendency of green tea against liver disease.", "An increased consumption of green tea may reduce the risk of liver disease."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Digestive Department, the First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Xi", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Ruo-heng", "Initials": "RH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "You-ming", "Initials": "YM"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review", "Systematic Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Liver Int", "NlmUniqueID": "101160857", "ISSNLinking": "1478-3223"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Tea"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Camellia sinensis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["prevention & control"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Tea"}], "NumberOfReferences": "41"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2008", "Month": "5", "Day": "17", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["18482271", "10.1111/j.1478-3231.2008.01776.x", "LIV1776"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
