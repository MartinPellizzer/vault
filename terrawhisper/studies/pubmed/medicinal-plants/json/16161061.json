They also inhibited radiation induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes effectively with IC(50) values less than 15 microg/mL. The extracts were found to possess the ability to scavenge free radicals such as DPPH and superoxide. As the phenolic compounds present in these extracts are mostly responsible for their radical scavenging activity, the total phenolic contents present in these extracts were determined and expressed in terms of gallic acid equivalents and were found to vary from 33% to 44%. These studies revealed that all three constituents of triphala are active and they exhibit slightly different activities under different conditions. T1 shows greater efficiency in lipid peroxidation and plasmid DNA assay, while T2 has greater radical scavenging activity. Thus their mixture, triphala, is expected to be more efficient due to the combined activity of the individual components."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Radiation Chemistry and Chemical Dynamics Division, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai-400085, India."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Naik", "ForeName": "G H", "Initials": "GH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Priyadarsini", "ForeName": "K I", "Initials": "KI"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Bhagirathi", "ForeName": "R G", "Initials": "RG"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mishra", "ForeName": "K P", "Initials": "KP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Banavalikar", "ForeName": "M M", "Initials": "MM"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Mohan", "ForeName": "Hari", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Phytother Res", "NlmUniqueID": "8904486", "ISSNLinking": "0951-418X"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antioxidants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Picrates"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "11062-77-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Superoxides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9007-49-2", "NameOfSubstance": "DNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "DFD3H4VGDH", "NameOfSubstance": "1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Antioxidants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biphenyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "DNA"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Free Radical Scavengers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Inhibitory Concentration 50"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Lipid Peroxidation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Ayurvedic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Microsomes, Liver"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phyllanthus emblica"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Picrates"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "chemistry", "pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Superoxides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Terminalia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "12", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "9", "Day": "15", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16161061", "10.1002/ptr.1515"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
