Extracts of the whole plant had shown an abortifacient effect in mice. Maximal activity was in the benzene extract which was tested. The drug, in olive oil, was given orally to rabbits in doses of 50 mg/kg of body weight on the 8th day postcoitum. Laparotomy was done on the 11th day. No implantation sites were found. However, ovaries contained prominent corpus luteum, indicating that the drug had prevented pregnancy. In rats, the drug was given orally as a single dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight on the 6th or 7th day after mating. No effect was observed. In mice the drug was given at a single dose of either 10, 15, 25, or 50 mg/kg of body weight. For toxicity tests in mice, a single dose of 1000 mg/kg of body weight was given. After 1 month animals were autopsied and the organs examined. The drug was nontoxic. For a chronic toxicity test 75 mg/kg of body weight was given every 21 days. After 6 months of drug treatment, blood and tissue samples were examined. No toxic effects were observed. For a teratogenic study, 15 mated female mice were fed 10 or 25 mg/kg of body weight on Day 6 of gestation. 3 generations of offspring showed no malformations. In mice, abortifacient effects were noted with a maximum activity at 50 mg/kg of body weight. The drug showed no estrogenic, antiestrogenic, or androgenic effects in mice. Progesterone or pituitary extract given along with the drug did not prevent abortions in mice. The drug was species-specific in that no abortifacient effect was found in rats."]}], "CitationSubset": ["IM"], "OtherID": ["773987", "00042779"], "GeneralNote": [], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Abortifacient Agents", "Abortion, Drug Induced", "Abortion, Induced", "Animals, Laboratory", "Clinical Research", "Comparative Studies", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Evaluation", "Family Planning", "Fertility Control, Postconception", "Health", "Health Services", "Ingredients And Chemicals", "Medicine", "Plants, Medicinal--administraction and dosage", "Plants, Medicinal--side effects", "Research Methodology", "Studies"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "606650", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1978", "Month": "04", "Day": "26"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2003", "Month": "11", "Day": "14"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0019-5189", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "15", "Issue": "10", "PubDate": {"Year": "1977", "Month": "Oct"}}, "Title": "Indian journal of experimental biology", "ISOAbbreviation": "Indian J Exp Biol"}, "ArticleTitle": "Abortifacient principle of Achyranthes aspera Linn.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "856", "EndPage": "858", "MedlinePgn": "856-8"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Pakrashi", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Bhattacharya", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "Indian J Exp Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "0233411", "ISSNLinking": "0019-5189"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Abortifacient Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "10", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["606650"]}}]}
