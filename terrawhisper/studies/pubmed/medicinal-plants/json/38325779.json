Here, functional kiwi peel composite, manganese dioxide decorated kiwi peel powder (MKPP), is proposed for the removal of Pb<sup>2+</sup> effectively. The adsorption of Pb<sup>2+</sup> in aqueous solution is a highly selective and endothermic process and kinetically follows a pseudo-second-order model, which can reach equilibrium with the capacity of 192.7\u00a0mg/g within 10\u00a0min. Comprehensive factors of hydration energy, charge-to-radius ratio and softness of Pb<sup>2+</sup> make a stronger affinity between MKPP and Pb<sup>2+</sup>. The possible adsorption mechanism involves covalent bond, electrostatic force and chelation, etc. MKPP can be efficiently regenerated and reused with high adsorption efficiency after five cycles. Besides, MKPP can remove over 97% of Pb<sup>2+</sup> from real water samples. MKPP can also alleviate lead poisoning to a certain extent and make the Pb level of TCM extract meet the safety standard. This work highlights that MKPP is a promising adsorbent for the removal of Pb<sup>2+</sup> and provides an efficient strategy for reusing kiwi peel as well as dealing with the problem of Pb pollution."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2024 Elsevier Inc.
