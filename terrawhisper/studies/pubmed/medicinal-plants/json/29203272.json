Enterocyte-like differentiated MCE301 cells were incubated in media comprising a hot water extract of licorice products for 24h, and the concentrations of G-CSF in the media were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).", "Licorice extract induced G-CSF secretion in MCE301 cells, and the active ingredients of licorice were high molecular compounds. Although the roasted licorice extract exhibited the activity similar to that of the unprocessed licorice extract, honey-roasted licorice extracts exhibited a significantly higher inducible effect on G-CSF secretion in the cells than that of unprocessed or roasted licorice extracts without pretreatment with honey. This enhanced activity was dependent on the temperature and heating time.", "The enhanced inducible effect of honey-roasted licorice on G-CSF secretion might be attributed to the combined effect of licorice-derived high molecular compounds and heated-honey-derived compounds. The results of this study can scientifically explain the objective of processing via honey-roasting in TCM theory."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.
