The carbon dots used in this study were derived from the polyphenol-enriched extract of pomegranate peel, as established in previous work, as the reinforcing and antioxidant agent to enhance the physicochemical and biological properties of the nanofibers were used. The fabricated nanofibers were characterized using FE-SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and DSC analysis. The FE-SEM results revealed that an increase in the number of CDs in the nanofibers led to a decrease in diameter (809.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a077.1\u00a0nm to 273.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.1\u00a0nm). Furthermore, surface modification caused a significant reduction in the amount of surface roughness of the nanofibers. Incorporating CDs not only reduced the scaffold diameter but also improved its mechanical properties and promoted the growth of fibroblast cells. The ultimate tensile strength of scaffolds with and without CDs was 2.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0MPa and 1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0MPa respectively. The influence of CDs amount on the properties of nanofibers showed that the swelling capacity and degradability of nanofibers can be adjusted by changing the range of CDs. Apart from the aforementioned benefits of incorporating CDs in improving nanofiber properties, their exceptional antioxidant properties can be harnessed for protecting nanofibers against oxidation and as a healing agent in wound dressings."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
