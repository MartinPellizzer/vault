Among them, seven are previously undescribed, including a picane-type [i.e., 14(13\u00a0\u2192\u00a012)abeo-12\u03b1H-serratane] (neoveitchin A) and a serratane-type (neoveitchin B) triterpenoids, and an abietane-type (neoveitchin C) as well as four labdane-type (potalarxins A-D) diterpenoids. Their structures and absolute configurations were established by extensive spectroscopic methods and/or X-ray diffraction analyses. All isolates were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against the human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). Serrat-14-en-3\u03b1,21\u03b2-diol, betulinic acid, 3\u03b2-hydroxy-11-ursen-13(28)-olide, ursolic acid, and oleanolic acid were found to have considerable inhibitory effects against PTP1B, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.1 to 18.1\u00a0\u03bcM. The interactions of the bioactive triterpenoids with PTP1B were thereafter performed by employing molecular docking studies. In addition, 7-oxo-dehydroabietic acid (an abietane-type diterpenoid) and mangiferonic acid (a cycloartane-type triterpenoid) inhibited acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1), with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 3.4 and 6.6\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier Ltd.
