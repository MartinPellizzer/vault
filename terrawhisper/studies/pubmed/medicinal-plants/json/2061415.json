In the Sri Lankan tea laborers, both supra- and subgingival calculus formation started before age 14 years. At 40 years of age, all participants and almost all teeth and tooth surfaces had calculus. Tea laborers who both smoked tobacco and chewed betel had significantly higher calculus scores than those who only had one of these habits, and those who neither chewed nor smoked had the lowest calculus scores. Teeth with calculus showed a significantly higher rate of loss of attachment than teeth that remained calculus free. For the Norwegians who had enjoyed regular dental care throughout their lives, supragingival calculus did not increase in frequency from adolescence to the forties. Approximately 70% of the interproximal surfaces were calculus free after 40-50 years of age. Subgingival calculus scores, although low, showed some increase with longer times of exposure. On average, each person had 0.4 interproximal surfaces with subgingival calculus as they approached 50 years of age. In this Norwegian population, subgingival calculus had no impact on loss of attachment."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892."}], "LastName": "Anerud", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "L\u00f6e", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Boysen", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Clin Periodontol", "NlmUniqueID": "0425123", "ISSNLinking": "0303-6979"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Age Factors"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Areca"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "etiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Dental Calculus"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dental Care"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology", "physiopathology"], "DescriptorName": "Gingival Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Norway"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Observer Variation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oral Hygiene Index"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reproducibility of Results"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Risk Factors"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Smoking"}, {"QualifierName": ["epidemiology"], "DescriptorName": "Sri Lanka"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2061415", "10.1111/j.1600-051x.1991.tb01128.x"]}}]}
