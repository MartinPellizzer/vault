A wide range of in-vitro activities, in particular their antioxidant properties, have been studied intensively. However, in-vivo-data on absorption, bioavailability and metabolism after oral intake are scarce and contradictory. In order to examine the metabolism and renal excretion of these compounds a standardized extract from horsetail (Equisetum arvense) was administered to 11 volunteers following a flavonoid-free diet for 8 d. 24 h urine samples were collected and analyzed by HPLC-DAD. The putative quercetin metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid or 3,4-dihydroxytoluene could not be detected in urine in any sample. The endogenous amount of homovanillic acid, generally regarded as one of the main quercetin metabolites, was 4 +/- 1 mg/d and did not increase significantly. However, hippuric acid, the glycine conjugate of benzoic acid, increased twofold after drug intake. Thus, the degradation to benzoic acid derivatives rather than phenylacetic acid derivatives seems to be a predominant route of metabolism. The results of this pilot study give rise to additional, substantial pharmacokinetic investigations in humans."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Bayerische Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Germany."}], "LastName": "Graefe", "ForeName": "E U", "Initials": "EU"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Veit", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Phytomedicine", "NlmUniqueID": "9438794", "ISSNLinking": "0944-7113"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9IKM0I5T1E", "NameOfSubstance": "Quercetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "U2S3A33KVM", "NameOfSubstance": "caffeic acid"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Biological Availability"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Caffeic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Coumaric Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Equisetum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pilot Projects"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics", "urine"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacokinetics"], "DescriptorName": "Quercetin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Reference Values"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10589442", "10.1016/S0944-7113(99)80015-4", "S0944-7113(99)80015-4"]}}]}
