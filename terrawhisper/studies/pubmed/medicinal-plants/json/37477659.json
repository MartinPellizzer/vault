Additionally, many herbal remedies are known to reduce inflammation and boost immunity, making them an effective preventive measure against viral infections. The study aims to evaluate the perception of medicinal herbs and healthy foods during the pandemic period among Saudi patients. Furthermore, the study seeks to understand how people view medicinal herbs and healthy foods as a means of mitigating the effects of the pandemic and how that perception varies across different demographics. It will also assess the availability of these options in the country and how they have been utilized by the population. A cross-sectional online study was conducted among COVID-19-infected Saudi population at the University of Tabuk, Saudi Arabia. The perception of the use of medicinal herbs and the effect of healthy foods on the treatment or reduction of symptoms of COVID-19 was evaluated. The efficacy of 23 herbal products was evaluated. A total of 909 participants with COVID-19 infection were surveyed; 86.14% were women, 93.73% were between the ages of 18-60, 51.05% were unemployed, 57.43% had a bachelor's degree, and 90.64% were non-smokers. Study participants used medicinal herbs, slime drinks, and medicinal herb tea to reduce coronavirus infection risk by 67.11, 43.56, and 7.18%, respectively. Gender, education, consuming healthy food, and drinking medicinal herbs displayed significant variation among the studied participants (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The study revealed a prevalence of ginger (62.9%), lemon (51.1%), mint (46.8%), honey (45.7%), and anise (43.0%) as commonly used medicinal herb products. To conclude, the survey found a link between gender, education, consuming healthy foods, and drinking medicinal herbs to reduce infection symptoms among Saudi Arabians. Accordingly, lifestyle choices can have a positive impact on health, even in the face of a challenging environment."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2023.
