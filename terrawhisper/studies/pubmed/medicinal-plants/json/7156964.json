A group of patients with evident cardiac insufficiency received a daily maintenance dosage of digitalis (2 tablets of 0.1 mg methyldigoxin) from the outset. After 7, 15 and 30 days the plasma concentration of methyldigoxin was measured. Objective and subjective signs of cardiac insufficiency were noted. In 28 of 29 patients the therapeutic plasma level (0.8-2.0 ng/ml) was achieved with a mean plasma digitalis concentration of 1.47 +/- 0.4 ng/ml. A clinical improvement was observed in 18 patients. On the 15th and 30th day of treatment the mean plasma level of methyldigoxin showed no significant difference: X15 = 1.51 +/- 0.57 ng/ml and X30 = 1.40 +/- 0.46 ng/ml. The measured plasma values were not influenced by the patient's weight or age. In 6 patients with renal insufficiency a clear correlation between the plasma level of methyldigoxin and the creatinine level was observed. The evaluation of ECG signs showed only minimal alterations of conduction and repolarisation. On the basis of these results conclusions are drawn with regard to the clinical value and use of this therapy."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Salvad\u00e8", "ForeName": "G", "Initials": "G"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Tartini", "ForeName": "R", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Moccetti", "ForeName": "T", "Initials": "T"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "Digitalisierung ohne S\u00e4ttigungsdosis mit Methyldigoxin.
