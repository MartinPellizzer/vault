The doctors and patients judged the effectiveness in both groups to be comparable. After 6 weeks the effectiveness of the willow bark extract tended to be assessed as better than in the group undergoing conventional therapy. Also in the subgroup of chronically sick patients (>3 months), after 6 weeks the effectiveness of both forms of treatment was comparable; however, the effect was slower to set in the willow bark group than in the reference group. Doctors and patients assessed the tolerance of the willow bark extract to be better than the conventional therapy.
