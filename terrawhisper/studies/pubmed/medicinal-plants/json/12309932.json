There are 5000 varieties of medicinal herbs cataloged, some more effective than western drugs. China's barefoot doctors investigate diseases and collect effective drugs, one of which is Muching which has been highly effective in treating chronic bronchitis. Salvia miltiorrhiza, used in ancient times to activate blood circulation, is used to treat coronary artery diseases and has proved effective in 87% of angina pectoris cases. Medicinal herbs are used to treat burns, hypertension, and cancer and, although the herbs are readily available and inexpensive, they work slowly. Using medicinal herbs, a Shansi Medical College affiliated hospital successfully treated over 800 cases of extra-uterine pregnancy and, in 90% of the cases, no surgery was performed. Treatment showed medicinal herbs checked bleeding, improved circulation, and eradicated blood clots. Research is being conducted with herbal prescriptions to find safer, more effective and convenient contraceptives for men and women. A breakthrough for the Institute of Medicine of the Chinese Academy of Medicine Sciences was seen in the successful cultivation of gastrodia elata which has been used for 2000 years to treat dizziness, headaches, and infantile coma."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["795886", "00072609"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: UNESCO Courier"], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Asia", "Barefoot Doctors", "Cancer", "China", "Contraception", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Diseases", "Eastern Asia", "Endometrial Cancer", "Family Planning", "Health", "Health Personnel", "Health Services", "Heart Diseases", "Hypertension", "Medicine", "Neoplasms", "Plants, Medicinal", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy, Ectopic", "Vascular Diseases"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "12309932", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1980", "Month": "06", "Day": "10"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2022", "Month": "12", "Day": "07"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"JournalIssue": {"Volume": "7", "PubDate": {"Year": "1979", "Month": "Jul"}}, "Title": "The Unesco courier", "ISOAbbreviation": "UNESCO Cour"}, "ArticleTitle": "China: a new medicine born of tradition.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "25", "EndPage": "27", "MedlinePgn": "25-7"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wen", "ForeName": "W", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "France", "MedlineTA": "UNESCO Cour", "NlmUniqueID": "21340440R"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Community Health Workers"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Contraception"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Delivery of Health Care"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Developing Countries"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Endometrial Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Asia, Eastern"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Personnel"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Health Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Heart Diseases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hypertension"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Neoplasms"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy Complications"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pregnancy, Ectopic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Vascular Diseases"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2002", "Month": "10", "Day": "9", "Hour": "4", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["12309932"]}}]}
