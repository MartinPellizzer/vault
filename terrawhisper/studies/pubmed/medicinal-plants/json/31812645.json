There prevails considerable ambiguity in defining what a blood purifier is.", "The purpose of this review is to firstly define what a blood purifier is in the context of African traditional medicine and compare to other cultural and westernized interpretations. Thereafter, this study identifies traditionally used medicinal plants used as blood purifiers in southern Africa and correlates these species to scientific studies, which may support evidence for these \"blood purifying plant species\".", "Ethnobotanical books and review articles were used to identify medicinal plants used for blood purification. Databases such as Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Google Scholar were used to source scientific articles. An evaluation was made to try correlate traditional use to scientific value of the plant species.", "One hundred and fifty nine plant species have been documented as traditional remedies for blood purification. Most of the plant species have some pharmacological activity, however, very little link to the traditional use for blood purification. There has been some justification of the link between blood purification and the use as an antimicrobial and this has been explored in many of the plant species identified as blood purifiers. Other pharmacological studies specifically pertaining to the blood require further attention.", "Irrespective of the ambiguity of interpretation, medicinal plants used to \"cleanse the blood\", play an important holistic role in traditional medicine and this review with recommendations for further study provides some value of exploring this theme in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
