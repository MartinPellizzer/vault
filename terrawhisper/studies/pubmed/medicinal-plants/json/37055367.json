These compounds not only help the endophytes to outcompete other plant-associated microbes or pathogens through quorum sensing, but also enable them to surmount the plant immune system. However, only a very few studies have described the interlink between various biochemical and molecular factors of host-microbe interactions involved in the production of these pharmacological metabolites. The peculiar mechanisms by which endophytes modulate plant physiology and metabolism through elicitors, as well as how they use transitional compounds of primary and secondary metabolism as nutrients and precursors for the synthesis of new compounds or enhancing existing metabolites, are still less understood. This study thus attempts to address the aspects of synthesis of such metabolites used in therapeutics by the endophytes in the light of their ecological significance, adaptation, and intercommunity interactions. Our study explores how endophytes adapt to the specific host environment, especially in medicinal plants that produce metabolites with pharmacological potential and simultaneously modulate host gene expression for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. We also discuss the differential interactions of fungal and bacterial endophytes with their hosts."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2023.
