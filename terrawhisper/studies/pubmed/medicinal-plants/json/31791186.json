The blood samples were collected according to the time schedule. The levels of quercitrin, astragalin, afzelin and taxifolin in the plasma at designated time points were determined using an HPLC-MS/MS method. Various pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental methods. After the administration of the Chinese herb <i>Polygonum orientale</i> inflorescence extracts, the <i>C</i><sub>max</sub>, AUC, as well as MRT, increased, while CL decreased, in MIRI model compared to the sham-operated animals.These results suggest that the pathological damage of ischemia-reperfusion had a significant impact on the pharmacological effects of <i>Polygonum orientale</i> inflorescence extracts on ischemic heart disease.The method had been successfully applied to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of quercitrin, astragalin, afzelin and taxifolin in rat plasma after the oral administration of Chinese herb <i>Polygonum orientale</i> inflorescence extracts in rats."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key
