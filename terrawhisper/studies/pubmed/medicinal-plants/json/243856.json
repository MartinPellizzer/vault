They were permitted to watch 3 operations performed under traditional anesthesia. A thyroidictomy and removal of an ovarian cyst were performed under herbal anesthesia, and an operation for cancer of the esophagus was performed with acupuncture anesthesia. The patients were conscious throughout the procedures and appeared to be confortable. The herbal anesthesia was made by combining a substance derived from thorn apple flowers with a muscle relaxant. These traditional methods of anesthesia permitted the patients to cooperate with the surgeon during the operation. The patients suffered no after effects from the anesthesia, and the group was told that recovery time was shorter than when Western forms of anesthesia were used. The tour group also visited the nurses' training school and were informed that 1) there were 200 students currently enrolled in the school and 2) nursing training consisted of 1 1/2 years of academic work followed by 1/2 year of on the job training. The group discussed family planning services with hospital personnel and learned 1) IUD insertions were performed by trained midwives; 2) midwives conducted childbirth classes for pregnant women; 3) labor was induced primarily with herbal medicines; and 4) women were prepared to cope with labor pain through ideological education although acupuncture and pethidine were sometimes used to reduce pain."]}], "CitationSubset": [], "OtherID": ["776927", "00074094"], "GeneralNote": ["TJ: NURSING MIRROR."], "SpaceFlightMission": [], "KeywordList": [["Acupuncture", "Anesthesia", "Asia", "China", "Delivery Of Health Care", "Developing Countries", "Eastern Asia", "Health", "Health Facilities", "Health Services", "Hospitals", "Maternal Health Services", "Maternal-child Health Services", "Midwives", "National Health Services", "Nurses", "Primary Health Care", "Treatment"]], "InvestigatorList": [], "PMID": "243856", "DateCompleted": {"Year": "1978", "Month": "01", "Day": "27"}, "DateRevised": {"Year": "2007", "Month": "11", "Day": "15"}, "Article": {"Language": ["eng"], "ArticleDate": [], "ELocationID": [], "Journal": {"ISSN": "0029-6511", "JournalIssue": {"Volume": "145", "Issue": "25", "PubDate": {"Year": "1977", "Month": "Dec", "Day": "22"}}, "Title": "Nursing mirror", "ISOAbbreviation": "Nurs Mirror"}, "ArticleTitle": "NM goes to China:4.", "Pagination": {"StartPage": "6", "EndPage": "8", "MedlinePgn": "6-8"}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Young", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nurs Mirror", "NlmUniqueID": "7708429", "ISSNLinking": "0029-6511"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acupuncture Therapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anesthesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Datura stramonium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Family Planning Services"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["instrumentation"], "DescriptorName": "Otolaryngology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Periodicals as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Surgical Procedures, Operative"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "22"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1977", "Month": "12", "Day": "22", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["243856"]}}]}
