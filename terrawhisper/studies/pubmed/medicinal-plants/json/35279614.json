They are reported for anti-cancer, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-microbial, and many other significant medicinal attributes. However, the current use of this genus is limited mainly to ornamental and recreational purposes. Recent studies have reported several novel compounds like phloroglucinol derivatives, terpenes, phenolics, etc., from Callistemon spp., which have great medical significance. Further, there is a surge of recent studies reporting novel pharmacological properties of Callistemon. The number of review studies discussing the underlying molecular mechanism behind the pharmacological action of Callistemon is quite limited.", "The literature search for studies published from 1991 to 2021 using Google scholar and PubMed were selected. The review documented relevant literature focused on Callistemon spp exhibiting significant pharmacological effects.", "This review deals with the pharmacological properties of Callistemon and the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for protective effect in several pathophysiological conditions. This study updated the current information regarding the medicinal importance of Callistemon spp. for research and the public community.", "The preliminary studies, interrogating pharmacological properties of Callistemon spp., hold great promise and demand further research to decipher the mode of action. More and more research are needed in this direction to explore the full potential of the genus Callistemon as a medicinal herb."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022 Elsevier GmbH.
