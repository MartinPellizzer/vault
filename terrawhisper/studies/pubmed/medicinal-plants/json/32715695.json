(Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is the most serious pest of <i>Lycium barbarum</i>. The young flower buds of <i>L. barbarum</i> are attractive to females of <i>Jaapiella</i> sp. for oviposition in the field. In this study, we compared response of <i>Jaapiella</i> sp. to volatiles from flower buds of <i>L. barbarum</i> at different stages, and clarified the crucial semiochemicals attracting <i>Jaapiella</i> sp. to lay eggs. Volatiles from young and mature flower buds were collected using SPME, and then identified and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Both electrophysiological and behavior experiments were conducted to measure the attraction of eight synthetic compounds to females and screen the crucial components based on gas chromatography-electroantennogram detection (GC-EAD) and Y-tube bioassays, respectively. Results showed that qualitative and quantitative diffe-rences between two odor profiles. Consistent electroantennographic response was observed for eight compounds from headspace collections, of which five synthetic compounds (3-carene, camphene, terpinolene, d-limonene, and (+)-pinene) were essential for significant preference or avoidance. Our results indicated that these compounds from <i>L. barbarum</i> flower buds could be effective candidates as oviposition attractant or repellents of <i>Jaapiella</i> sp., which would be helpful in the exploitation of new control agent to <i>Jaapiella</i> sp. in the field."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Fan", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Chang-Qing", "Initials": "CQ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Jun", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Mei", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Key Laboratory for Silviculture and Conservation of Ministry of Education, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing 100083, China."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Peng-Fei", "Initials": "PF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Liu", "ForeName": "Sai", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "China Resources Sanjiu Medical & Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shenzhen 518110, Guangdong, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Jian-Ling", "Initials": "JL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."}], "LastName": "Qiao", "ForeName": "Hai-Li", "Initials": "HL"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"], "VernacularTitle": "\u67b8\u675e\u7ea2\u763f\u868a\u5bf9\u5bc4\u4e3b\u690d\u7269\u6325\u53d1\u7269\u7684\u7535\u751f\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Ying Yong Sheng Tai Xue Bao", "NlmUniqueID": "9425159", "ISSNLinking": "1001-9332"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Diptera"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Oviposition"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Volatile Organic Compounds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "7", "Day": "29", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["32715695", "10.13287/j.1001-9332.202007.040"]}}]}
