By substituting N-H of the ligands, we demonstrated that the N-H moiety was essential for asymmetric hydrogenation and that without the N-H moiety asymmetric hydrogenation could not proceed, based on which a proposed mechanism is discussed. The effectiveness of the optimal ligand was evaluated on various aromatic and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones, producing the corresponding alcohols with up to 98.8% ee and good yields."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Sun", "ForeName": "Hao", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Dai", "ForeName": "Pinli", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Tian", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Xu", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Qian", "Initials": "Q"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Linlin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Meng", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2608-8587"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Lin", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-4890-109X"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants & School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guizhou Medical University, 550004 Guiyang, China. scuchunli@163.com."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Chun", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Org Biomol Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101154995", "ISSNLinking": "1477-0520"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "6", "Day": "28", "Hour": "3", "Minute": "53"}], "PublicationStatus": "epublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37376925", "10.1039/d3ob00371j"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
