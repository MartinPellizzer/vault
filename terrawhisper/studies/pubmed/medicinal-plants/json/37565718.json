In addition to consuming AA-containing herbal medicinal products, there is emerging evidence that humans are also exposed to AA through the environment. In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for global action to remove AA exposure sources and to implement preventative measures against the development of AA-associated cancers. Herein, we report the development of a simple and efficient iron powder-packed reduction column that allows online post-column conversion of the nonfluorescing AA to its corresponding strongly fluorescing aristolactam (AL), facilitating the sensitive and selective detection of AA in herbal medicinal products, food grain, arable soil, or groundwater samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Moreover, AL, a group of naturally occurring derivatives of AA that have demonstrated toxicity to cultured bacteria, human cells, and rats, is monitored and quantified simultaneously with AA in one single run without sacrificing sensitivity. In comparison with existing analytical methods for AA measurement, the newly developed method is not only inexpensive and less laborious, but it also offers improved sensitivity. We believe this novel method will find wide application in identifying the presence of AA in food, herbal medicines, and environmental samples, thus assisting in the identification and removal of AA exposure sources."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chin", "ForeName": "Man-Lung", "Initials": "ML"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-2204-4907"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Au", "ForeName": "Chun-Kit", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-7963-8725"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Chi-Kong", "Initials": "CK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Long", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-9861-0573"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, University of Ni\u0161, Vi\u0161egradska 33, 18000 Ni\u0161, Serbia."}], "LastName": "\u017divkovi\u0107 Sto\u0161i\u0107", "ForeName": "Milena Z", "Initials": "MZ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, University of Ni\u0161, Vi\u0161egradska 33, 18000 Ni\u0161, Serbia."}], "LastName": "\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 Zlatkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Miljana R", "Initials": "MR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences and Mathematics, University of Ni\u0161, Vi\u0161egradska 33, 18000 Ni\u0161, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Zlatkovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Dragan", "Initials": "D"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Serbian Medical Society, 18000 Ni\u0161, Serbia."}], "LastName": "Pavlovi\u0107", "ForeName": "Nikola M", "Initials": "NM"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8479-3172"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemistry, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon 999077, Hong Kong."}], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "Wan", "Initials": "W"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Anal Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "0370536", "ISSNLinking": "0003-2700"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Aristolochic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "42"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "12", "Minute": "43"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "8", "Day": "11", "Hour": "8", "Minute": "43"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37565718", "10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01874"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
