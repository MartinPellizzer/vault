Structure of compounds <b>1-2</b> were confirmed by intensive NMR and mass spectrometry studies. The coral extract and the obtained compounds were examined against a set of diverse microorganisms. The <i>in\u00a0vitro</i> anti-cancer properties were assessed against colon (Caco-2) and breast (MCF-7) cell lines together with their exerted cytotoxicity on the immortalized normal epithelium (hTERT-RPE1) cell type. The anti-angiogenic power was also highlighted through suppressing MCF-7 cell migration and the significant inactivation of VEGFR2 enzyme.
