Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), due to the unique mechanical strength and piezoelectric properties, can be a good choice for making a bone bioimplant. In the present study, PVDF nanofibers and film were fabricated as 3D and 2D scaffolds, and then, osteogenic differentiation potential of the human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was investigated when grown on the scaffolds by evaluating the common osteogenic markers in comparison with tissue culture plate. Biocompatibility of the fabricated scaffolds was confirmed qualitatively and quantitatively by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and scanning electron microscopy assays. Human iPSCs cultured on PVDF nanofibers showed a significantly higher alkaline phosphate activity and calcium content compared with the iPSCs cultured on PVDF film. Osteogenic-related genes and proteins were also expressed in the iPSCs seeded on PVDF nanofibers significantly higher than iPSCs seeded on PVDF film, when investigated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. According to the results, the PVDF nanofibrous scaffold showed a greater osteoinductive property compared with the PVDF film and due to the material similarity of the scaffolds, it could be concluded that the 3D structure could lead to better bone differentiation. Taken together, the obtained results demonstrated that human iPSC-seeded PVDF nanofibrous scaffold could be considered as a promising candidate for use in bone tissue engineering applications."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical Sciences, Yasuj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Mirzaei", "ForeName": "Ali", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Immunogenetics, Bu-Ali Research Institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Moghadam", "ForeName": "Abbas Shapouri", "Initials": "AS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Tehran Medical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Abazari", "ForeName": "Mohamad Foad", "Initials": "MF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Nejati", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Genetics, Tehran Medical Sciences Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Torabinejad", "ForeName": "Sepehr", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Kaabi", "ForeName": "Mohamad", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0003-4516-5944"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunogenetics Research Center, Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran."}], "LastName": "Enderami", "ForeName": "Seyed Ehsan", "Initials": "SE"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0001-8858-8635"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Tissue engineering and Applied Cell Sciences, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."}], "LastName": "Ardeshirylajimi", "ForeName": "Abdolreza", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Medical Biotechnology, Faculty of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Science, Arak, Iran."}], "LastName": "Darvish", "ForeName": "Maryam", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": ["0000-0002-1215-1143"], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Dietary Supplements and Probiotic Research Center, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, Karaj, Iran."}], "LastName": "Soleimanifar", "ForeName": "Fatemeh", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Immunogenetic and Cell Culture Department, Immunology Research Center, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran."}], "LastName": "Saburi", "ForeName": "Ehsan", "Initials": "E"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "0050222", "ISSNLinking": "0021-9541"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polyvinyls"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24937-79-9", "NameOfSubstance": "polyvinylidene fluoride"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Bone and Bones"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Differentiation"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Cell Proliferation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Nanofibers"}, {"QualifierName": ["physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Osteogenesis"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Polyvinyls"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Engineering"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Tissue Scaffolds"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "12", "Day": "8"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "2", "Day": "14"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2020", "Month": "5", "Day": "20", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "3", "Day": "10", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30851069", "10.1002/jcp.28415"]}}]}
