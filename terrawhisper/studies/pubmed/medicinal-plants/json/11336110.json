Schum. were examined in the rat isolated mesenteric arteries. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed that cardamonin is present in trans-form, and single-crystal radiographic structure revealed that alpinetin is present in S configuration. Both cardamonin and alpinetin produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner, and they induced relaxation of phenylephrine-preconstricted arteries with respective mean inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 9.3+/-0.6 microM and 27.5+/-2.8 microM. Both compounds also relaxed arteries preconstricted by endothelin I or U46619. Their relaxant effects were decreased in endothelium-removed rings. Pretreatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or methylene blue inhibited relaxation induced by both agents, and pretreatment with L-arginine reversed the effect of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester on cardamonin-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. The relaxant effects of cardamonin and alpinetin were unaffected by indomethacin (3 microM). Cardamonin and alpinetin inhibited 60 mM K+-induced contraction with respective IC50 of 11.5+/-0.3 microM and 37.9+/-3.6 microM. In addition, both agents inhibited the transient contraction induced by 3 microM phenylephrine or by 10 mM caffeine in Ca2+-free Krebs solution. Finally, these two agents also concentration dependently relax the arteries preconstricted by 1 microM phorbol 12,13-diacetate in Ca2+-free Krebs solution. These results indicate that purified cardamonin and alpinetin from A. henryi K. Schum. relaxed rat mesenteric arteries through multiple mechanisms. They induced both endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation; the former is likely mediated by nitric oxide whereas the latter is probably mediated through nonselective inhibition of Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release and inhibition of the protein kinase C-dependent contractile mechanism."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacognosy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Z T", "Initials": "ZT"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Lau", "ForeName": "C W", "Initials": "CW"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chan", "ForeName": "F L", "Initials": "FL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Yao", "ForeName": "X", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Chen", "ForeName": "Z Y", "Initials": "ZY"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "He", "ForeName": "Z D", "Initials": "ZD"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Cardiovasc Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7902492", "ISSNLinking": "0160-2446"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Chalcones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavanones"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Flavonoids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Vasodilator Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "alpinetin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "1WS297W6MV", "NameOfSubstance": "Phenylephrine"}, {"RegistryNumber": "31C4KY9ESH", "NameOfSubstance": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "H8KP1OJ8JX", "NameOfSubstance": "cardamonin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "P460GTI853", "NameOfSubstance": "scutellarein"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chalcones"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Endothelium, Vascular"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Flavanones"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Flavonoids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Mesenteric Arteries"}, {"QualifierName": ["antagonists & inhibitors"], "DescriptorName": "Nitric Oxide"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phenylephrine"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstriction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasoconstrictor Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilation"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Vasodilator Agents"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "10", "Day": "19", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "2001", "Month": "5", "Day": "5", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["11336110", "10.1097/00005344-200105000-00011"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
