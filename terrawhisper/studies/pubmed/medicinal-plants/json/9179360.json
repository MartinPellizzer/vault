(mistletoe) extracts are widely used in adjuvant cancer therapy. In contrast to purified components, such as mistletoe lectins and viscotoxins, whole plant extracts of mistletoe resulted in DNA stabilizations in cyclophosphamide-treated lymphocytes but also provided cytotoxicity in tumour cells and lymphocytes. The killing capacities of mistletoe extracts were host tree-specific and not correlated with mistletoe lectin or viscotoxin content. In human lymphocytes, only mistletoe lectins induced a pathway of apoptotic killing. Within 72 h, the lectin B chains also increased the number of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis. This finding suggests that inhibition of protein synthesis by the A chain of the hololectin may accelerate a receptor-mediated killing pathway induced by the B chains. An unexpected finding was related to the mistletoe-mediated killing, which was more effective against CD8+T cells with an activated phenotype than CD19+ B cells and CD4+ T cells. In vitro treatment of human neutrophils with mistletoe resulted in a slight decrease of phagocytosis and burst activity. The observed dose-dependent occurrence of two neutrophil subsets with different burst activities indicates differences in their susceptibility to mistletoe and suggests the implication of an induction of the apoptotic killing pathway."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Applied Immunology, Communal Hospital Herdecke, Germany."}], "LastName": "B\u00fcssing", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suzart", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Schweizer", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Drugs", "NlmUniqueID": "9100823", "ISSNLinking": "0959-4973"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9M140C3R39", "NameOfSubstance": "viscotoxin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimutagenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Apoptosis"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "physiology"], "DescriptorName": "Granulocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Toxins, Biological"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Trees"}], "NumberOfReferences": "30"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9179360", "10.1097/00001813-199704001-00003"]}}]}
