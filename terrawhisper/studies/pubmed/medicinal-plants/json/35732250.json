Nonetheless, traditional nanomedicine faces significant obstacles such as the low concentration of the drug at target sites and accelerated removal of the drug from blood circulation. Various techniques of nanotechnology, including cell membrane coating, have been developed to address these challenges and to improve targeted distribution and redcue cell membrane-mediated immunogenicity. Recently, stem cell (SC) membranes, owing to their immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, have grabbed attention as attractive therapeutic carriers for targeting specific tissues or organs. Bioengineering strategies that combine synthetic nanoparticles (NPs) with SC membranes, because of their homing potential and tumor tropism, have recently received a lot of publicity. Several laboratory experiments and clinical trials have indicated that the benefits of SC-based technologies are mostly related to the effects of SC-derived exosomes (SC-Exos). Exosomes are known as nano-sized extracellular vehicles (EVs) that deliver particular bioactive molecules for cell-to-cell communication. In this regard, SC-derived exosome membranes have recently been employed to improve the therapeutic capability of engineered drug delivery vehicles. Most recently, for further enhancing NPs' functionality, a new coating approach has been offered that combines membranes from two separate cells. These hybrid membrane delivery vehicles have paved the way for the development of biocompatible, high-efficiency, biomimetic NPs with varying hybrid capabilities that can overcome the drawbacks of present NP-based treatment techniques. This review explores stem cell membranes, SC-Exos, and hybrid SC-camouflaged NPs preparation methods and their importance in cancer therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2022.
