However, the quality of the preparation is uneven in the market, so its clinical efficacy cannot be guaranteed. In order to improve and establish its quality control standard, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to establish the fingerprint of Xinshenghua Keli. The detection was performed on Agilent 5 HC-C\u2081\u2088 (2) column(4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm, 5 microns) with methanol-0.1% formic acid solution as mobile phase for gradient elution, at a flow rate of 1 mL\u00b7min\u207b\u00b9 with column temperature of 25 \u00b0C. The injection volume was 10 \u03bcL and detection wavelength was set at the maximum value between 210.0 nm and 400.0 nm by Photo-Diode Array (PDA) detector. The fingerprint of 12 batches of high-quality Xinshenghua Keli was established and 43 common peaks were identified. The similarities of crowned products, 10 batches of ordinary ones made by Jiangsu Rongyu Pharmaceutical and 10 batches produced by different manufacturers were evaluated. The composition identification and source analysis for the common peaks were performed by comparing the retention time of herbal medicines and ultraviolet absorption spectrum, along with high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) technology. The established fingerprint of Xinshenghua Keli, has proven to have good precision, stability and repeatability through the methodology validation, so it can be used to comprehensively evaluate the quality of Xinshenghua Keli."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zuo", "ForeName": "Wen-Wen", "Initials": "WW"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Wu", "ForeName": "Xin", "Initials": "X"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Rongyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Huaian 223200, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Sheng-Liang", "Initials": "SL"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Cun-Yu", "Initials": "CY"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Yun-Feng", "Initials": "YF"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing 210023, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Chinese Medicinal Resources Industrialization, Nanjing 210023, China."}], "LastName": "Peng", "ForeName": "Guo-Ping", "Initials": "GP"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Phytochemicals"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mass Spectrometry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Phytochemicals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Quality Control"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "3", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "11", "Day": "6", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "7", "Day": "26", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["30384532", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20180702.006"]}}]}
