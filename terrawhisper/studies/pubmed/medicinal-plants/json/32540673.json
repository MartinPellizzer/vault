Vegetables from this family have been used for centuries, not only for consumption, but also for their medicinal value. The most characteristic cucurbits are pumpkin and cucumber, which are cultivated and consumed in many parts of the world. Seeds from cucurbits have many health benefits and are a popular snack. Cucurbit plants are rich in carotenoids, terpenoids, saponins, and phytochemicals. Vegetables from the Cucurbitaceae family have a positive influence on human health, and various studies have clearly indicated that cucurbit vegetables have antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiinflammatory, and purgative properties. This mini review evaluates the current literature about vegetables from the Cucurbitaceae family and their products, in addition to their positive effect on human health."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 Elsevier Inc.
