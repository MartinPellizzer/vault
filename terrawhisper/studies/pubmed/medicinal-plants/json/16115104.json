Selection was based on their use by traditional Thai healers or their reported antimicrobial activities in an attempt to find bioactive medicines for use in the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections in AIDS patients. The disc diffusion and hyphal extension-inhibition assays were primarily used to test for inhibition of growth. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by dilution methods. The chloroform extracts of Alpinia galanga and Boesenbergia pandurata had pronounced antifungal activity against C. neoformans and M. gypseum, but exhibited weak activity against C. albicans. Alpinia galanga and B. pandurata are excellent candidates for the development of a remedy for opportunistic fungal infections in AIDS patients."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Natural Products Research Unit and Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand. souwalak.p@psu.ac.th"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Phongpaichit", "ForeName": "Souwalak", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Subhadhirasakul", "ForeName": "Sanan", "Initials": "S"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Wattanapiromsakul", "ForeName": "Chatchai", "Initials": "C"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Mycoses", "NlmUniqueID": "8805008", "ISSNLinking": "0933-7407"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Infective Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antifungal Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "pathogenicity"], "DescriptorName": "Fungi"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Microbial Sensitivity Tests"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Thailand"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "11", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "8", "Day": "24", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["16115104", "10.1111/j.1439-0507.2005.01142.x", "MYC1142"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
