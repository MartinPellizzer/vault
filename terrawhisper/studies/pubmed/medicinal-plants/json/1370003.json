Production medium was circulated through the reactor parallel to the upper surface of the horizontal biofilm. Sugar consumption and indole alkaloid formation were followed to compare the performance of cultures with different biofilm thicknesses. Dissolved oxygen concentrations gradients within the biofilms were determined at the end of each run. RNA and protein content of the cells in the upper and lower layers of the the biofilms were compared. Results obtained in the biofilm experiments were compared to those obtained with suspension cultures. At optimized biofilm thicknesses, the biofilm reactor was more effective than suspension cultures in maximizing indole alkaloid titers. This is thought to be due to better cell-cell contact within the biofilm and nutrient concentration gradients, which resulted in low growth rates."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130."}], "LastName": "Kargi", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Ganapathi", "ForeName": "B", "Initials": "B"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Maricic", "ForeName": "K", "Initials": "K"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "Journal Article", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Biotechnol Prog", "NlmUniqueID": "8506292", "ISSNLinking": "1520-6033"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Alkaloids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Proteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "63231-63-0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA"}, {"RegistryNumber": "9002-18-0", "NameOfSubstance": "Agar"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Agar"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Alkaloids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Metabolism"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cells, Cultured"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Indoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Proteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "RNA"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1990", "Month": "7", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1370003", "10.1021/bp00004a002"]}}]}
