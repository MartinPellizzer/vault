Recent studies reveal that adaptogens are pleiotropically-acting chemical constituents that can be isolated from traditional herbs. They are gaining increasing attention in cancer chemotherapy. This review summarizes the physiological action of adaptogens isolated from the 9 most widely used traditional herbs implicated in cancer therapy viz., Withania somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, Rhodiola rosea, Emblica officinalis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Bacopa monnieri, Asparagus racemosus, Ocimum sanctum, and Panax notoginseng. The studies were identified through a systematic search of major computerized databases such as Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Inflibnet, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. Individual names of each herb and biological action were the search terms employed. In this review, we have enlisted the chemical constituents and their mechanism of action in a few organ systems as well as in cancer cells. Studies indicate that the adaptogens isolated from these herbs can be broadly arranged into 2 classes based on their chemical structure. These molecules exert a positive influence on several organ systems such as respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, immune, and gastrointestinal tracts. It is also clear that adaptogens act as effective chemopreventive agents alone or in combination with chemo drugs in multiple cancers by targeting multiple intracellular target proteins. Therefore, we conclude that adaptogens are versatile ligands capable of eliciting many systemic effects. Their biological functions are complex, varied, and context-dependent in various cancers. This offers great scope for personalized treatment and cancer chemoprevention in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Senior Faculty, Biological Sciences, Fatima College of Health Sciences, Ajman, UAE."}], "LastName": "Sulaiman", "ForeName": "Mahaboob Khan", "Initials": "MK"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Surgery, Price Institute of Surgical Research, University of Louisville, Louisville KY 40202, USA."}], "LastName": "Lakshmanan", "ForeName": "Jaganathan", "Initials": "J"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Review"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Netherlands", "MedlineTA": "Anticancer Agents Med Chem", "NlmUniqueID": "101265649", "ISSNLinking": "1871-5206"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anticarcinogenic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antineoplastic Agents"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rhodiola"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2021", "Month": "11", "Day": "18"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "1", "Day": "21"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "2", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "12", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "8", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2022", "Month": "4", "Day": "11", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "23"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["35400325", "10.2174/1871520622666220408091610", "ACAMC-EPUB-122377"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
