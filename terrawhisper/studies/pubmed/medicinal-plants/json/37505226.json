Gallic acid has been identified as one of the most significant biological elicitors. At dosages of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20\u2009mg/L, Gallic acid was sprayed on chamomile plants. The yield of flowers and essential oils in dry flowers were assessed. The averages of data were examined statistically using one-way analysis of variance. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were a major chemical group, while \u03b1-bisabolol oxide A, \u03b1-bisabolol and chamazulene were the three main components of essential oil. When administered 15\u2009mg/L Gallic acid, plants produced their most flowers and had the highest quantities of the essential oil, \u03b1-bisabolol oxide A, \u03b1-bisabolol and chamazulene. Essential oil extracted from untreated control plants had the highest concentration of oxygenated sesquiterpenes. It can be infer that Gallic acid increases the production of essential oil and alters its chemical constituents which alter its biological activity."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Botany Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Dokki, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Ahmed", "ForeName": "Aisha M A", "Initials": "AMA"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Department, National Research Centre, Cairo, Dokki, Egypt."}], "LastName": "Khalid", "ForeName": "Khalid A", "Initials": "KA"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Nat Prod Res", "NlmUniqueID": "101167924", "ISSNLinking": "1478-6419"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"RegistryNumber": "632XD903SP", "NameOfSubstance": "Gallic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "24WE03BX2T", "NameOfSubstance": "bisabolol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Azulenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "Z439UH6E5F", "NameOfSubstance": "chamazulene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Oils"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Oils, Volatile"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Flowers"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Gallic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Chamomile"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Monocyclic Sesquiterpenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Azulenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Oils"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2024", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "14", "Minute": "46"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "13", "Minute": "10"}, {"Year": "2023", "Month": "7", "Day": "28", "Hour": "10", "Minute": "54"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["37505226", "10.1080/14786419.2023.2241152"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
