As the majority of chemotherapeutic medications are associated with recurrence, drug resistance, and side effects, scientists are shifting to beneficial agents for prevention and treatment, such as natural molecules. Myricetin 3-rhamnoside, a natural flavonol glycoside is known for diverse pharmacological activities but fewer reports describe the antiproliferative ability. The study aims to investigate the antiproliferative efficacy and target [hyaluronidase (HYAL) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), two poor breast cancer prognostic markers] modulatory potential of myricetin 3-rhamnoside on breast cancer cell lines using cytotoxicity assays and <i>in silico</i> docking, molecular dynamics analysis, cell-free and cell-based test methods. Myricetin 3-rhamnoside significantly retard the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in SRB (IC<sub>50</sub> 88.64\u2009\u00b1\u20097.14\u2009\u00b5M) and MTT (56.26\u2009\u00b1\u20098.50\u2009\u00b5M) assay. It suppressed the transition of cells to the S-phase by inducing arrest in the G0/G1 phase with a fold change of 1.10. It shows robust binding interaction with ODC (-7.90\u2009kcal/mol) and HYAL (-9.46\u2009kcal/mol) and inhibits ODC (15.22\u2009\u00b1\u20092.61\u2009\u00b5M) and HYAL (11.92\u2009\u00b1\u20092.89\u2009\u00b5M) activity, but in a cell-based assay, the prominent response was observed against HYAL (21.46\u2009\u00b1\u20094.03\u2009\u00b5M). Besides, it shows a 1.38 fold-down regulation of HYAL and forms a stable complex with HYAL. The binding pocket for myricetin 3-rhamnoside and the simulation pocket during the simulation are identical, indicating that myricetin 3-rhamnoside is actively blocking hyaluronidase. The computational prediction suggests it is a safe molecule. These observations imply that myricetin 3-rhamnoside could be used as a pharmacophore to design and synthesize a novel and safe agent for managing hormone-independent breast cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
