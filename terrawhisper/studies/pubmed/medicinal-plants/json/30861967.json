Moench; Asteraceae), a perennial herb originating from North America, is used as a garden ornamental and is grown commercially for use in medicinal preparations as an immunostimulant. In October 1996, a previously undescribed stem rot disease was observed in a research plot of 6-month-old echinacea plants at Brooks. Seedlings had been raised in small rockwool cubes (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 5 cm<sup>3</sup>) in a greenhouse, then transplanted into the field in early June. By late August, dead and dying plants were observed throughout the stand. They had dark brown to black stem lesions above and at the soil level and dead leaves with bleached petiole lesions that extended ca. 15 cm above the axil. Diseased stems and petioles often disintegrated, leaving only fibrous tissues intact. Roots were rotted and black. Superficial white mycelium developed over the basal part of affected stems. Black, oblong to irregular-shaped sclerotia, 5.1 to 17.6 mm in size, formed externally on the crown areas after plant death. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (1) was isolated from the diseased plants. Five isolates were selected to fulfill Koch's postulates with 3-month-old echinacea seedlings grown in 12-cm pots of soilless mix. Sclerotia from wilted, field-grown echinacea plants were transferred onto potato dextrose agar medium for 2 days at 20\u00b0C. Agar disks were cut with a 1-cm cork borer and two plugs containing sclerotial and mycelial tissues were inserted into the soilless mix 0.5 cm deep and 0.5 cm from the opposite sides of stems of test plants. Inoculated plants were enclosed in transparent plastic bags for 5 days and incubated in a growth chamber at 15/18\u00b0C (night/day) with a 12-h photoperiod. One to four lower leaves per plant wilted within 1 week after inoculation and aerial mycelia appeared on the petioles. Infected leaves quickly withered, dried, and dropped off the plant after the bags were removed. Plants often died 3 weeks after inoculation and S. sclerotiorum was reisolated from infected crown tissues. This disease was also found on 3-year-old plants of E. pallida (Nutt.) Nutt. var. angustifolia (DC.) Cronq. in Vernon, British Columbia, Canada, in May 1997. This is the first report of sclerotinia stem rot on Echinacea spp., a disease that could have a significant impact on the longevity and productivity of this crop in the field and greenhouse.
