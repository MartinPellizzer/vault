Knowledge of chemical composition of these materials is important as it pertains to health. The activity concentrations of 232Th, 226Ra and 40K were measured in twenty-six medicinal plant samples purchased from different local Saudi markets using \u03b3- spectrometry with a NaI[Tl] detector. They ranged between 0.50?0.04 to 13.72?1.15 Bq kg\u208b\u2081, 0.45?0.04 to 12.73?1.02 Bq kg-1and 7.00?0.50 to 327.06?11.0 Bq kg\u208b\u2081, respectively. The radium equivalent activity and absorbed dose rate in the studied samples varied from 1.21 to 54.45 Bq kg\u208b\u2081 and from 0.55 to 28.24 nGyh-1, respectively. Intake of radionuclides in samples was insignificant. Consequently, these samples were considered safe in terms of radiological health hazards. The concentration of six heavy metals: Cd, Pb, As, Cu, Mn and Zn were monitored by inductively coupled plasma optical emission and some of them were found above permissible limit."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Alharbi", "ForeName": "W R", "Initials": "WR"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "India", "MedlineTA": "J Environ Biol", "NlmUniqueID": "8300544", "ISSNLinking": "0254-8704"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Radioactive Pollutants"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Environmental Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Metals, Heavy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radiation Monitoring"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Radioactive Pollutants"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Saudi Arabia"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "19", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "9", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "2", "Day": "23", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29251467"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
