In this trial, the symptoms associated with this local reaction were investigated. Furthermore the occurrence of local reactions was tried to correlate with an increase in CD3/25- and CD8/38-positive lymphocyte counts, with eosinophilic granulocyte numbers, and with the formation of mistletoe lectin antibodies. Included in the trial were 30 HIV-antibody-positive patients and 17 healthy non-smokers, aged 24-51 years. The CD4 cell count in the HIV-negative subjects was > 800/microliter, compared with 200-600/microliter in the HIV-positive patients. All study participants had a Karnofsky score > or = 70. The trial subjects were observed over a period of 18 weeks. With escalation of the dose of a fermented and unfermented extract of Viscum album L. (Iscador Qu Spezial and Viscum album QuFrF), there was an increase in local reactions. Erythema at the injection site was the most frequently reported symptom. Between the doses and the symptoms induration, swelling and pruritus were marked correlations. Effects of the application of mistletoe extracts on the immune system were demonstrated by an increase in CD3/25-positive lymphocyte counts and antibodies against mistletoe-lectins. There were no changes in eosinophilic granulocytes or CD8/38-positive lymphocyte populations. For evaluation of the therapeutic applications of mistletoe extracts in HIV-positive patients it is advisable to assess primarily activation of CD3-positive lymphocytes and the patient response on the basis of the local reaction. The local inflammatory reaction at the injection site is desirable and well tolerated if the reaction is smaller than 5 cm in diameter."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "European Institute for Oncological and Immunological Research, Berlin, Germany. robert.gorter@eifoi.de"}], "LastName": "Stoss", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "van Wely", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Musielsky", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Gorter", "ForeName": "R W", "Initials": "RW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Randomized Controlled Trial", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Arzneimittelforschung", "NlmUniqueID": "0372660", "ISSNLinking": "0004-4172"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD3 Complex"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "CD8 Antigens"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Lectins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptors, Interleukin-2"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Adjuvants, Immunologic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "CD3 Complex"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "CD8 Antigens"}, {"QualifierName": ["pathology"], "DescriptorName": "Drug Eruptions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Fermentation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "HIV Seronegativity"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood", "drug therapy", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "HIV Seropositivity"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Injections, Subcutaneous"}, {"QualifierName": ["immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Mistletoe"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "immunology"], "DescriptorName": "Neutrophils"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "adverse effects", "therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Lectins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["blood"], "DescriptorName": "Receptors, Interleukin-2"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Time Factors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "25"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "5", "Day": "25", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10337457", "10.1055/s-0031-1300428"]}}]}
