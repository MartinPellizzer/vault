VR-ACS6 was specifically induced in response to the auxin signal. The IAA-induction of VR-ACS6 was very rapid (within 30 min) and insensitive to cycloheximide treatment at concentrations up to 100 microM. Significant accumulation of VR-ACS6 mRNA was detected at 1 microM IAA. The IAA-induced expression of VR-ACS6 was suppressed by ABA and ethylene, but enhanced by BA. These characteristics of VR-ACS6 expression were well correlated with the physiological data of auxin-induced ethylene production in mungbean hypocotyls. VR-ACS1 was strongly induced by cycloheximide, but was found to be not auxin-specific. Inhibitors of either ethylene biosynthesis (AOA) or action (NBD) increased the basal level of VR-ACS1 mRNA."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biology, Yonsei University, Seoul, Republic of Korea."}], "LastName": "Yoon", "ForeName": "I S", "Initials": "IS"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Mori", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kim", "ForeName": "J H", "Initials": "JH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Kang", "ForeName": "B G", "Initials": "BG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Imaseki", "ForeName": "H", "Initials": "H"}], "DataBankList": [{"DataBankName": "GENBANK", "AccessionNumberList": ["AB000679"]}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Plant Cell Physiol", "NlmUniqueID": "9430925", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0781"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Ethylenes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "14I68GI3OQ", "NameOfSubstance": "Aminooxyacetic Acid"}, {"RegistryNumber": "91GW059KN7", "NameOfSubstance": "ethylene"}, {"RegistryNumber": "98600C0908", "NameOfSubstance": "Cycloheximide"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Lyases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 4.4.1.14", "NameOfSubstance": "1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylate synthase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acid Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Aminooxyacetic Acid"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Base Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Cloning, Molecular"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Cycloheximide"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Enzyme Induction"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ethylenes"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Gene Expression Regulation, Plant"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Indoleacetic Acids"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "chemistry", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Lyases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Transcription, Genetic"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1997", "Month": "3", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["9150600", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.pcp.a029156"]}}]}
