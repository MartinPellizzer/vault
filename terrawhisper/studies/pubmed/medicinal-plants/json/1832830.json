An analysis of the pooled glycoproteins from the seedlings suggested that the most common glycan structure is a complex one (GlcNAc-Man3GlycNAc2-protein), and consistent with this processing end-product, mannosidases I and II and GlcNAc transferases I and II were all found to be present in the seedling Golgi membrane preparations. The effect of the avidin matrix either in a proximal (biotinyl substrates) or distal (N-(biotinamido)hexonoyl substrates) association with the appropriate glycan substrate for these four enzymes was assessed from the direct comparison of the apparent first-order rate constants for the free and avidin-bound substrate-product conversions. All four plant enzymes were inhibited by the association of the glycan substrates with avidin, but the inhibition was much less pronounced than that observed with the corresponding enzymes from rat liver and hen oviduct. The rate effect shows a progression from 3- to 10-fold rate decreases in the proximal complexes and 2- to 3-fold in the distal complexes in going from the first (mannosidase I) to the fourth (GlcNAc transferase II) enzyme; with the mammalian and avian enzymes the largest effects were for the first ones and much larger absolute rate effects were observed. The results suggest that the nature of the processing enzymes in terms of this response to the avidin glycan substrates may differ in different organisms."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77225."}], "LastName": "Lu", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wold", "ForeName": "F", "Initials": "F"}], "GrantList": [{"GrantID": "GM 31305", "Acronym": "GM", "Agency": "NIGMS NIH HHS", "Country": "United States"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "Arch Biochem Biophys", "NlmUniqueID": "0372430", "ISSNLinking": "0003-9861"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Glycoproteins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Polysaccharides"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.101", "NameOfSubstance": "alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 2.4.1.146", "NameOfSubstance": "beta-1,3-galactosyl-0-glycosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.-", "NameOfSubstance": "Mannosidases"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.113", "NameOfSubstance": "mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.2.1.114", "NameOfSubstance": "mannosyl-oligosaccharide 1,3 - 1,6-alpha-mannosidase"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Carbohydrate Sequence"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Glucosyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": ["genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Glycoproteins"}, {"QualifierName": ["enzymology"], "DescriptorName": "Golgi Apparatus"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Mannosidases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Sequence Data"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Polysaccharides"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1991", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["1832830", "10.1016/0003-9861(91)90020-j", "0003-9861(91)90020-J"]}}]}
