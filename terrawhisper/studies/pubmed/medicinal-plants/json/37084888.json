Urban is an herbaceous perennial plant of the Apiaceae family that has diverse medicinal uses. Its active components are saponin, phenolics, and polyacetylenes. Plant cell cultures have been exploited for the efficient production of metabolites with pharmacological activity. In this work, we prepared adventitious root cultures of C. asiatica and analyzed their content and biological activity. Adventitious root extracts were found to increase glucose uptake by differentiated L6 skeletal muscle cells and to be more efficient than the extract of whole plants. Chromatographic fractionation of the extracts from adventitious roots of C. asiatica led to the isolation of two known polyacetylenes, araliadiol (1) and 8-acetoxy-1,9-pentadecadiene-4,6-diyn-3-ol (2), in addition to a new polyacetylene, which we have named centellidiol (3). All the three polyacetylenes stimulated glucose uptake in a dose-dependent manner. The methanol extract of adventitious roots contained 0.53% and 0.82% of compounds 1 and 2, respectively, which are values that were 15 and 21 times higher that are found in mother plants. We therefore suggest that the high content of these polyacetylenes contributes to the high efficacy of C. asiatica adventitious root cultures. Overall, adventitious root cultures of C. asiatica can be part of a secure supply of effective ingredients including polyacetylenes."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 Elsevier B.V.
