Pronounced antiplasmodial activity was exhibited by methanol extract of the root bark of A. macrophylla with an IC50 value of 5.7 micrograms/ml. Thirteen indole alkaloids were isolated from the active extract. These alkaloids and a semisynthetic bisindole O-acetylmacralstonine were subsequently tested against the K1 strain of P. falciparum. Pronounced antiplasmodial activity was observed mainly among the bisindole alkaloids, particularly villalstonine and macrocarpamine with IC50 values of 0.27 and 0.36 microM, respectively. The potent alkaloids were further tested against T9-96, the chloroquine-sensitive strain of P. falciparum. It has been found that the active alkaloids, in contrast to chloroquine, have significantly higher affinity to the K1 strain than to the T9-96 strain."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, King's College London, U.K."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Keawpradub", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Kirby", "ForeName": "G C", "Initials": "GC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Steele", "ForeName": "J C", "Initials": "JC"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Houghton", "ForeName": "P J", "Initials": "PJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Planta Med", "NlmUniqueID": "0066751", "ISSNLinking": "0032-0943"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Resistance, Multiple"}, {"QualifierName": ["parasitology"], "DescriptorName": "Erythrocytes"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Molecular Structure"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium falciparum"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "2", "Day": "19", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2000", "Month": "1", "Day": "12", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10630106", "10.1055/s-1999-14043"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
