This suggests synergy between immunity and extract activity in treatment. Testing this hypothesis, rodent malaria was used to determine efficacy of Lophira alata leaf extracts in treating malaria in prior infected mice. One round of P. berghei infection and Pyrimethamine drug-cure was used to establish partial immunity in mice. Previously Exposed Mice (PEM) and Previously Unexposed Mice (PUM) mice challenged with P. berghei were used to determine influence of partial antimalarial immunity on efficacy of L. alata leaf extracts, administered alone or in combination with Artesunate (ART) in malaria treatment. There was a significant reduction in parasitemia in PEM when compared to PUM animals (P<0.001) irrespective of treatment regimen. Administration of L. alata combined with ART significantly reduced parasitemia (P<0.0032) and prolonged (P=0.0109) survival than when L. alata was administered alone in infected mice. These findings suggest that the action of L. alata in treating malaria infections in a murine model is enhanced by prior exposure to the malaria parasite. Thus the requirements of using plants in treating malaria in endemic populations may differ for those used in western systems, where trials are carried out with non-immune cohorts. Combining artemisinin derivatives and medicinal plants in malaria exposed populations may provide an alternative control measure in endemic regions and may justify the continued use of these plants by indigenous populations in treating malaria."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart \u00b7 New York."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Parasitology Programme, Department of Zoology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Falade", "ForeName": "Mofolusho O", "Initials": "MO"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Parasitology Programme, Department of Zoology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Komoni", "ForeName": "Favour", "Initials": "F"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Cellular Parasitology Programme, Department of Zoology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria."}], "LastName": "Nwuba", "ForeName": "Roseangela I", "Initials": "RI"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Germany", "MedlineTA": "Drug Res (Stuttg)", "NlmUniqueID": "101602406", "ISSNLinking": "2194-9379"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Antimalarials"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Artemisinins"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "60W3249T9M", "NameOfSubstance": "Artesunate"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Antimalarials"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Artemisinins"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Artesunate"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Malaria"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Ochnaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Leaves"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Plasmodium berghei"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors declare no conflict of interest"}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "9", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "12", "Day": "1", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29190855", "10.1055/s-0043-120759"]}}]}
