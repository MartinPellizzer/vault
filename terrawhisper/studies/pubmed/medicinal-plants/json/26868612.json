The source of this culture can be traced back to prehistoric times. The sacred groves of Parinche valley, Pune district of Maharashtra, India were studied to understand their status and importance in relation to common natural resource bases and cultural aspects. Through formal interviews and non-participatory observation undertaken in all seasons between October 2002 and February 2004, 14 sacred groves were documented. Both EMIC and ETIC dimensions were incorporated in the choice of subjects. The results show that they are important for various communities as a common natural resource base. They promote cultural bonding among various communities and maintain harmony in social life. This can be evidenced during annual village festivals and family celebrations, which invariably take place within the premises of sacred groves. They are also important for biodiversity as many groves function like mini sanctuaries and harbour endemic and threatened plant species. The natural vegetation of the groves comprises many medicinal plants that are regularly harvested by local medicine men ( Vaidus ). Water is a precious resource, especially during summer months, and the perennial water sources that are present in the sacred groves are the only remaining water sources for seven villages. There is a compunction, on the other hand, of the sacred groves being influenced by urbanization, resulting in the building of concrete temples by clearing natural vegetation and planting ornamental and other economically useful trees in the cleared areas of the groves. Such actions alter these fragile ecosystems and deplete or destroy the natural resource base for which this ancient culture is believed to have been originally evolved. We conclude here that sacred groves were originally a common natural resource which were assimilated into the social and cultural life of villages in the Parinche valley. Hence their protection and enhancement should become part of village and forest planning."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Waghchaure", "ForeName": "Chandrakant K", "Initials": "CK"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Tetali", "ForeName": "Pundarikakshudu", "Initials": "P"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Gunale", "ForeName": "Venkat R", "Initials": "VR"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Antia", "ForeName": "Noshir H", "Initials": "NH"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Birdi", "ForeName": "Tannaz J", "Initials": "TJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "England", "MedlineTA": "Anthropol Med", "NlmUniqueID": "9709920", "ISSNLinking": "1364-8470"}}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "13", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "4", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["26868612", "10.1080/13648470500516188"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
