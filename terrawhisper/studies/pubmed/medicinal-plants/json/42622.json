Increased KOH concentrations decrease considerably the inhibitory activity already after 1 h. Maleyation and succinylation of the inhibitor resulted in almost full loss of its trypsin-inhibitory activity but had no effect on the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity. A series of modifications directed towards tyrosyl residues showed that iodination influenced only the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity; however, nitration and arsanilation affected not only the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity but also the trypsin-inhibitory activity. Treatment of the inhibitor with CNBr and chloramine T resulted only in a decrease in the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity indicating that the only methionine is involved in the chymotrypsin-inhibitory activity. When CI-fragment A, previously treated with trypsin at pH 3.75, was further treated with carboxypeptidase B, a release of three lysyl residues per mole protein was found. CI was separated by equilibrium chromatography on SP-Sephadex column into two isoinhibitors, CII and CIII, respectively. Both inhibited trypsin and chymotrypsin with the same specific activity as CI. They differed from each other only in a glutamyl, aspartyl, glycyl and alanyl residue."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Smirnoff", "ForeName": "P", "Initials": "P"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Khalef", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Birk", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Applebaum", "ForeName": "S W", "Initials": "SW"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Denmark", "MedlineTA": "Int J Pept Protein Res", "NlmUniqueID": "0330420", "ISSNLinking": "0367-8377"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Amino Acids"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}, {"RegistryNumber": "EC 3.4.21.1", "NameOfSubstance": "Chymotrypsin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Amino Acids"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemical Phenomena"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Chemistry"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "antagonists & inhibitors", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Chymotrypsin"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Fabaceae"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Trypsin Inhibitors"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1979", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["42622", "10.1111/j.1399-3011.1979.tb01924.x"]}}]}
