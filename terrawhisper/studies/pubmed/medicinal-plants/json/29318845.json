The outdoor sample plot and quadrat survey, literature search, sample collection, in-house identification and classification were performed by route surveying and visiting to the local natives and/or herb farmers based on the current distribution data of the L. ruthenicum resources in the middle and lower reaches of Heihe River. The distributive pattern of the resources was analyzed using ArcGIS program. The data regarding the category/distributed area and the genetic resources of the L. ruthenicum were collected. The data collected in this study may provide the scientific evidence for the protective utilization of the L. ruthenicum resources in the corresponding geographic region, allowing for the avoidance of the ecological environment from being damaged by improper utilization."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Lin", "ForeName": "Li", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Ling", "Initials": "L"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Xin jiang Institutes of Tradit ional Chinese Medica and National Medica, Urumqi 830002, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Xiao-Jin", "Initials": "XJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Cui", "ForeName": "Zhi-Jia", "Initials": "ZJ"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Zhen-Heng", "Initials": "ZH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Gansu University of Chinese Traditional Medicine, Lanzhou 730000, China."}], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Yi", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Lycium"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plant Dispersal"}, {"QualifierName": ["growth & development"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rivers"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "19"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "1", "Day": "11", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2019", "Month": "5", "Day": "8", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["29318845", "10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.2017.0194"]}}]}
