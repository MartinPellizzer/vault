The structure of the compound was identified as a derivative of myricetin having alkyl, hydroxy alkyl and methyl substitutions on the basis of spectral evidences (UV-vis, FT-IR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR and Mass spectra). The isolated compound was interpreted as 2-(2',6'-dimethyl-3',4',5'-alkyl or hydroxy alkyl substituted phenyl)-3-oxy-(alkyl or hydoxy alkyl)- 5,7-dihydroxy-chromen-4-one. In vitro evaluation of anticancer activity against human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) and human erythroleukemic cell line (K562) were conducted using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In vivo anticancer activity was determined against Dalton's Ascites Lymphoma (DAL) in Swiss albino mice. The mice were treated with intraperitoneal administration of the compound at 25mg/kg and 100mg/kg body weight and were compared with the normal, DAL control and standard drug cyclophosphamide treated groups. The histology revealed that the compound could protect the cellular architecture of liver and kidney. The results from the in vitro, in vivo and histological examinations confirmed the ethnopharmacological significance of the isolated compound and could be considered further for the development of an effective drug against cancer."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
