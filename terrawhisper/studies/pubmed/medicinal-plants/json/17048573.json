They were normal group, ICH model groups at 6, 24 h, 3, 7 d and NMC II groups at 6, 24 h, 3, 7 d. ICH models were induced by collagenase type VII-S. Immunohistochemical method was used to detect PAR-1 protein and RT-PCR technique was used to detect PAR-1mRNA in brain tissue around the haematoma at different groups.", "PAR-1 protein and mRNA were mild positive in normal group. In model groups, intensity of PAR-1 expression started to enhance at 6 h, and enhanced more at 24 h. PAR-1 expression reached the peak at 3 d and began to descend. At 7 d the decent was obvious. At 6, 24 h, 3, 7 d time point. The PAR-1 protein positive cell number and PAR-1 mRNA absorbance ratio in ICH model and NMC II groups were significantly higher than those in normal group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The PAR-1 protein positive cell number and PAR-1mRNA absorbance ratio in NMC II group were significantly lower than those in ICH model group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).", "After ICH, PAR-1 is continuously activated because of the simulation of thrombin. Function of thrombin after ICH maybe mediated by PAR-1; NMC II may inhibit the expression of PAR-1. This may be one of the main therapeutics mechanisms of NMC II."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Center of Neurology, Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College, China. gq_zheng@sina.com"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zheng", "ForeName": "Guo-qing", "Initials": "GQ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Pei-xin", "Initials": "PX"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Capsules"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drug Combinations"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Materia Medica"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Receptor, PAR-1"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Acute Disease"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Capsules"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cerebral Hemorrhage"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Combinations"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "isolation & purification", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["administration & dosage", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Materia Medica"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "RNA, Messenger"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Random Allocation"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["biosynthesis", "genetics"], "DescriptorName": "Receptor, PAR-1"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2007", "Month": "9", "Day": "13", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2006", "Month": "10", "Day": "20", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["17048573"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
