Serum hyaluronic (HA) and type precollagen (PCIII) were detected by radioimmunoassay. Degrees of fibrosis and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were determined by histopathology under microscope. Hydroxyproline (Hyp) and the markers of liver function were examined also.", "The levels of serum ALT, AST, ALb, AKP in SSE groups were notably improved as compared with the model group. Serum HA, PCIII and Hyp of hepatic tissue in SSE groups were obviously lower than those of model group. The markers of oxidative stress( SOD, MDA, GSH-Px) were strikingly improved also in SSE groups. HE stains and alpha-SMA expression showed that the degrees of liver fibrosis in SSE groups was slighter than that of model group. There was significant difference between the model group and SSE groups (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The rats in SSE groups were better than those of colchinicines group.", "SSE is able to protect against DMN-induced chronic liver damage, which may act through oxidative stress."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Medical College, Yanbian University, Yanji, Jilin 133000."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Xuewu", "Initials": "X"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Ma", "ForeName": "Chao", "Initials": "C"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Guan", "ForeName": "Liping", "Initials": "L"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Quan", "ForeName": "Yingchun", "Initials": "Y"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Comparative Study", "English Abstract", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhong Yao Cai", "NlmUniqueID": "9426370", "ISSNLinking": "1001-4454"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["therapeutic use"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Wistar"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Rosaceae"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "10", "Day": "8", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2005", "Month": "4", "Day": "27", "Hour": "9", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15850357"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
