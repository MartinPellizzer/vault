Among these plants, 27 species were recorded to have medicinal values for the first time recorded in literature, 23 species were found to have different medicinal functions from those recorded in the literature. Many medicinal herbs are simultaneously wild food plants. The local Yao people take medicinal baths on some special days very common to treat and prevent diseases. The Red-headed Yao medicinal herb doctors have conserved medicinal plants and their habitats over the years. Most of the folk healers are old women, who are concerned about passing on their secrets to the younger generation. They fear that the younger generations have not learned enough about the herbal traditions to keep the practice going. The authors suggest that plants used by the Red-headed Yao people need to be further studied phytochemically and pharmacologically."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Ethnobotany, Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Heilongtan, Kunming, Yunnan 650204, China. long@mail.kib.ac.cn"}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Long", "ForeName": "Chun-lin", "Initials": "CL"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Rong", "Initials": "R"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Ireland", "MedlineTA": "J Ethnopharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "7903310", "ISSNLinking": "0378-8741"}, "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["ethnology"], "DescriptorName": "China"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Ethnobotany"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["methods"], "DescriptorName": "Interviews as Topic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "11", "Day": "30"}, {"Year": "2003", "Month": "10", "Day": "23"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "4", "Day": "13", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2004", "Month": "3", "Day": "12", "Hour": "5", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["15013206", "10.1016/j.jep.2003.10.021", "S0378874103004082"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
