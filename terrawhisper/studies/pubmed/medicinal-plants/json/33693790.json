The potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of P. fulgens root (PRE) for providing protection to mammalian cells exposed to ionising radiation was investigated in this study. The methanolic extract of PRE shows an enhanced radical scavenging ability in a concentration dependent manner. PRE-pre-treatment to stimulated human blood lymphocytes (HBLs) reduced the frequency of deletion and exchange aberrations induced by X-irradiation. Similar protection of chromosome aberrations was also observed in mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs) where mice were given PRE extract (1 mg extract/day/mice) ad libitum in the drinking water for 45 days before whole-body X-irradiation. Of the various extracts prepared by partitioning of the methanol extract, the ethyl-acetate (EA) fraction was found to possess better antioxidant, radical scavenging and DNA-damage reduction activities. PRE-pre-treatment also reduced the radiation-induced cell-cycle delay effectively in HBL. In HEK-293 cells, PRE reduced radiation-induced G2-block in cell kinetics. Interestingly, PRE-treatment alone increased the concentration of endogenous glutathione (GSH) in mouse BMC and in stimulated HBL along with the elevated expression of \u03b3-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase heavy/catalytic subunit, a key determinant of GSH synthesis. Studies on expression of two DNA-repair genes revealed that there was a marked increase in the expression of GADD45 and H2AX genes after X-irradiation in stimulated HBL, and such expression was reduced significantly if PRE-treatment was given prior to radiation. The present findings show the ability of PRE to reduce radiation-induced DNA damages probably by free radical scavenging whereas modulation of expression of DNA-repair genes' and endogenous GSH-increment emerge as effective strategies. The present study is the first report on the selected medicinal plant species that suggests it to be a potential natural radioprotector when used as root extract or its EA fraction for mitigating radiation toxicity."], "CopyrightInformation": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
