Firstly, the inflammation model in vitro was induced by 1 \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1) LPS in RAW264.7 cells for 24 h. After treatment with 400 \u03bcg\u00b7mL~(-1) I. cappa extract, the pharmacokinetics(PK) of five anti-inflammatory active components, including luteolin(LUT), chlorogenic acid(CA), cryptochlorogenic acid(CCA), 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid(3,4-DCQA), and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid(4,5-DCQA), in normal cells and inflammatory cells was compared. Meanwhile, the PD study was carried out by measuring the inflammatory factors NO and TNF-\u03b1 in the cell supernatant at each time point, which was fitted with PK by the Phoenix Model in the WinNonlin 8.2 to establish the PK-PD model for five components including LUT, CA, CCA, 3,4-DCQA, and 4,5-DCQA. The results showed that compared with normal cells, the model cells showed increased or decreased uptake of five components, advanced T_(max), faster absorption, prolonged MRT and t_(1/2), and increasing or decreasing trend of CL_(z/F) and V_(z/F). When NO was used as the efficacy index, the PK-PD model after the integration of the multi-effect components in I. cappa was E=7.45\u00d7\\[1-Ce~(5.74)/(78.24~(5.74)+Ce~(5.74))\\], while with TNF-\u03b1 as the efficacy index, the PK-PD model after the integration of the multi-effect components in I. cappa was E=79.28\u00d7[1-Ce~(6.45)/(85.10~(6.45)+Ce~(6.45))]. The results of the study suggested that the inflammatory state could change the cellular PK of I. cappa. The anti-inflammatory effect of active components in I. cappa might be related to the down-regulation of the secretion of NO and TNF-\u03b1 in inflammatory cells, and NO and TNF-\u03b1 might serve as the anti-inflammatory targets of active components of I. cappa."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Provincial Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutics
