The methanol extract was extracted with ether, and then the ether soluble fraction was extracted with n-hexane. The n-hexane soluble fraction was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography (Fr-l-Fr-V), and the active principle was isolated from Fr-II by thin layer chromatography (Fr-VI-Fr-VII). The antiinflammatory activity of these fractions was investigated on carrageenin-induced edema in rats and acetic acid-induced vascular permeability in mice. All fractions and indomethacin were suspended in 2% C.M.C. solution and administered p.o. The methanol extract (1.5 g/kg), ether fraction (0.9 g/kg), n-hexane fraction (0.5 g/kg), Fr-II (0.19 g/kg) and Fr-VI (0.17 g/kg) showed a lasting antiinflammatory activity, and the potencies of these fractions were approximately the same as that of indomethacin (10 mg/kg). Fr-VI was determined to be myristicin. These results suggest that the antiinflammatory action of Mace is due to the myristicin that it contains."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Division of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan."}], "LastName": "Ozaki", "ForeName": "Y", "Initials": "Y"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Soedigdo", "ForeName": "S", "Initials": "S"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Wattimena", "ForeName": "Y R", "Initials": "YR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Suganda", "ForeName": "A G", "Initials": "AG"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Japan", "MedlineTA": "Jpn J Pharmacol", "NlmUniqueID": "2983305R", "ISSNLinking": "0021-5198"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxolanes"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Dioxoles"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Extracts"}, {"RegistryNumber": "01Y4A2QXY0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pyrogallol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "04PD6CT78W", "NameOfSubstance": "myristicin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Allylbenzene Derivatives"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Benzyl Compounds"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Capillary Permeability"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxolanes"}, {"QualifierName": ["isolation & purification"], "DescriptorName": "Dioxoles"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemically induced", "drug therapy"], "DescriptorName": "Edema"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Indonesia"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Mice"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis", "pharmacokinetics", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Extracts"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives"], "DescriptorName": "Pyrogallol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rats, Inbred Strains"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1989", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["2487032", "10.1254/jjp.49.155"]}}]}
