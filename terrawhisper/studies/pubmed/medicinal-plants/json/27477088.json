Cheng & T.M.Ai, has therapeutic effects on various disorders, and in particular, bone and joint disease. Despite such ethnomedicinal benefits, there is very little information regarding its in\u00a0vivo toxicity or adverse effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity of the Radix Dipsaci water Extract (RD-wE) by using F344 rats. The RD-wE was administered orally to rats at doses of 0, 125, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw)/day for 13 weeks. During the treatment period there were no mortalities attributed to RD-wE. Moreover, no toxic effects were observed with regard to body weight, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical biochemistry, and urinalysis), and anatomic pathology (gross findings, organ weight, and microscopic examination). The changes related to the treatment were excessive salivation at the mouth and soft feces, observed in male and female rats at 1000 or 2000\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day, but these were not accompanied by any microscopic correlate or other pathophysiological changes. Based on these results, the oral no-observed-adverse-effect level of the RD-wE was considered to be 2000\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day in both genders, although the target organs were not determined under the current experimental conditions."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00c2\u00a9 2016 Elsevier Inc.
