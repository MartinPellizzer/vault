The resulting contamination and environmental pollution have been drawing public attention. In particular, CBZ was reported to cause liver damage in rats and zebrafish, and the mechanisms of its toxicity have not been clarified. The purposes of this study were to investigate the metabolic activation of CBZ and to determine a possible role of the reactive metabolites in CBZ-induced liver injury reported. One oxidative metabolite (M1), one glutathione conjugate (M2), and one <i>N</i>-acetyl cysteine conjugate (M3) were detected in human and rat liver microsomal incubations fortified with glutathione or <i>N</i>-acetyl cysteine after exposure to CBZ. CYP1A2 was the major enzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of CBZ. Biliary M2 and urinary M3 were detected in rats treated with CBZ. CBZ-derived protein adduction was found in cultured rat primary hepatocytes treated with CBZ. The increase of administration concentration intensified not only the cytotoxicity but also protein adduction induced by CBZ, suggesting a correlation of the cytotoxicity with the observed protein modification. The findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms of toxic action of CBZ."]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110016, P.
