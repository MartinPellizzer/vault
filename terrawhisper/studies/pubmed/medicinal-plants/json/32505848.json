While many publications have described the promising anti-bacterial activities of PDT in\u00a0vitro, its applications in\u00a0vivo and in the clinic have been very limited. This limited availability may in part be due to variabilities in the selected photosensitizing agents (PS), the variable testing conditions used to examine anti-bacterial activities and their effectiveness in treating MRSA infections. We thus sought to systematically review and examine the evidence from existing studies on aPDT associated with MRSA and to critically appraise its current state of development and areas to be addressed in future studies. In 2018, we developed and registered a review protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with registration No: CRD42018086736. Three bibliographical databases were consulted (PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE), and a total of 113 studies were included in this systematic review based on our eligibility criteria. Many variables, such as the use of a wide range of solvents, pre-irradiation times, irradiation times, light sources and light doses, have been used in the methods reported by researchers, which significantly affect the inter-study comparability and results. On another note, new approaches of linking immunoglobulin G (IgG), antibodies, efflux pump inhibitors, and bacteriophages with photosensitizers (PSs) and the incorporation of PSs into nano-scale delivery systems exert a direct effect on improving aPDT. Enhanced activities have also been achieved by optimizing the physicochemical properties of the PSs, such as the introduction of highly lipophilic, poly-cationic and site-specific modifications of the compounds. However, few in\u00a0vivo studies (n\u00a0=\u00a017) have been conducted to translate aPDT into preclinical studies. We anticipate that further standardization of the experimental conditions and assessing the efficacy in\u00a0vivo would allow this technology to be further applied in preclinical trials, so that aPDT would develop to become a sustainable, alternative therapeutic option against MRSA infection in the future."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
