The search for new drugs to suppress various types of cardiac arrhythmias has always been the focus of attention. In the past decade, the screening of antiarrhythmic active substances from plants has received extensive attention. These natural compounds have obvious antiarrhythmic effects, and chemical modifications based on natural compounds have greatly increased their pharmacological properties. The chemical modification of botanical antiarrhythmic drugs is closely related to the development of new and promising drugs. Therefore, the structural characteristics and action targets of natural compounds with antiarrhythmic effects are reviewed in this paper, so that pharmacologists can select antiarrhythmic lead compounds from natural compounds based on the disease target - chemical structural characteristics."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2023 The Authors.
