During field surveys conducted in August and September of 2001 and 2002, significant blossom and leaf blight were observed in plant stands located near Budapest and in the northern region of Hungary at Herencs\u00e9ny. Incidence of disease occurrence ranged between 49 and 92%. Abundant grayish-brown mold consisting of mycelia and conidiophores was observed on necrotic flowers and upper leaves. The fungus was identified as Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr.. Conidia were one-celled, ovoid to elliptical, and measured 11.2 \u00d7 7.4 \u03bcm (7.5 to 15.0 \u00d7 5.0 to 10.0 \u03bcm). The fungus was isolated on Leonian malt media. In culture, small and large irregular sclerotia, as well as conidiophores, were produced abundantly. Size of large sclerotia ranged between 45 and 95 mm. Sclerotia were produced only in culture. Pathogenicity of two isolates originating from Herencs\u00e9ny was confirmed by spraying eight sweet basil potted plants with a conidial suspension (6.3 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> conidia/ml) made from a pure culture. Two noninoculated plants served as controls. Half of the plants were wounded with needles to make incisions on the leaves and flower axes prior to the inoculation, while the remaining plants were directly sprayed. After inoculation, plants were kept in plastic bags in a greenhouse to maintain 90 to 100% relative humidity at 15 to 40\u00b0C. After 5 days, water-soaked chlorotic lesions appeared on the wounded leaves of the inoculated plants. After day 12, brown necrosis developed on the flowers of all inoculated plants. Flower axes often broke. Sporulation of the fungus was abundant. Wounding contributed to earlier appearance of the symptoms and more intensive disease development. To our knowledge, this is the first report of botrytis blight on sweet basil in Hungary. In Europe, the disease has been observed in Italy (1) and Greece (2). References: (1) A. Garibaldi et al.
