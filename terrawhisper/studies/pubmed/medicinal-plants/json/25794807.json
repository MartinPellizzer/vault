As there is rapid erosion of traditional knowledge in the state, needs has arisen to document the diversity of medicinal plants, their preparation and associated diseases.", "Attempts have been made to explore the herbal medicines used by the traditional healers belonging to the various communities in North Tripura district of Tripura, India and document the associated traditional knowledge on the utilisation of medicinal plants.", "The study was based on ethnomedicinal field survey covering a period of 1 year from February 2012 to February 2013. The ethnomedicinal information was collected by using semi-structured questionnaires from different healers and knowledge holders. Collected data were analysed through informant consensus factor, Index of Specialisation and Relative frequency of citation to determine culturally significant plants.", "A total of 75 species of plants under 68 genera belonging to 43 families were collected during the study for the treatment of 15 disease categories. Leaves were the most frequently used plant parts and most of the medicines were prepared in the form of extract and administered orally. FIC values of the present study indicated that there was a high agreement in the use of plants in the treatment of digestive system disorders and respiratory system disorders among the healers. Plants having high ISu are Justicia adhatoda, Pajanelia longifolia, Catharanthus roseus etc.", "The present study highlighted certain species having higher priority indices for further phytochemical investigation. Counselling of traditional health practitioners should be taken into consideration in order to smooth continuation and extension of traditional medical knowledge and practice for ensuring safe and effective therapy."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
