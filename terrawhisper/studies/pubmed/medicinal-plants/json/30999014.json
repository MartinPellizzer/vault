Its wide range of use, popularity and high value, make C.\u00a0erythrocarpos containing products a target for economically driven adulteration. This is made worse, by the use of roots, which are unsustainable plant parts. In addition, the mechanism of anti-inflammation is not clearly understood.", "Therefore, this study comparatively evaluated the anti-arthritic and analgesic effects of the leaves, stems and roots of C. erythrocarpos, while elucidating the mechanism of anti-inflammation.", "Using the complete Freund's adjuvant arthritis model, the antiathritic effects were evaluated. The analgesic effects were determined by measuring responses to Von Frey filament number 9. Effects of C.\u00a0erythrocarpos extracts on the levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were determined using ELISA. Haematological and serum biochemical assays were also carried out.", "The leaf, stem and root extracts significantly reduced paw volumes with ED<sub>50</sub> values (mg/kg) of 182.5, 181.5 and 36.4 respectively. The leaf extract at a dose of 100\u202fmg/kg showed substantial analgesic activity with a decrease in the percentage response to Von Frey filament 9. However, there was no significant difference in activities of the leaf, stem and root extracts. Results from ELISA assays show that lower doses of the stem extracts reduce levels of IL-6. Lower doses of all extracts also reduce TNF-\u03b1 levels. Haematological analysis showed extracts reversed elevated WBC and platelet levels. Toxicity evaluation with kidney and liver function tests indicated no significant differences between the treatment and control groups.", "The leaves and stems, just as the roots, have antiarthritic and analgesic effects and can be used as more sustainable alternatives to the roots. This will support the continuous growth of the industry that has developed around C.\u00a0erythrocarpos."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V.
