In this paper literature research and plant taxonomy method were adopted combined with investigation of the markets and clinical use status to clarify the origin of common traditional Mongolian medicine \"Du Ge Mo Nong\". The results showed that the Mongolian medicine \"Du Ge Mo Nong\" and Tibetan medicine \"Du Mu Niu\" were the same crude drug and originated from the seeds of Holarrhena antidysenteriaca of family Apocynaceae in earliest time. In Mongolian medicine clinic, the seed of Cynanchum thesioides of family Asclepiadaceae and the fruit of Forsythia suspense of family Oleaceae was used respectively about 18 century and recent time, as the substitutes of H. antidysenteriaca. In present standards on Mongolian material medicine, C. thesioides is including only, and H. antidysenterica is not used almost. In Tibetan medicine clinic, H. antidysenterica is being used so far. But there are various substitutes including the seeds, fruits or grass of many species classified to family Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae and Onagraceae from ancient time to the present, and C. forrestii and C. komarovii may be used at present. It's necessary to strengthen the arrangement on Mongolian medicine's varieties by the multidisciplinary methods including literature research, investigation of resources and the use state, and comparison of active substances and biological activities between the different substitutes,and so on."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaboration Innovation Center of the Modern Technology and Industrial Development of Jiangxi Minority Traditional Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities, Tongliao 028000, China."}], "LastName": "Xi", "ForeName": "Jie", "Initials": "J"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Chongqing Academy of Chinese Mater Medica, Chongqing 400065, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Hua-Rong", "Initials": "HR"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing 100700, China."}], "LastName": "Wucharila-Tu"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Inner Mongolia University for Nationalities, Tongliao 028000, China."}], "LastName": "Buhe Bater"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaboration Innovation Center of the Modern Technology and Industrial Development of Jiangxi Minority Traditional Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Li", "ForeName": "Hui-Hu", "Initials": "HH"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Collaboration Innovation Center of the Modern Technology and Industrial Development of Jiangxi Minority Traditional Medicine, Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanchang 330004, China."}], "LastName": "Zhong", "ForeName": "Guo-Yue", "Initials": "GY"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Plant Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Apocynaceae"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Cynanchum"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Medicine, Mongolian Traditional"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology", "standards"], "DescriptorName": "Plant Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Seeds"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2016", "Month": "5", "Day": "20"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "22", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2018", "Month": "5", "Day": "31", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28933099", "10.4268/cjcmm20162229"]}}]}
