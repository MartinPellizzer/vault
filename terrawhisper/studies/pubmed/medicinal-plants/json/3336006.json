Both of these agents at concentrations of 100 and 20 microM, respectively, blocked the inotropic effects of ouabain and acetylstrophanthidin (AS) in isolated rabbit atria and papillary muscle preparations. Neither of these agents had any effect of its own on contractile force. Addition of phloretin or cytochalasin-B after the inotropic response to ouabain was fully established did not reverse the effect. The potency of cytochalasin-B was greater in atria than in papillary muscles, 1 microM of cytochalasin caused significant inhibition of the inotropic effect of ouabain in atria without significant effect in papillary muscles. Phloretin but not cytochalasin-B decreased the binding of [3H]ouabain to a semipurified sarcolemmal preparation isolated from canine left ventricular muscle. Neither ouabain nor AS had a substantial positive inotropic effect in atria suspended in substrate-free medium. Substitution of pyruvate (5 mM) for glucose did not fully support their inotropic effect in atria. Papillary muscles behaved differently, in that substrate-free as well as pyruvate media almost fully supported the inotropic effects of ouabain and of low concentrations of AS. Higher concentrations (greater than 250 ng/ml) of As produced a negative inotropic response in substrate-free medium. The possibility that an \"active\" sugar transport system is required for digitalis inotropy is ruled out by the observation that 2-deoxyglucose also prevents the inotropic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"]}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Dalhousie University, Halifax, N.S., Canada."}], "LastName": "Ogbaghebriel", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [], "LastName": "Dresel", "ForeName": "P E", "Initials": "PE"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "United States", "MedlineTA": "J Pharmacol Exp Ther", "NlmUniqueID": "0376362", "ISSNLinking": "0022-3565"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "3CHI920QS7", "NameOfSubstance": "Cytochalasin B"}, {"RegistryNumber": "5ACL011P69", "NameOfSubstance": "Ouabain"}, {"RegistryNumber": "66-28-4", "NameOfSubstance": "Strophanthidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "JG33H36364", "NameOfSubstance": "acetylstrophanthidin"}, {"RegistryNumber": "L628TT009W", "NameOfSubstance": "Isoproterenol"}, {"RegistryNumber": "S5J5OE47MK", "NameOfSubstance": "Phloretin"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Animals"}, {"QualifierName": ["metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Cytochalasin B"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Digitalis"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Isoproterenol"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Male"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects"], "DescriptorName": "Myocardial Contraction"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Ouabain"}, {"QualifierName": ["pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Phloretin"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Toxic"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Rabbits"}, {"QualifierName": ["drug effects", "metabolism"], "DescriptorName": "Sarcolemma"}, {"QualifierName": ["analogs & derivatives", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Strophanthidin"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1988", "Month": "1", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["3336006"]}}]}
