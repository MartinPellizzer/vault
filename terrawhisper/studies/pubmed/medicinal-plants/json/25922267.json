In order to confirm the pharmacological validation of the uses claimed by the informants, monographs from Official International Agencies (ESCOP, Commission E, WHO and EMA) were reviewed. A literature review was conducted focusing on the plants that were widely used but had no published monograph.", "A total of 172 pharmaceutical uses were reported, for 46 plants and 26 families, mainly represented by Lamiaceae (15%), Asteraceae (13%), Rosaceae and Rutaceae (7%, each one), and Clusiaceae, Malvaceae, Papaveraceae and Urticaceae (4%, each one). The most frequently used parts were inflorescence (39%), flowered aerial parts (16%), and aerial parts (13%), followed by inflorescence bract (8%) and leaves (7%). Nine out of 46 plants (20%) and 81 of 172 uses (47%), have already been pharmacologically validated. The remaining 37 plants (of total 46, 80%) have been reported for neurological and mental disorders and need to be screened through standard pharmacological and clinical procedures for their activities. The most used species are Chamaemelum nobile (L.) All., Jasonia glutinosa (L.) DC., and Santolina chamaecyparissus L. ssp. squarrosa (DC.) Nyman, in all cases the administration as infusion.", "Data indicate a high degree of plants knowledge in Navarra regarding neurological and mental disorders. The present study constitutes a good basis for further phytochemical and pharmacological research of C. nobile, J. glutinosa and S. chamaecyparissus, which could be of interest in the design of new inexpensive, effective and safe drugs."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
