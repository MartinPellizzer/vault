Assay 1. Administration of 50 g of glucose dissolved in 125 ml of water (followed by other 150 ml of water). Assay 2. It was carried out one week later in the same women and conditions as assay 1 but adding 10.5 g of Ispaghula husk to the dissolution. In both assays, blood samples were obtained at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 and 120 minutes after administration and glucose concentration was determined in serum.", "The value of the area under the mean glucose concentration-time curve obtained in assay 2 (in the presence of fiber) was a 13.6% lower than that obtained in assay 1 (significant difference, p < or = 0.05). Individual concentration-time curves obtained in assay 1 can be considered as normal in 4 of the 7 volunteers. Abnormalities observed in the other 3 curves were due to: her history of prediabetic in one of them (glucose concentration values over 180 mg/100 ml); diabetic patients in her family in other of them (2 values over 180 mg/100 ml) and hypoglycaemia in two of the volunteers. When we administered glucose with fiber in assay 2, in all cases, the maximum concentration reached was lower, the variations in glycaemia values were also lower along the different sampling times (peaks disappear or are less marked) and no hypoglycaemia appeared."]}, "AuthorList": [{"AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Departamento de Farmacolog\u00eda, Toxicolog\u00eda y Enfermer\u00eda, Universidad de Le\u00f3n, Espa\u00f1a."}], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sierra Vega", "ForeName": "M", "Initials": "M"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Calle Pardo", "ForeName": "A P", "Initials": "AP"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez", "ForeName": "N", "Initials": "N"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "D\u00edez Li\u00e9bana", "ForeName": "M J", "Initials": "MJ"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Sahag\u00fan Prieto", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Su\u00e1rez Gonz\u00e1lez", "ForeName": "A", "Initials": "A"}, {"AffiliationInfo": [], "Identifier": [], "LastName": "Garc\u00eda Vieitez", "ForeName": "J J", "Initials": "JJ"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Clinical Trial", "Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], "VernacularTitle": "Influencia de las cut\u00edculas de semillas de Plantago ovata (Ispaghula husk) en la glucemia posprandial en voluntarias sanas."}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "Spain", "MedlineTA": "Nutr Hosp", "NlmUniqueID": "9100365", "ISSNLinking": "0212-1611"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Blood Glucose"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Adult"}, {"QualifierName": ["analysis"], "DescriptorName": "Blood Glucose"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Female"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Magnoliopsida"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Middle Aged"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}]}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}, {"Year": "1999", "Month": "12", "Day": "10", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["10586614"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
