There are lots of involved reports and studies on interaction problems due to combined used of Chinese medicine and western medicine, however, framework understanding is still rarely seen, affecting the clinical rationality of drug combinations. Actually, the inference ideas of drug interactions in clinical practice are more extensive and practical, and the overall viewpoint and pragmatic idea are the important factors in evaluating the rationality of clinical drug combinations. Based on above points, this paper systemically analyzed the existing information and examples, deeply discuss the embryology background (environment and action mechanism of interactions), and principally divided the interactions into three important and independent categories. Among the three categories, the first category (\u2160approach) was defined as the physical/chemical reactions after direct contact in vivo or in vitro, such as the combination of Chinese medicine injections and western medicine injections (in vitro), combination of bromide and Chinese medicines containing cinnabar (in vivo). The evaluation method for such interactions may be generalized theory of Acid-Base reaction. The second category (\u2161 approach) was defined as the interactions through the pharmacokinetic process including absorption (such as the combination of aspirin and Huowei capsule), distribution (such as the combination of artosin and medicinal herbs containing coumarin), metabolism (such as the combination of phenobarbital and glycyrrhiza) and excretion (such as the combination of furadantin and Crataegi Fructus). The existing pharmacokinetic theory can act as the evaluation method for this type of interaction. The third category (\u2162 approach) was defined as the synergy/antagonism interactions by pharmacological effects or biological pathways. The combination of warfarin and Salvia miltiorrhiza is an example for synergy interaction, while the combination of guanethidine and ephedra is an example for anatagonism interaction. The repeated application of Chinese and western medicine compound preparations and same type of western medicine also belongs to this approach. The receptor competition theory under the view of the overall pathways might act as the evaluation method for this type of interactions. Above all, the research framework on interactions between Chinese medicine and western medicine was proposed, providing overall thinking and support for the essential study on combined application of Chinese medicine and western medicine."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright\u00a9 by the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association."}, "AuthorList": [{"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100038, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chinese Medicine Pharmacovigilance and Rational Drug Use, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Jin", "ForeName": "Rui", "Initials": "R"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chinese Medicine Pharmacovigilance and Rational Drug Use, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Huang", "ForeName": "Jian-Mei", "Initials": "JM"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Department of Pharmacy, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chinese Medicine Pharmacovigilance and Rational Drug Use, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Wang", "ForeName": "Yu-Guang", "Initials": "YG"}, {"Identifier": [], "AffiliationInfo": [{"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "School of Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}, {"Identifier": [], "Affiliation": "Research Center for Chinese Medicine Pharmacovigilance and Rational Drug Use, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing 100029, China."}], "LastName": "Zhang", "ForeName": "Bing", "Initials": "B"}], "PublicationTypeList": ["Journal Article"]}, "MedlineJournalInfo": {"Country": "China", "MedlineTA": "Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi", "NlmUniqueID": "8913656", "ISSNLinking": "1001-5302"}, "ChemicalList": [{"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"RegistryNumber": "0", "NameOfSubstance": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}], "MeshHeadingList": [{"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Drug Therapy, Combination"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry", "pharmacology"], "DescriptorName": "Drugs, Chinese Herbal"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herb-Drug Interactions"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Herbal Medicine"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Humans"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Pharmaceutical Preparations"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Pharmacology"}, {"QualifierName": [], "DescriptorName": "Phytotherapy"}, {"QualifierName": ["chemistry"], "DescriptorName": "Plants, Medicinal"}], "CoiStatement": "The authors of this article and the planning committee members and staff have no relevant financial relationships with commercial interests to disclose."}, "PubmedData": {"ReferenceList": [], "History": [{"Year": "2015", "Month": "7", "Day": "9"}, {"Year": "2017", "Month": "9", "Day": "5", "Hour": "6", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "0"}, {"Year": "2016", "Month": "2", "Day": "1", "Hour": "0", "Minute": "1"}], "PublicationStatus": "ppublish", "ArticleIdList": ["28868879", "10.4268/cjcmm20160332"]}}], "PubmedBookArticle": []}
