Among synthesized compounds, 1-(3-fluorobenzyl)-4-((2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamido)methyl)pyridinium bromide (7l) was found to be the most active compound toward AChE (IC<sub>50</sub>\u202f=\u202f10.14\u202f\u00b5M), 1-(3-chlorobenzyl)-3-((2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamido)methyl)pyridinium bromide (7g) and 1-(2,3-dichlorobenzyl)-3-((2-oxo-2H-chromene-3-carboxamido)methyl)pyridinium chloride (7h) depicted the best BChE inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub>s\u202f=\u202f0.32 and 0.43\u202f\u00b5M, respectively). Although most compounds showed moderate to good anti-AChE activity, their anti-BChE activity was more significant and compound 7g was found as the most selective BChE with SI of 101.18. Also, kinetic study of the compounds 7g and 7l displayed a mixed type inhibition for both AChE and BChE. Furthermore, they were evaluated against \u03b2-secretase; however, they showed low inhibitory activity."], "CopyrightInformation": "Copyright \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.
